"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The first one was this: A Riverdale boy was walking along the bank of a\\ncanal in Hoytville. He saw a boy driving two horses, which were towing a canal-\\nboat. The first horse was lazy, and the boy got angry and struck him several\\ntimes over the head with his whip. The Riverdale boy shouted across to him,\\nbegging him not to be so cruel; but the boy paid no attention. Suddenly the\\nhorse turned, seized his tormentor by the shoulder, and pushed him into the\\ncanal. The water was not deep, and the boy, after floundering about for a few\\nseconds, came out dripping with mud and filth, and sat down on the tow path, and\\nlooked at the horse with such a comical expression, that the Riverdale boy had\\nto stuff his handkerchief in his mouth to keep from laughing.\\n\\n\\\"It is to be hoped that he would learn a lesson,\\\" said the president, \\\"and be\\nkinder to his horse in the future. Now, Bernard Howe, your story.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy was a brother to the little girl who had told the monkey story, and he,\\ntoo, had evidently been talking to his grandfather. He told two stories, and\\nMiss Laura listened eagerly, for they were about Fairport.\\n\\nThe boy said that when his grandfather was young, he lived in Fairport, Maine.\\nOn a certain day he stood in the market square to see their first stage-coach\\nput together. It had come from Boston in pieces, for there was no one in\\nFairport that could make one. The coach went away up into the country one day,\\nand came back the next. For a long time no one understood driving the horses\\nproperly, and they came in day after day with the blood streaming from them. The\\nwhiffletree would swing round and hit them, and when their collars were taken\\noff, their necks would be raw and bloody. After a time, the men got to\\nunderstand how to drive a coach, and the horses did not suffer so much.\\n\\nThe other story was about a team-boat, not a steamboat. More than seventy years\\nago, they had no steamers running between Fairport and the island opposite where\\npeople went for the summer, but they had what they called a team-boat, that is,\\na boat with machinery to make it go, that could be worked by horses. There were\\neight horses that went around and around, and made the boat go. One afternoon,\\ntwo dancing masters, who were wicked fellows, that played the fiddle, and never\\nwent to church on Sundays, got on the boat, and sat just where the horses had to\\npass them as they went around.\\n\\nEvery time the horses went by, they jabbed them with their penknives. The man\\nwho was driving the horses at last saw the blood dripping from them, and the\\ndancing masters were found out. Some young men on the boat were so angry that\\nthey caught up a rope's end, and gave the dancing masters a lashing, and then\\nthrew them into the water and made them swim to the island.\\n\\nWhen this boy took a seat, a young girl read some verses that she had clipped\\nfrom a newspaper:\\n\\n\\\"Don't kill the toads, the ugly toads,\\n\\nThat hop around your door;\\n\\nEach meal the little toad doth eat  A hundred bugs or more.\\n\\n\\\"He sits around with aspect meek,\\n\\nUntil the bug hath neared,\\n\\nThen shoots he forth his little tongue\\n\\nLike lightning double-geared.\\n\\n\\\"And then he soberly doth wink,\\n\\nAnd shut his ugly mug,\\n\\nAnd patiently doth wait until\\n\\nThere comes another bug.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Maxwell told a good dog story after this. He said the president need not\\nhave any fears as to its truth, for it had happened in his boarding house in the\\nvillage, and he had seen it himself. Monday, the day before, being wash-day, his\\nlandlady lady had put out a large washing. Among the clothes on the line was a\\ngray flannel shirt belonging to her husband. The young dog belonging to the\\nhouse had pulled the shirt from the line and torn it to pieces. The woman put it\\naside and told him master would beat him. When the man came home to his dinner,\\nhe showed the dog the pieces of the shirt, and gave him a severe whipping. The\\ndog ran away, visited all the clothes lines in the village, till he found a gray\\nshirt very like his master's. He seized it and ran home, laying it at his\\nmaster's; feet, joyfully wagging his tail meanwhile\\n\\nMr. Maxwell's story done, a bright-faced boy, called Simon Grey, got up and\\nsaid, \\\"You all know our old gray horse Ned. Last week father sold him to a man\\nin Hoytville, and I went to the station when he was shipped. He was put in a box\\ncar. The doors were left a little open to give him air, and were locked in that\\nway. There was a narrow, sliding door, four feet from the floor of the car, and,\\nin some way or other, old Ned pushed this door open, crawled through it, and\\ntumbled out on the ground. When I was coming from school, I saw him walking\\nalong the track. He hadn't hurt himself, except for a few cuts. He was glad to\\nsee me, and followed me home. He must have gotten off the train when it was\\ngoing full speed, for he hadn't been seen at any of the stations, and the\\ntrainmen were astonished to find the doors locked and the car empty, when they\\ngot to Hoytville. Father got the man who bought him to release him from his\\nbargain, for he says if Ned is so fond of Riverdale, he shall stay here.\\\"\\n\\nThe president asked the boys and girls to give three cheers for old Ned, and\\nthen they had some more singing. After all had taken their seats, he said he\\nwould like to know what the members had been doing for animals during the past\\nfortnight.\\n\\nOne girl had kept her brother from shooting two owls that came about their\\nbarnyard. She told him that the owls would destroy the rats and mice that\\nbothered him in the barn, but if he hunted them, they would go to the woods.\\n\\nA boy said that he had persuaded some of his friends who were going fishing, to\\nput their bait worms into a dish of boiling water to kill them before they\\nstarted, and also to promise him that as soon as they took their fish out of the\\nwater, they would kill them by a sharp blow on the back of the head. They were\\nall the more ready to do this, when he told them that their fish would taste\\nbetter when cooked, if they had been killed as soon as they were taken from the\\nwater into the air.\\n\\nA little girl had gotten her mother to say that she would never again put\\nlobsters into cold water and slowly boil them to death. She had also stopped a\\nman in the street who was carrying a pair of fowls with their heads down, and\\nasked him if he would kindly reverse their position. The man told her that the\\nfowls didn't mind, and she pursed up her small mouth and showed the band how she\\nsaid to him, \\\"I would prefer the opinion of the hens.\\\" Then she said he had\\nlaughed at her, and said, \\\"Certainly, little lady,\\\" and had gone off carrying\\nthem as she wanted him to. She had also reasoned with different boys outside the\\nvillage who were throwing stones at birds and frogs, and sticking butterflies,\\nand had invited them to come to the Band of Mercy.\\n\\nThis child seemed to have done more than any one else for dumb animals. She had\\ntaken around a petition to the village boys, asking them not to search for\\nbirds' eggs, and she had even gone into her father's stable, and asked him to\\nhold her up, so that she could look into the horses' mouths to see if their\\nteeth wanted filing or were decayed. When her father laughed at her, she told\\nhim that horses often suffer terrible pain from their teeth, and that sometimes\\na runaway is caused by a metal bit striking against the exposed nerve in the\\ntooth of a horse that has become almost frantic with pain.\\n\\nShe was a very gentle girl, and I think by the way that she spoke that her\\nfather loved her dearly, for she told how much trouble he had taken to make some\\ntiny houses for her that she wanted for the wrens that came about their farm,\\nShe told him that those little birds are so good at catching insects that they\\nought to give all their time to it, and not have any worry about making houses.\\nHer father made their homes very small, so that the English sparrows could not\\nget in and crowd them out.\\n\\nA boy said that he had gotten a pot of paint, and painted in large letters on\\nthe fences around his father's farm: \\\"Spare the toads, don't kill the birds.\\nEvery bird killed is a loss to the country.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That reminds me,\\\" said the president, \\\"to ask the girls what they have done\\nabout the millinery business.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have told my mother,\\\" said a tall, serious faced girl, \\\"that I think it is\\nwrong to wear bird feathers, and she has promised to give up wearing any of them\\nexcept ostrich plumes.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Wood asked permission to say a few words just here, and the president said:\\n\\\"Certainly, we are always glad to hear from you.\\\"\\n\\nShe went up on the platform, and faced the roomful of children. \\\"Dear boys and\\ngirls,\\\" she began, \\\"I have had some papers sent me from Boston, giving some\\nfacts about the killing of our birds, and I want to state a few of them to you:\\nYou all know that nearly every tree and plant that grows swarms with insect\\nlife, and that they couldn't grow if the birds didn't eat the insects that would\\ndevour their foliage. All day long, the little beaks of the birds are busy. The\\ndear little rose-breasted gross-beak carefully examines the potato plants, and\\npicks off the beetles, the martins destroy weevil, the quail and grouse family\\neats the chinchbug, the woodpeckers dig the worms from the trees, and many other\\nbirds eat the flies and gnats and mosquitoes that torment us so. No flying or\\ncrawling creature escapes their sharp little eyes. A great Frenchman says that\\nif it weren't for the birds human beings would perish from the face of the\\nearth. They are doing all this for us, and how are we rewarding them? All over\\nAmerica they are hunted and killed. Five million birds must be caught every year\\nfor American women to wear in their hats and bonnets. Just think of it, girls.\\nIsn't it dreadful? Five million innocent, hard-working, beautiful birds killed,\\nthat thoughtless girls and women may ornament themselves with their little dead\\nbodies. One million bobolinks have been killed in one month near Philadelphia.\\nSeventy song-birds were sent from one Long Island village to New York milliners.\\n\\n\\\"In Florida, cruel men shoot the mother bird. on their nests while they are\\nrearing their young. because their plumage is prettiest at that time. The little\\nones cry pitifully, and starve to death. Every bird of the rarer kinds that is\\nkilled, such as humming birds, orioles and kingfishers, means the death of\\nseveral others that is, the young that starve to death, the wounded that fly\\naway to die, and those whose plumage is so torn that it is not fit to put in a\\nfine lady's bonnet. In some cases where birds have gay wings, and the hunters do\\nnot wish the rest of the body, they tear off the wings from the living bird, and\\nthrow it away to die.\\n\\n\\\"I am sorry to tell you such painful things, but I think you ought to know them.\\nYou will soon be men and women. Do what you can to stop this horrid trade. Our\\nbeautiful birds are being taken from us, and the insect pests are increasing.\\nThe State of Massachusetts has lost over one hundred thousand dollars because it\\ndid not protect its birds. The gypsy moth stripped the trees near Boston, and\\nthe State had to pay out all this money, and even then could not get rid of the\\nmoths. The birds could have done it better than the State, but they were all\\ngone. My last words to you are, ' Protect the birds.'\\\" Mrs. Wood went to her\\nseat, and though the boys and girls had listened very attentively, none of them\\ncheered her. Their faces looked sad, and they kept very quiet for a few minutes.\\nI saw one or two little girls wiping their eyes. I think they felt sorry for the\\nbirds.\\n\\n\\\"Has any boy done anything about blinders and check-reins?\\\" asked the president,\\nafter a time.\\n\\nA brown-faced boy stood up. \\\"I had a picnic last Monday,\\\" he said; \\\"father let\\nme cut all the blinders off our head-stalls with my penknife.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did you get him to consent to that?\\\" asked the president.\\n\\n\\\"I told him,\\\" said the boy, \\\"that I couldn't get to sleep for thinking of him.\\nYou know he drives a good deal late at night. I told him that every dark night\\nhe came from Sudbury I thought of the deep ditch alongside the road, and wished\\nhis horses hadn't blinders on. And every night he comes from the Junction, and\\nhas to drive along the river bank where the water has washed away the earth till\\nthe wheels of the wagon are within a foot or two of the edge, I wished again\\nthat his horses could see each side of them, for I knew they'd have sense enough\\nto keep out of danger if they could see it. Father said that might be very true,\\nand yet his horses had been broken in with blinders, and didn't I think they\\nwould be inclined to shy if he took them off; and wouldn't they be frightened to\\nlook around and see the wagon wheels so near. I told him that for every accident\\nthat happened to a horse without blinders, several happened to a horse with\\nthem; and then I gave him Mr. Wood's opinion Mr. Wood out at Dingley Farm. He\\nsays that the worst thing against blinders is that a frightened horse never\\nknows when he has passed the thing that scared him. He always thinks it is\\nbehind him. The blinders are there and he can't see that he has passed it, and\\nhe can't turn his head to have a good look at it. So often he goes tearing madly\\non; and sometimes lives are lost all on account of a little bit of leather\\nfastened over a beautiful eye that ought to look out full and free at the world.\\nThat finished father. He said he'd take off his blinders, and if he had an\\naccident, he'd send the bill for damages to Mr. Wood. But we've had no accident.\\nThe horses did act rather queerly at first, and started a little; but they soon\\ngot over it, and now they go as steady without blinders as they ever did with\\nthem.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy sat down, and the president said: \\\"I think it is time that the whole\\nnation threw off this foolishness of half covering their horses' eyes. Just put\\nyour hands up to your eyes, members of the band. Half cover them, and see how\\nshut in you will feel; and how curious you will be to know what is going on\\nbeside you. Suppose a girl saw a mouse with her eyes half covered, wouldn't she\\nrun?\\\"\\n\\nEverybody laughed, and the president asked some one to tell him who invented\\nblinders.\\n\\n\\\"An English nobleman,\\\" shouted a boy, \\\"who had a wall-eyed horse! He wanted to\\ncover up the defect, and I think it is a great shame that all the American\\nhorses have to suffer because that English one had an ugly eye.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So do I,\\\" said the president. \\\"Three groans for blinders, boys.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the children in the room made three dreadful noises away down in their\\nthroats. Then they had another good laugh, and the president became sober again.\\n\\\"Seven more minutes,\\\" he said; \\\"this meeting has got to be let out at five\\nsharp.\\\"\\n\\nA tall girl at the back of the room rose, and said: \\\"My little cousin has two\\nstories that she would like to tell the band.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well,\\\" said the president; \\\"bring her right along.\\\"\\n\\nThe big girl came forward, leading a tiny child that she placed in front of the\\nboys and girls. The child stared up into her cousin's face, turning and twisting\\nher white pinafore through her fingers. Every time the big girl took her\\npinafore away from her, she picked it up again. \\\"Begin, Nannie,\\\" said the big\\ngirl, kindly.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Cousin Eleanor,\\\" said the child, \\\"you know Topsy, Graham's pony. Well,\\nTopsy would run away, and a big, big man came out to papa and said he would\\ntrain Topsy. So he drove her every day, and beat her, and beat her, till he was\\ntired, but still Topsy would run away. Then papa said he would not have the poor\\npony whipped so much, and he took her out a piece of bread every day, and he\\npetted her and now Topsy is very gentle, and never runs away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell about Tiger,\\\" said the girl.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Cousin Eleanor,\\\" said the child, \\\"you know Tiger, our big dog. He used to\\nbe a bad dog, and when Dr. Fairchild drove up to the house he jumped up and bit\\nat him. Dr. Fairchild used to speak kindly to him, and throw out bits of meat,\\nand now when he comes, Tiger follows behind and wags his tail. Now, give me a\\nkiss.\\\"\\n\\nThe girl had to give her a kiss, right up there before every one, and what a\\nstamping the boys made. The larger girl blushed and hurried back to her seat,\\nwith the child clinging to her hand.\\n\\nThere was one more story, about a brave Newfoundland dog, that saved eight lives\\nby swimming out to a wrecked sailing vessel, and getting a rope by which the men\\ncame ashore, and then a lad got up whom they all greeted with cheers, and cries\\nof, \\\"The Poet! the Poet!\\\" I didn't know what they meant, till Mrs. Wood\\nwhispered to Miss Laura that he was a boy who made rhymes, and the children had\\nrather hear him. speak than any one else in the room.\\n\\nHe had a snub nose and freckles, and I think he was the plainest boy there, but\\nthat didn't matter, if the other children loved him. He sauntered up to the\\nfront, with his hands behind his back, and a very grand manner.\\n\\n\\\"The beautiful poetry recited here to-day,\\\" he drawled, \\\"put some verses in my\\nmind that I never had till I came here to-day.\\\" Every one present cheered\\nwildly, and he began in a sing song voice:\\n\\n\\\"I am a Band of Mercy boy,\\n\\nI would not hurt a fly,\\n\\nI always speak to dogs and cats,\\n\\nWhen'er I pass them by.\\n\\n\\\"I always let the birdies sing,\\n\\nI never throw a stone,\\n\\nI always give a hungry dog\\n\\nA nice, fat, meaty bone.\\n\\nI wouldn't drive a bob-tailed horse,\\n\\nNor hurry up a cow,\\n\\nI \\\"\\n\\nThen he forgot the rest. The boys and girls ,were so sorry. They called out,\\n\\\"Pig,\\\" \\\"Goat,\\\" \\\"Calf,\\\" \\\"Sheep,\\\" \\\"Hens,\\\" \\\"Ducks,\\\" and all the other animals'\\nnames they could think of, but none of them was right, and as the boy had just\\nmade up the poetry, no one knew what the next could be. He stood for a long time\\nstaring at the ceiling, then he said, \\\"I guess I'll have to give it up.\\\"\\n\\nThe children looked dreadfully disappointed. \\\"Perhaps you will remember it by\\nour next meeting,\\\" said the president, anxiously.\\n\\n\\\"Possibly, said the boy, \\\"but probably not. I think it is gone forever.\\\" And he\\nwent to his seat.\\n\\nThe next thing was to call for new members. Miss Laura got up and said she would\\nlike to join their Band of Mercy. I followed her up to the platform, while they\\npinned a little badge on her, and every one laughed at me. Then they sang, \\\"God\\nBless our Native Land,\\\" and the president told us that we might all go home.\\n\\nIt seemed to me a lovely thing for those children to meet together to talk about\\nkindness to animals. They all had bright and good faces, and many of them\\nstopped to pat me as I came out. One little girl gave me a biscuit from her\\nschool bag.\\n\\nMrs. Wood waited at the door till Mr. Maxwell came limping out on his crutches.\\nShe introduced him to Miss Laura, and asked him if he wouldn't go and take tea\\nwith them. He said he would be very happy to do so, and then Mrs. Wood laughed;\\nand asked him if he hadn't better empty his pockets first. She didn't want a\\nlittle toad jumping over her tea table, as one did the last time he was there.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXI  MR. MAXWELL AND MR. HARRY\\n\\nMR. MAXWELL wore a coat with loose pockets, and while she was speaking, he\\nrested on his crutches, and began to slap them with his hands. \\\"No; there's\\nnothing here to-day,\\\" he said; \\\"I think I emptied my pockets before I went to\\nthe meeting.\\\"\\n\\nJust as he said that there was a loud squeal: \\\"Oh, my guinea pig,\\\" he exclaimed;\\n\\\"I forgot him,\\\" and he pulled out a little spotted creature a few inches long.\\n\\\"Poor Derry, did I hurt you?\\\" and he soothed it very tenderly.\\n\\nI stood and looked at Mr. Maxwell, for I had never seen any one like him. He had\\nthick curly hair and a white face, and he looked just like a girl. While I was\\nstaring at him, something peeped up out of one of his pockets and ran out its\\ntongue at me so fast that I could scarcely see it, and then drew back again. I\\nwas thunderstruck. I had never seen such a creature before. It was long and thin\\nlike a boy's cane, and of a bright green color like grass, and it had queer\\nshiny eyes. But its tongue was the strangest part of it. It came and went like\\nlightning. I was uneasy about it, and began to bark.\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter, Joe?\\\" said Mrs. Wood; \\\"the pig won't hurt you.\\\"\\n\\nBut it wasn't the pig I was afraid of, and I kept on barking. And all the time\\nthat strange live thing kept sticking up its head and putting out its tongue at\\nme, and neither of them noticed it.\\n\\n\\\"It's getting on toward six,\\\" said Mrs. Wood; \\\"we must be going home. Come, Mr.\\nMaxwell.\\\"\\n\\nThe young man put the guinea pig in his pocket, picked up his crutches, and we\\nstarted down the sunny village street. He left his guinea pig at his boarding\\nhouse as he went by, but he said nothing about the other creature, so I knew he\\ndid not know it was there.\\n\\nI was very much taken with Mr. Maxwell. He seemed so bright and happy, in spite\\nof his lameness, which kept him from running about like other young men. He\\nlooked a little older than Miss Laura, and one day, a week or two later, when\\nthey were sitting on the veranda, I heard him tell her that he was just\\nnineteen. He told her, too, that his lameness made him love animals. They never\\nlaughed at him, or slighted him, or got impatient, because he could not walk\\nquickly. They were always good to him, and he said he loved all animals while he\\nliked very few people.\\n\\nOn this day as he was limping along, he said to Mrs. Wood: \\\"I am getting more\\nabsent-minded every day. Have you heard of my latest escapade?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I am glad,\\\" he replied. \\\"I was afraid that it would be all over the village by\\nthis time. I went to church last Sunday with my poor guinea pig in my pocket. He\\nhasn't been well, and I was attending to him before church, and put him in there\\nto get warm, and forgot about him. Unfortunately I was late, and the back seats\\nwere all full, so I had to sit farther up than I usually do. During the first\\nhymn I happened to strike Piggy against the side of the seat. Such an ear-\\nsplitting squeal as he set up. It sounded as if I was murdering him. The people\\nstared and stared, and I had to leave the church, overwhelmed with confusion.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Wood and Miss Laura laughed, and then they got talking about other matters\\nthat were not interesting to me, so I did not listen. But I kept close to Miss\\nLaura, for I was afraid that green thing might hurt her. I wondered very much\\nwhat its name was. I don't think I should have feared it so much if I had known\\nwhat it was.\\n\\n\\\"There's something the matter with Joe,\\\" said Miss Laura, when we got into the\\nlane. \\\"What is it, dear old fellow?\\\" She put down her little hand, and I licked\\nit, and wished so much that I could speak.\\n\\nSometimes I wish very much that I had the gift of speech, and then at other\\ntimes I see how little it would profit me, and how many foolish things I should\\noften say. And I don't believe human beings would love animals as well, if they\\ncould speak.\\n\\nWhen we reached the house, we got a joyful surprise. There was a trunk standing\\non the veranda, and as soon as Mrs. Wood saw it, she gave a little shriek: \\\"My\\ndear boy!\\\"\\n\\nMr. Harry was there, sure enough, and stepped out through the open door. He took\\nhis mother in his arms and kissed her, then he shook hands with Miss Laura and\\nMr. Maxwell, who seemed to be an old friend of his. They all sat down on the\\nveranda and talked, and I lay at Miss Laura's feet and looked at Mr. Harry. He\\nwas such a handsome young man, and had such a noble face. He was older and\\ngraver looking than when I saw him last, and he had a light, brown mustache that\\nhe did not have when he was in Fairport.\\n\\nHe seemed very fond of his mother and of Miss Laura, and however grave his face\\nmight be when he was looking at Mr. Maxwell, it always lighted up when he turned\\nto them. \\\"What dog is that?\\\" he said at last, with a puzzled face, and pointing\\nto me.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Harry,\\\" exclaimed Miss Laura, \\\"don't you know Beautiful Joe, that you\\nrescued from that wretched milkman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it possible,\\\" he said, \\\"that this well-conditioned creature is the bundle of\\ndirty skin and bones that we nursed in Fairport? Come here, sir. Do you remember\\nme?\\\"\\n\\nIndeed I did remember him, and I licked his hands and looked up gratefully into\\nhis face. \\\"You're almost handsome now,\\\" he said, caressing me with a firm, kind\\nhand, \\\"and of a solid build, too. You look like a fighter but I suppose you\\nwouldn't let him fight, even if he wanted to, Laura,\\\" and he smiled and glanced\",\"timestamp\":1640141013,\"title\":\"\\nThree or four boys jumped up, but the president said they would take one at a \"},\"digest\":\"u0IbwbfvSlHq2_T5U0nUlQyonpOfrWEtPDCL_6TEVYw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x755Bda80E984cd5fAabcbf90e065196EEDb3214A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yy0yaMhcLwtctjAC6W7NulQRCleZncSoLm-2tlhc_bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CSDxvq2cg6_USrXsv2ajHul8b5sATvdjz5gK2X7qwOg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zLmhWmkJ7cIr3EZEXKMVEIHK_D1SLNLXE-NXM01jlh4NeTEeEuxk4uoJoG4w867potvdMkxBDoADdCnE2FVPUA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd93ec80d0714ce5e1fb275d7c3e29df78ed95b718a6885b7cc7efe22f13049c86973ef2bc6575f2e5e82adbfd9dbfaf8536aaec71b46c08bd0bed1c5885575441c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yy0yaMhcLwtctjAC6W7NulQRCleZncSoLm-2tlhc_bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CSDxvq2cg6_USrXsv2ajHul8b5sATvdjz5gK2X7qwOg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u0IbwbfvSlHq2_T5U0nUlQyonpOfrWEtPDCL_6TEVYw\"}"
