"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"IN the midst of a garden grew a rose-tree, in full blossom, and in\\n\\nthe prettiest of all the roses lived an elf. He was such a little\\n\\nwee thing, that no human eye could see him. Behind each leaf of the\\n\\nrose he had a sleeping chamber. He was as well formed and as beautiful\\n\\nas a little child could be, and had wings that reached from his\\n\\nshoulders to his feet. Oh, what sweet fragrance there was in his\\n\\nchambers! and how clean and beautiful were the walls! for they were\\n\\nthe blushing leaves of the rose.\\n\\n```\\nDuring the whole day he enjoyed himself in the warm sunshine, flew\\n```\\n\\nfrom flower to flower, and danced on the wings of the flying\\n\\nbutterflies. Then he took it into his head to measure how many steps\\n\\nhe would have to go through the roads and cross-roads that are on\\n\\nthe leaf of a linden-tree. What we call the veins on a leaf, he took\\n\\nfor roads; ay, and very long roads they were for him; for before he\\n\\nhad half finished his task, the sun went down: he had commenced his\\n\\nwork too late. It became very cold, the dew fell, and the wind blew;\\n\\nso he thought the best thing he could do would be to return home. He\\n\\nhurried himself as much as he could; but he found the roses all closed\\n\\nup, and he could not get in; not a single rose stood open. The poor\\n\\nlittle elf was very much frightened. He had never before been out at\\n\\nnight, but had always slumbered secretly behind the warm\\n\\nrose-leaves. Oh, this would certainly be his death. At the other end\\n\\nof the garden, he knew there was an arbor, overgrown with beautiful\\n\\nhoney-suckles. The blossoms looked like large painted horns; and he\\n\\nthought to himself, he would go and sleep in one of these till the\\n\\nmorning. He flew thither; but \\\"hush!\\\" two people were in the arbor,- a\\n\\nhandsome young man and a beautiful lady. They sat side by side, and\\n\\nwished that they might never be obliged to part. They loved each other\\n\\nmuch more than the best child can love its father and mother.\",\"timestamp\":1636531307,\"title\":\"    FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\\n\"},\"digest\":\"imORDjxJvEGsPNksdwSJIJQVsM2Zqf78RbXmsxBCiSc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8918151a07B96D518Ab70C61e4091FfA62e25A17\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Hob8e5SwRtRNd_slEgq4xVYRZKNpxk4NVqHBrQi-qX979ELfTOrwMOoRZx0OmUIxw5sMVvBdq5A9OaIj0sdP_g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1d0070b3d71460522c9fef6c88b79f7074cfae0e0c715cda41e6999a0d02a29b705fd62c19372523f43bbe911bd30f899c0a56dfaaf5bbac2c28b1ba4e1878171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"imORDjxJvEGsPNksdwSJIJQVsM2Zqf78RbXmsxBCiSc\"}"
