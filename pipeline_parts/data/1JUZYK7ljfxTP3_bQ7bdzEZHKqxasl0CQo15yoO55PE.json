"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"What was the most interesting thought you had last week?   Was it an idea for a Netflix show?  An observation about how children learn?  A prediction for the future of web3?\\n\\nRight now, whenever you have an interesting thought you likely don’t write it down and you definitely don’t post it to social media.  Maybe you tell a friend or colleague, but you likely just forget the thought altogether.\\n\\nWe each produce [6,000](https://www.newsweek.com/humans-6000-thoughts-every-day-1517963) thoughts every day and we’ve become accustomed to dismissing them.  We’ve been trained to think our thoughts don’t matter because the way the world works today they usually don’t.  Unless you’re one of a select few there’s really no way for you to share your thoughts with the world that gives them a shot at making an impact on our collective consciousness.  I think this is a hidden problem that’s holding humanity back and I think it’s solvable.\\n\\nI believe the key to solving this problem is to build [a new type of network](https://mirror.xyz/bficho.eth/MZqOaHtK_N6tCeX7XrZbV6CfQD7uCV8uW3W_Gr7DnpM) that works differently than a social network. Chaos is an intelligence network designed to find and spread the best thinking in the world.  It operates as a meritocracy of ideas where the best thinking wins distribution irregardless of the source.\\n\\nIf you want to contribute to this new intelligence network the first thing you need to do to is start capturing your interesting thoughts using Chaos.  This is a [powerful and transformative habit](https://ideapod.com/6-surprising-benefits-writing-thoughts-feelings/) that you should work to build.  After you capture a thought, you’ll have two options, you can save it to your private graph or Stream it to the public graph.\\n\\nThe public graph contains all the thoughts added to our collective consciousness grouped into Streams.  Streams are collections of thoughts based on a category.  Each Stream comes with unique features to explore and engage with each collection and the people that are focused on that line of thinking.\\n\\nIn the beginning Chaos will only have a few broad Streams, but as more people join the network and new categories start to emerge Streams will expand in breadth and depth.  Each Stream is being designed to progress innovation and our collective knowledge as quickly and efficiently as possible by finding all the people in the world that can contribute useful thinking to that topic and integrating AI that helps facilitate thinking.\\n\\nEverything comes together for you in your feed, which will match you up with the Streams & thoughts we think will be most interesting, relevant, or otherwise inspiring to you.  The goal is to continuously find the thinking that inspires you to think.  You can think of Chaos as a tool that helps maximize the number of new and interesting thoughts your mind generates.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iS-ZT-L6Dhlk7IYhT7HLA.png?height=1508&width=3008)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FPowv8oIV2mcUZziV9jmZ.png?height=1341&width=3655)\\n\\nIf we get this right it will lead to an explosion of new ideas as Chaos becomes a perpetual knowledge generation machine in the same way TikTok has become a perpetual video generation machine\\n\\nIf this is something that you want to be a part of, you can request access to the private beta [here](https://chaosai.typeform.com/to/n2C2aAxF)!\\n\\n\\\\- Brian Ficho @[bficho](https://www.twitter.com/bficho), Founder, Chaos\",\"timestamp\":1641178926,\"title\":\"How to Build a Perpetual Knowledge Generation Machine\"},\"digest\":\"2L5S_RqffpAYFUBb8idqofecux4YeJt4X-btceaYb-w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8b9532bD0d02EEc6D18eED6fCC651a85Ed9825a1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1Ls3sa6DDzajyKTli7_SoRbBtu7n437PLSa4RD_Ls1w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ilXkYyGIf_5WwqH_A4prxTOSnQJ2j5wZ_00AnLNVB6c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7PLnEeuzuW8VNzxK3Dh8UIN5bf5z9Ps6X2v_2x-MHN6y_rDHenB-dIl7HLUycDrGZV4PsCBigBAGTAOYgrVwFg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0b9d3f3132c63bf20c18779a896302f355225ed375b09893e376ae25faeafdb0412712d79a71840c4889b9d959f2a3ec33593a9f94e246e467c261d875b7cb431b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1Ls3sa6DDzajyKTli7_SoRbBtu7n437PLSa4RD_Ls1w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ilXkYyGIf_5WwqH_A4prxTOSnQJ2j5wZ_00AnLNVB6c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VGqcT009ru_48wRFmn6YrapKThDDMix_jfbgnhdiWS0\"}"
