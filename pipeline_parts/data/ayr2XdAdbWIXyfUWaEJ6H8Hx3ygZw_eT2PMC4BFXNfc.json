[ + apply here + ](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-UNI-Grants-6e3e84967a984a5fb127ae749649ddc9)\\n\\ni've worked on [design & animation](https://vimeo.com/chrismartz) projects for tv, film, tech and now do a mix of freelance web3 work, design and research\\n\\ni make art and recently i've been making NFTs on [Zora](https://martz.mirror.xyz/IuJ1MpoYggEK1XkyLTuEsHpHMQaYjK0EERlQhUYT2W0), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/martz) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/chrismartz)\\n\\n [NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/26184)\\n\\n\\n\\nyou can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chrismartz)  and sometimes on discord in [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/)\\n\\ni recently applied for a [Uniswap grant](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d) via their online form - on a whim, and somehow they liked my proposal\\n\\nshoutout to [FWB](https://fwb.help/Manifesto) especially the #rough-drafts channel, massive thanks to [Trevor](https://twitter.com/whatdotcd) and FWB staff\\n\\n[Jose Mejia](https://twitter.com/JoseRMejia), [Panther Modern](https://twitter.com/panthermodern__) and [Callil Capuozzo](https://twitter.com/_callil) for guidance and feedback on the process\\n\\nshoutout to [Ken Ng](https://twitter.com/nkennethk) from [Uniswap Grants](https://twitter.com/uniswapgrants) for mentoring me, guiding me and encouraging me to try something new.\\n\\n[Apply Here](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-UNI-Grants-6e3e84967a984a5fb127ae749649ddc9) ü¶Ñ üí´\\n\\nthe grant's focus is on usability -

soft launch a mirror.xyz community publishing channel for Uniswap on mirror\\n\\n> - create a place for community members to get a spotlight and get paid for their creative works\\n\\n> - make governance fun and interesting\\n\\nright now, much of this process is active research but we will be building prototypes soon, here is very rough mockup\\n\\nUniversal Editions / Clout Universe / _TBD_ \\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bd350e7-0f5a-4d52-9319-1a3f28ae5172.png?height=1566&width=1096)\\n\\n\\n\\nthe concept is that curators get to vote in a [write race](https://mirror.xyz/race) type format but for their own publications or posts, the process is entirely open to the public\\n\\nThere is a time period (once a week?) between post reviews and authors are encouraged to submite whatever they want.\\n\\nperhaps for simplicity, it would feel as easy as writing a blog on medium or posting photos, or even just a tweetstorm\\n\\nit would be very cool to have independent teams work to create these and be able to use [splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) to divide up the bounty\\n\\nit would be equally cool if this sort of module could help us build the updated community hub / blog for Uniswap\\n\\ni've seen on FWB and via Uniswap Airdop how incentives can really work, especially when paired with creative work\\n\\nif somewhat successful, other crypto ecosystems seeking community could spin up their own community hubs using this mirror block / module.\\n\\nI am seeing lots of parallels to this with the work zora is doing here with *Auction House*\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1392491120937086979?s=20\\n\\n\\nas a designer and a researcher i've noticed a lot of potential and a ton of available funding in this space, i think a good spend of this could be more experiments\\n\\nones that reach people who may not understand the basics of crypto at all, or may be scared to explore a realm that feels \\\"sketchy\\\" or unfamiliar to them\\n\\nif you like this idea, or have any feedback (or have a good name for the publication thing) -
