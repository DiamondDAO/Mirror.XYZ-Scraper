"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello there! Just posting a status on here to see if I can influence some motivation in myself to write up some short stories.\\n\\nPlease do note that I know I need to go over the work for grammar mistakes/punctuation errors.\\n\\nAll through-out time, the power of words have shown their power; whether that be through arbitrary means of manipulation or even through the power of influence. What would we humans be without the ability to converse, to share ideas, to influence others through thought? Would we just act based on primal instinct and give into a more simple primal alchemical stage with smidgens of creativity? Would we still act as our own gods and put into praxis inventions from the ether?\\n\\nWould it not be fair and exact to say that in most conscious people's lives, they have seen energy channelled and morphed, whether that is by outside accausal means or through an enforcement and a causal approach with the control of will. How many experiences of coincidences throughout our lives would the individual attribute towards being \\\"too coincidental\\\" How very often do people share these experiences, become psychic associates and completely ignore the fresh meaty smell floating in front of their face to give the notion that \\\"all is not quite right\\\"  or that \\\"there is a bigger picture left to be unfolded\\\"\\n\\nWe live in an era where the numinous effect that words give us have been completely ignored and treated as poppycock and thus we are to be deemed as crazy for associating thought, feeling and coincidences with specific words by the common cattle.\\n\\n## \",\"timestamp\":1641438846,\"title\":\"Start of creepy philosophy...\"},\"digest\":\"akEpmzZ9QMLPoBeidCcLnPX8HI1JIyFk27IG5VPTbgo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8461797faB8DB3d7b1934d307452Fab3f0c4Cf64\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YiP04qB12NW1jTejmRE_drBs6bl-PH9dIL1GW8tImmg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Mm1zRtEpnJIXZ1ZwuM6LTjpqn2kcmGC_uC0xcnVmT0A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rXENkS5zmQqO7VFQU1jZZHLdldtQqJJBmla6UA0LgAdhGXvxfPlB5ECEKoyr9UDt3RDyR6hU34C0mPwE1H0UxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0d3cf838c53f816492e84af2883b002f9536ed7450612a94ecc21b90d50bc88717320e104c25c44560a2c3336083243e563d541962a8717449673eee4f9809bc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YiP04qB12NW1jTejmRE_drBs6bl-PH9dIL1GW8tImmg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Mm1zRtEpnJIXZ1ZwuM6LTjpqn2kcmGC_uC0xcnVmT0A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"akEpmzZ9QMLPoBeidCcLnPX8HI1JIyFk27IG5VPTbgo\"}"
