"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"laid side by side with a heavy glass top with bevelled edges and the medal and pipe lying on a white satin bed, bound down with silver--and a large gold plate with the inscription \\\"To Richard Harding Davis with the warmest greetings from Gregory Brewster--1895\\\"-- You have no idea how pretty it is, Bailey, Banks and Biddle made it-- It is just like him to do anything so sweet and thoughtful and it has attracted so many people that I have had it locked up-- No Burden jewel robbers here-- My friend, the Russian O---- lady still pursues me and as she has no sense of humor and takes everything seriously, she frightens me-- I am afraid she will move in at any moment-- She has asked me to spend the summer with her at Paris and Monte Carlo, and at her country place in Norfolk and bombards me with invitations to suppers and things in the meantime.  She has just sent me a picture of herself two feet by three, with writing all over it and at any moment, I expect her to ring the bell and order her trunks taken up stairs-- I am too attractive-- Last night I dined with Helen and Maude Adams, who is staying with her.  I want them to board me too.  Maude sang for us after dinner and then went off to see Yvette Guilbert at a \\\"sacred concert\\\" to study her methods.  I went to N----'s box to hear Melba and we chatted to the accompaniment of Melba, Nordica and Plancon in a trio--the Ogre, wore fur, pearls, white satin and violets.  It was a pink silk box.  Then I went down to a reception at Mrs. De Koven's and found it was a play.  Everybody was seated already so I squatted down on the floor in front of Mrs. De Koven and a tall woman in a brocade gown cut like a Japanese woman's-- It was very dark where the audience was, so I could not see her face but when the pantomime was over I looked up and saw it was Yvette Guilbert.  So I grabbed Mrs. De Koven and told her to present me and Guilbert said in English-- \\\"It is not comfortable on the floor is it?\\\" and I said, \\\"I have been at your feet for three years now, so I am quite used to it\\\"--for which I was much applauded-- Afterwards I told some one to tell her in French that I had written a book about Paris and about her and that I was going to mark it and send it and before the woman could translate, Guilbert said, \\\"No, send me the Van Bippere book\\\"-- So we asked her what she meant and she said, \\\" M. Bourget told me to meet you and to read your Van Bippere Book, you are Mr. Davis, are you not?\\\"-- So after that I owned the place and refused to meet Mrs. Vanderbilt.\\n\\nYvette has offered to teach me French, so I guess I won't go to Somerset's wedding, unless O---- scares me out of the country.  I got my $2,000 check and have paid all my debts.  They were not a third as much as I thought they were, so that's all right.\\n\\nDo come over mother, as soon as you can and we will meet at Jersey City, and have a nice lunch and a good talk.  Give my bestest love to Dad and Nora.  How would she like Yvette for a sister-in-law?  John Hare has sent me seats for to night-- He is very nice-- I have begun the story of the \\\"Servants' Ball\\\" and got well into it.\\n\\nand lots of love.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nThe following letter was written to me at Florence.  The novel referred to was \\\"Soldiers of Fortune,\\\" which eventually proved the most successful book, commercially, my brother ever wrote.  Mrs. Hicks, to whom Richard frequently refers, is the well-known English actress Ellaline Terriss, the wife of Seymour Hicks.  Somerset is Somers Somerset, the son of Lady Henry Somerset, and the Frohman referred to is Daniel Frohman, who was the manager of the old Lyceum Theatre.\\n\\nEarly in November, William R. Hearst asked my brother to write a description of the Yale-Princeton football game for The Journal.  Richard did not want to write the \\\"story\\\" and by way of a polite refusal said he could not undertake it for less than $500.00.  Greatly to his surprise Hearst promptly accepted the offer.  At the time, I imagine this was by far the largest sum ever paid a writer for reporting a single event.\\n\\nDecember 31st, 1895. New York. The Players.\\n\\nNew Year's Eve. DEAR CHAS:\\n\\nI am not much of a letter writer these days, but I have finished the novel and that must make up for it.  It goes to the Scribners for $5,000 which is not as much as I think I should have got for it.  I am now lying around here until the first of February, when I expect to sail to Somerset's wedding, reaching you in little old Firenzi in March.  We will then paint it.  After that I do not know what I shall do.  The Journal is after me to do almost anything I want at my own figure, as a correspondent.  They have made Ralph London correspondent and their paper is the only one now to stick to.  They are trying to get all the well known men at big prices.\\n\\nI have had such a good time helping Mrs. Hicks in Seymour's absence.  She had about everything happen to her that is possible and she is just the sort of little person you love to do things for.  She finally sailed and I am now able to attend to my own family.\\n\\nThe Central American and Venezuelan book comes out on February lst.  Several of the papers here jokingly alluded to the fact that my article on the Venezuelan boundary had inspired the President's message.  Of course you get garbled ideas of things over there and exaggerated ones, as for instance, on the Coxey army.  But you never saw anything like the country after that war message. It was like living with a British fleet off Sandy Hook.  Everybody talked of it and of nothing else.  I went to a dinner of 300 men all of different callings and I do not believe one of them spoke of anything else.  Cabmen, car conductors, barkeepers, beggars and policemen.  All talked war and Venezuela and the Doctrine of Mr. Monroe.  In three days the country lost one thousand of millions of dollars in values, which gives you an idea how expensive war is.  It is worse than running a newspaper.  Now, almost everyone is for peace, peace at any price.  I do not know of but one jingo paper, The Sun, and war talk is greeted with jeers.  It was as if the people had suddenly had their eyes opened to what it really meant and having seen were wiser and wanted no more of it.  Your brother, personally, looks at it like this.  Salisbury was to blame in the first place for being rude and not offering to arbitrate as he had been asked to do.  When he said to Cleveland, \\\"It's none of your business\\\" the only answer was \\\"Well, I'll make it my business\\\" but instead of stopping there, Cleveland uttered a cast iron ultimatum instead of leaving a loophole for diplomacy and a chance for either or both to back out.  That's where I blame him as does every one else.\\n\\nSam Sothern is in Chicago and we all wrote him guying letters about the war.  Helen said she was going to engage \\\"The Heart of Maryland\\\" company to protect her front yard, while Russell and I have engaged \\\"The Girl I Left Behind Me\\\" company with Blanch Walsh and the original cast.\\n\\nWe sent Somerset a picture of himself riddled with bullets.  And Mrs. Hicks made herself famous by asking if it was that odious Dunraven they were going to war about.\\n\\nMy article was a very lucky thing and is greatly quoted and in social gatherings I am appealed to as a final authority.\\n\\nThe football story, by the way, did me a heap of good with the newspapers and the price was quoted as the highest ever paid for a piece of reporting.  People sent for it so that the edition was exhausted.  The Journal people were greatly pleased.\\n\\nYvette Guilbert is at Hammerstein's and crowds the new music hall nightly, at two dollars a seat.  Irving and Miss Terry have been most friendly to me and to the family.  Frohman is going to put \\\"Zenda\\\" on in New York because he has played a failure, which will of course kill it for next year for Eddie, when he comes out as a star.  I have never seen such general indignation over a private affair.  Barrymore called it a case of Ollaga Zenda.  They even went to Brooklyn when Eddie was playing there and asked him to stage the play for them and how he made his changes and put on his whiskers.  Poor Eddie, he lacks a business head and a business manager--and Sam talks and shakes his head but is little better.  Lots of love and best wishes for the New Year.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nMOSCOW, BUDAPEST, LONDON\\n\\nThe years 1896--1897 were probably the most active of Richard's very active life.  In the space of twelve months he reported the Coronation at Moscow, the Millennial Celebration at Budapest, the Spanish-Cuban War, the McKinley Inauguration, the Greek-Turkish War and the Queen's Jubilee.  Although this required a great deal of time spent in travelling, Richard still found opportunity to do considerable work on his novel \\\"Captain Macklin,\\\" to which he refers in one of his letters from London.\\n\\nAs correspondent of the New York American, then The Journal, Richard went from Florence, where he was visiting me, to Moscow.  He was accompanied by Augustus Trowbridge, an old friend of my brother's and a rarely good linguist.  The latter qualification proved of the greatest possible assistance to Richard in his efforts to witness the actual coronation ceremony.  To have finally been admitted to the Kremlin my brother always regarded as one of his greatest successes as a correspondent.\\n\\nEn route--May 1896. DEAR CHAS:\\n\\nThe night is passed and with the day comes \\\"a hope\\\" but during the blackness I had \\\"a suffer\\\"-- I read until two--five hours--and then slept until five when the middle man who had slept on my shoulder all night left the train and the second one to whom Bernardi was so polite left me alone and had the porter fit me up a bed so that I slept until seven again-- Then the Guardian Angel returned for his traps and I bade him a sleepy adieu and was startled to see two soldiers standing shading their eyes in salute in the doorway and two gentlemen bowing to my kind protector with the obsequiousness of servants-- He sort of smiled back at me and walked away with the soldiers and 13 porters carrying his traps.  So I rung up the conductor and he said it was the King's Minister with his eyes sticking out of his head--the conductor's eyes--not the Minister's.  I don't know what a King's Minister is but he liked your whiskey-- I am now passing through the Austrian Tyrol which pleases me so much that I am chortling with joy-- None of the places for which my ticket call are on any map--but don't you care, I don't care-- I wish I could adequately describe last night with nothing but tunnels hours in length so that you had to have all the windows down and the room looked like a safe and full of tobacco smoke and damp spongey smoke from the engine, and bad air.  That first compartment I went in was filled later with German women who took off their skirts and the men took off their shoes.  Everybody in the rear of the car is filthy dirty but I had a wash at the Custom house and now I am almost clean and quite happy.  The day is beautiful and the compartment is all my own-- I am absolutely enchanted with the Tyrol-- I have never seen such quaint picture book houses and mills with wheels like that in the Good for Nothing and crucifixes wonderfully carved and snow mountains and dark green forests-- The sky is perfect and the air is filled with the sun and the train moves so smoothly that I can see little blue flowers, baby blue, Bavarian blue flowers, in the Spring grass.  Such dear old castles like birds nests and such homelike old mills and red-faced millers with feathers in their caps you never saw out of a comic opera-- The man in here with me now is a Russian, of course, and saw the last Coronation and knows that my suite is on the principal Street and attends to my changing money and getting an omelette-- I can survive another night now having had an omelette not so good as Madam Masi's but still an omelette-- I have now left Munich and the Russian and a conductor whom I mistook for a hereditary prince of Bavaria, with tassels down his back, has assured me he is going to Berlin, and that I am going to Berlin and much else to which I smile knowingly and say mucho gracia, wee wee, ya ya, ich ich limmer and other long speeches ending with \\\"an er--\\\"\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nMay 15th, 1896.  Moscow. DEAR CHAS:\\n\\nWe left Berlin Monday night at eleven and slept well in a wagon-lit.  That was the only night out of the five that I spent in the cars that I had my clothes off, although I was able to stretch out on the seats, so I am cramped and tired now.  At seven Monday morning the guard woke us and told us to get ready for the Custom House and I looked out and saw a melancholy country of green hills and black pines and with no sign of human life.  It was raining and dreary looking and then I saw as we passed them a line of posts painted in black and white stripes a half mile apart on each side of the train and I knew we had crossed the boundary and that the line of posts stretched from the Arctic Ocean to the Black Sea and from the Pacific to the Caucasus Mountains and the Pamirs.  It gave me a great thrill but I have had so many to-day, that I had almost forgotten that one.  For two days we jogged along through a level country with meanthatched huts and black crows flying continually and peasants in sheepskin coats, full in the skirt and tight at the waist, with boots or thongs of leather around their feet.  The women wore boots too and all the men who were not soldiers had their hair cropped short like mops.  We could not find any one who understood any language, so as we never knew when we would stop for food, we ate at every station and I am of the opinion that for months I have been living on hot tea and caviar and hash sandwiches.  The snow fell an inch deep on Wednesday and dried up again in an hour and the sun shone through it all.  So on the whole it was a good trip and most interesting.  But here we are now in a perfect pandemonium and the Czar has not yet come nor one-fifth even of the notables.  It is a great city, immense and overpowering in its extent.  The houses are ugly low storied and in hideous colors except the churches which are like mosques and painted every color.  I confess I feel beaten to night by the noise and rush and roar and by so many strange figures and marvellous costumes.  Our rooms are perfect that is one thing and the situation is the very best.  If the main street were Fifth Avenue and Madison Square the Governor's Square, his palace would be Delmonico's and our rooms would be the corner rooms of the Brunswick, so you can see how well we are placed.  We can sit in our windows and look down and up the main street and see every one who leaves or calls upon the Governor.  We are now going out for a dinner and to one of many cafe-chantants and I will tell you the rest to-morrow, when I get sleep, for after five nights of it I feel done up, but I feel equally sure it is going to be a great experience and I cannot tell you how glad 1 am that I came.  Love to you all and to dear Florence in which Trowbridge, who is a brick, joins me.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nMoscow--May 1896. DEAR CHAS:\\n\\nThere was a great deal to tell when I shut down last night, but I thought I would have had things settled by this time and waited, but it looks now as though there was to be no rest for the weary until the Czar has put his crown on his head.  The situation is this: there are ninety correspondents, and twelve are to get into the coronation, two of these will be Americans.  There are five trying for it.\\n\\nCount Daschoff, the Minister of the Court, has the say as to who gets in of those five.  T. and I called on him with my credentials just as he was going out.  Never have I seen such a swell.  He made us feel like dudes from Paterson, New Jersey.  He had three diamond eagles in an astrakan cap, a white cloak, a gray uniform, top boots and three rows of medals.  He spoke English perfectly, with the most politely insolent manner that I have ever had to listen to; and eight servants, each of whom we had, in turn, mistaken for a prince royal, bowed at him all the brief time he talked over our heads.  He sent us to the bureau for correspondents, where they gave me a badge and a pocketbook, with my photo in it.  They are good for nothing, except to get through the police lines.  No one at the bureau gave us the least encouragement as to my getting in at the coronation.  We were frantic, and I went back to Breckenridge, our Minister, and wrote him a long letter explaining what had happened, and that what I wrote would \\\"live,\\\" that I was advertised and had been advertised to write this story for months.  I dropped The Journal altogether, and begged him to represent me as a literary light of the finest color.  This he did in a very strong letter to Daschoff, and I presented it this morning, but the Minister, like Edison, said he would let me know when he could see me.  Then I wrote Breck a letter of thanks so elegant and complimentary that he answered with another, saying if his first failed he would try again.  That means he is for me, and at the bureau they say whichever one he insists on will get in, but they also say he is so good-natured that he helps every one who comes.  I told him this, and he has promised to continue in my behalf as soon as we hear from Daschoff.\\n\\nThe second thing of importance is the getting the story, IF WE GET IT, on the wire.  That, I am happy to say, we are as assured of as I could hope to be.  I own the head of the Telegraph Bureau soul, body and mind.  He loves the ground T. and I spurn, and he sent out my first cable today, one of interrogation merely, ahead of twelve others; he has also given us the entree to a private door to his office, all the other correspondents having to go to the press-rooms and undergo a sort of press censorship, which entails on each man the cutting up of his story into three parts, so as to give all a chance.  I gave T. three dictums to guide him; the first was that we did not want a fair chance--we wanted an unfair advantage over every one else.  Second, to never accept a \\\"No\\\" or a \\\"Yes\\\" from a subordinate, but to take everything from head-quarters.  Third, to use every mouse, and not to trust to the lions.  He had practise on the train.  When he told me we would be in Moscow in ten hours, I would say, \\\"Who told you that,\\\" and back he would go to the Herr Station Director in a red gown, and return to say that we would get there in twenty hours.  By this time I will match him against any newspaper correspondent on earth.  He flatters, lies, threatens and bribes with a skill and assurance that is simply beautiful, and his languages and his manners pull me out of holes from which I could never have risen.  With it all he is as modest as can be, and says I am the greatest diplomat out of office, which I really think he believes, but I am only using old reporters' ways and applying the things other men did first.\\n\\nMy best stroke was to add to my cable to The Journal, \\\"Recommend ample recognition of special facilities afforded by telegraph official\\\"--and then get him to read it himself under the pretext of wishing to learn if my writing was legible.  He grinned all over himself, and said it was.  After my first story is gone I will give him 200 roubles for himself in an envelope and say Journal wired me to do it.  That will fix him for the coronation story, as it amounts to six months' wages about.  But, my dear brother, in your sweet and lovely home, where the sun shines on the Cascine and the workmen sleep on the bridges, and dear old ladies knit in the streets, that is only one of the thousand things we have had to do.  It would take years to give you an account of what we have done and why we do it.  It is like a game of whist and poker combined and we bluff on two flimsy fours, and crawl the next minute to a man that holds a measly two-spot.  There is not a wire we have not pulled, or a leg, either, and we go dashing about all day in a bath-chair, with a driver in a bell hat and a blue nightgown, leaving cards and writing notes and giving drinks and having secretaries to lunch and buying flowers for wives and cigar boxes for husbands, and threatening the Minister with Cleveland's name.\\n\\nJohn A. Logan, Jr., is coming dressed in a Russian Uniform, and he wore it on the steamer, and says he is the special guest of the Czar and the Secretary of the visiting mission.  Mrs. P. P. is paying $10,000 for a hotel for one week.  That is all the gossip there is.  We lunched with the McCooks today and enjoyed hearing American spoken, and they were apparently very glad to have us, and made much of T. and of me. We only hope they can help us; and I am telling the General the only man to meet is Daschoff, and when he does I will tell him to tell Daschoff I am the only man to be allowed in the coronation.  I wish I could tell you about the city, but we see it only out of the corner of our eyes as we dash to bureau after bureau and \\\"excellency\\\" and \\\"royal highness\\\" people, and then dash off to strengthen other bridges and make new friends.  It is great fun, and I am very happy and T. is having the time of his life.  He told me he would rather be with me on this trip than travel with the German Emperor, and you will enjoy to hear that he wrote Sarah I was the most \\\"good-natured\\\" man he ever met.  God bless you all, and dear, dear Florence.  Lots of love.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nMoscow--May, 1896. DEAR CHAS:\\n\\nI have just sent off my coronation story, and the strain of this thing, which has really been on me for six months, is off.  You can imagine what a relief it is, or, rather, you cannot, for no one who has not been with us these last ten days can know what we have had to do.  The story I sent is not a good one.  It was impossible to tell it by cable, and the first one on the entry was a much better one.  I do not care much, though; of course, I do care, as I ought to have made a great hit with it, but there was no time, and there was so much detail and minutia that I could not treat it right.  However, after the awful possibility, or rather certainty, that we have had to face of not getting any story at all, I am only too thankful.  I would not do it again for ten thousand dollars.  Edwin Arnold, who did it for The Telegraph, had  $25,000, and if I told you of the way Hearst acted and Ralph interfered with impertinent cables, you would wonder I am sane.  They never sent me a cent for the cables until it was so late that I could not get it out of the bank, and we have spent and borrowed every penny we have.  Imagine having to write a story and to fight to be allowed a chance to write it, and at the same time to be pressed for money for expenses and tolls so that you were worn out by that alone.  The brightest side of the whole thing was the way everybody in this town was fighting for me.  The entire town took sides, and even men who disliked me, and who I certainly dislike, like C. W. and R---- of the Paris Embassy, turned in and fought for my getting in like relations.  And the women--I had grand dukes and ambassadors and princes, whom I do not know by sight, moving every lever, and as Stanhope of The Herald, testified \\\"every man, woman and child in the visiting and resident legation is crazy on the subject of getting Davis into the coronation.\\\"  They made it a personal matter, and when I got my little blue badge, the women kissed me and each other, and cheered, and the men came to congratulate me, and acted exactly as though they had got it themselves.\\n\\nIt was a beautiful sight; the Czarina much more beautiful and more sad-looking than ever before.  But it was not solemn enough, and the priests groaned and wailed and chanted and sang, and every one stood still and listened.  All that the Czar and Czarina did was over ten minutes after they entered the chapel, and then for three hours the priests took the center of the stage and groaned.  I was there from seven until one.  Six solid hours standing and writing on my hat.  It was a fine hat, for we were in court costume, I being a distinguished visitor, as well as a correspondent.  That was another thing that annoyed me, because Breckinridge, who has acted like a brick, did not think he could put me on both lists, so I chose the correspondents' list, of course, in hopes of seeing the ceremony, but knowing all the time that that meant no balls or functions, so that had I lost the ceremony I would have had nothing; but he arranged it so that I am on both lists.  Not that I care now.  For I am tired to death; and Trowbridge did not get on either list, thanks to the damned Journal and to his using all his friends to help me, so that I guess I will get out and go to Buda Pest and meet you in Paris.  Do not consider this too seriously, for I am writing it just after finishing my cable and having spent the morning on my toes in the chapel.  I will feel better tomorrow.  Anyway, it is done and I am glad, as it was the sight of the century, and I was in it, and now I can spend my good time and money in gay Paree.  Love to all.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nFrom Moscow Richard went direct to Buda Pest, where he wrote an article on the Hungarian Millennial.\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/96](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/96)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639125770,\"title\":\"\\nWhat do you think Sir Henry sent me?
