"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*This essay was published on [Forefront](https://forefront.news/blog/feat-shreyas-physical-digital-world). It is summarized below.*\\n\\nCrypto is partly a resistance to the decline in ownership. Home and car ownership have declined. Digital goods are rented on platforms. Software is licensed via subscriptions. But you actually own the private keys to your crypto. That opens up a universe of internet-native assets that you can own and control. These include digital art, media, online communities, video game collectibles, and many other things we haven't created yet.\\n\\nThese are some of the interesting experiments on digital ownership: \\n- [Cryptomedia](https://cryptomedia.wtf/)\\n- Unique digital experiences like the [Metapalooza event](https://andrewsteinwold.substack.com/p/-metapalooza-making-history-with)\\n- Communities built around NFTs like [WHALE](https://forefront.news/creators/whale)\\n- [Crowdfunding](https://dev.mirror.xyz/llJ_AboiDJwB_ZAFz-CXU7fL2p8v5Wz6MjfluLafewQ) writing via NFTs\\n- Incorporating status games into cryptonetworks via NFTs\\n\\nThere are two problems today. First, token IDs are scarce but the [metadata isn't](https://outpost-protocol.com/jamm/post/lbH2RrWaSHjBAVRg40vJJ5T00sZtwIWsmKA3Jg2flis). Second, metaverse experiences are low-fidelity today. We should be able to integrate more of our body, senses, and physical world with computing.\\n\\nIn the future, it is possible that the metaverse becomes so engaging and entertaining that it distracts us from important things in the physical world.\\n\\n> \\\"Instead of violent wars, there could be violent video games; instead of heroic feats, there could be thrilling amusement park rides; instead of serious thought, there could be 'intrigues of all sorts', as in a soap opera. It is a world where people spend their lives amusing themselves to death.\\\" - Peter Thiel.\\n\\nOver the next few years, people will be able to truly own more digital assets. Creators and communities will be able to capture more of the value that they create. We will build out various components of the metaverse and hopefully ensure that the digital goods and experiences we create are interoperable between platforms.\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1611850915,\"title\":\"Asset Light in the Physical World.
