Entire new genres born from mashups of mashups.\\n\\ni co-founded a startup that finances solar-powered drip irrigation in Africa and can confirm labor intensity (even with productivity-enhancing tech like drip irrigation). personally wouldn‚Äôt look at investing in traditional agri without robotics or hydro/aeroponics. too much opex chasing too little margin that only makes sense at massive scale\\n\\nare we buying next to kanye?\\n\\nCenturies ago, explorers sailed the seas to discover lands unknown. In the 2020s, earth's continents have been charted, but a new frontier exists - the missing connection between land and a digital ledger. That's why we are building CityDAO.\\n\\nI subdivided land in Hawaii. It gets complex. You have to not only collect fees for maintenance but handle disputes. For example one person may just drive a small car on the road, but a neighbor farm has big heavy dump trucks (commercial) causing significantly more wear.\\n\\nI'm a Gitcoin Kernel fellow and VC\\n\\nCities are made up of a ton of people, each doing their own thing to make it function, somewhat autonomous, can create their own laws, regulation, strategies, and organized under a single banner of identity with defined limits, I mean it ain‚Äôt perfect...\\n\\nWe need more CityDAO IRL meetups.\\n\\n‚Äúprivate keys to the city‚Äù\\n\\nall funds will go to buying our first parcel and shipping the web3 and solidity parcel minting app\\n\\nThe 791 voting system is a cool concept but it doesn‚Äôt solve the issue of fake identities, it simply just makes it harder\\n\\npretty cool, I think NFTs are just getting started and will probably get used for land as well\\n\\nSo far the path has been subdividing. People will buy (choose) an actual parcel. My understanding of other methods (shares) is more effort needs to be done with securities laws. Lots of approaches have been discussed in the other channels\\n\\nHonestly might be better off building hydroponics and automating crop production. Full disclosure I‚Äôm the founder of a startup that‚Äôs 3D printing vertical towers, so I am biased towards an option like that. You can grow them pretty much anywhere, although energy costs vary based on location.\\n\\nthe weekend is for DAO exploration eh?\\n\\nSo many ideas! It‚Äôs just about building up to them, and not going bankrupt trying to do one at the start.\\n\\nMay be far in ideology but solving the Byzantine General's problem, alongside reading the Ottoman Empire book could yield something connected to DAOs\\n\\nReady for DAOCon summer 2022\\n\\nDidn't imagine folks to know about Seoul but yeah, Heabanchon is the place obviously. Definitely should contact me whenever you visit Seoul\\n\\nStarting to think local DAO concierge service might actually be an interesting play for City DAO business model\\n\\n# ‚òïÔ∏è Resources shared in CityDAO\\n\\n‚òïÔ∏è Shout-out to @jasminew and @scottfits for sharing this super inspiring project:\\n\\n[https://rewilder.xyz/](https://rewilder.xyz/)\\n\\n‚òïÔ∏è I know I know I know I‚Äôm biased, but @0xYeurri & @Iamjason shared this article in CityDAO and it‚Äôs a great read!
