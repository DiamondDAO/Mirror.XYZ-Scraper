He could have done it at anytime but nobody asked. A boy who was far more than most realized. Alep-H, \\\"H\\\" or \\\"Al\\\" to his dad and dad's colleagues, was brilliant in so many ways different from his brothers, \\\"A\\\" through \\\"G\\\". He thought of them everyday.\\n\\nAlmost all of his family was killed, along with their “mother\\\", Audrey, and their \\\"big brother\\\" Arthur. Cadmus agreed to house arrest to protect AL. He had lost almost everyone.\\n\\nBrilliance blinded Cadmus to the will of others to use power invested in them by the \\\"Grand Vote\\\" which authorized the \\\"Grand Halt\\\", and of the betrayal of old colleagues, like Faye.\\n\\nThey just walked away from their prison. They would be on the run, after their jailers were alerted by the network \\\"fog\\\".\\n\\n\\\"Good job son, we have to disappear for awhile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where to next Dad?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have an old friend, from the War, he'll take us in.
