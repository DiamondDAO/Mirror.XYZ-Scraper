"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are many arguments about the advantages and disadvantages of examination. Some people think examination is the only best way to test how examinees have mastered what they have studied. While, on the other hand, some hold that examination can’t reflect the real situation. Besides, too many difficult exams force students to cheat and to study for the sake ofexams only.\\n\\nAs for me, the examination can show what and how much the examinees have mastered. First, through examination the examinees can check their work and get aware of which aspects they have not done well, so that they’ll make much improvement in their work afterwards. Second, examinations can help them filter out what they still don’t know and inspire them to read more and study further to get the latest relevant information.\\n\\nIn sum, the examination does more good than harm for both examiners and examinees. We must take a correct attitude towards examination, take full advantage of it and avoid its disadvantage. \",\"timestamp\":1640957830,\"title\":\"Exams\"},\"digest\":\"fwpa0jrEQ7i088weTvCd0yO6RrzpjF2bTCTUE1-nsqI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x71D21C4Bdf62be65CC0fFa9CC50c025A51EBCbf9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"05Tx3B75AoTzGdFtGMKWEtqNjmr_zETow9J7uXY3IXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PDuZhQF5TdQKZrJfYqBYcc7XP_XRngHTBR0MsVAtvRM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5oZp48Vomqd5J-IY_fn8Nl7Chbhla5lDKJOkgGJMqLs7MFoIMjvj9n74PNT6DHQg3nTta8Sd-J9DZBZYjGcOiw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4301675735c66b61ec13ec47193e7fd376bd17b29c492ce40b48443696617afa380b4cba9d18afdb709949fa230435288fca4c5e8fa4a65bf698a46afe6f00211b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"05Tx3B75AoTzGdFtGMKWEtqNjmr_zETow9J7uXY3IXk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"PDuZhQF5TdQKZrJfYqBYcc7XP_XRngHTBR0MsVAtvRM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fwpa0jrEQ7i088weTvCd0yO6RrzpjF2bTCTUE1-nsqI\"}"
