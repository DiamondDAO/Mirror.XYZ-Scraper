"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I wanna know what life is\\n\\nI have no idea what a real life feels like. Still settling in a shabby tiny room I rent right in the Captial of this country, living a life of untidiness and chaos.\\n\\nI watched Hartisuuu’s video online, I saw his room stuffed with bottles and cigarette butts, I saw him randomly digging his hand in sundries looking for cookware and yet happened to fetch out things from his university. I heard him mentioning his past of being a chef in a hotel and now living among trash feeling nothing but only numb.\\n\\nGo sleep if you feel sleepy. Find something to eat if you feel hungry,\\n\\nYoung people would rather hodl his nfts on opensea than pay off his debt. Crypto punks, apes and cool cats are showing off their confidence and robustness of being the new rich against traditional finance, while Opensea itself keeps telling people we’re gonna do an IPO. DAOs, one after another, pump out like never before. Posers, speculationists, idealists and metaphysicists are rushing into Daos for different purposes and doing their contributions towards a perfect self governed community. Even playing games has become a way of gig economy, giving SE Asians infinite hopes towards a promising monetization future.\\n\\nTraditional industries are gradually fading out, while crypto fields are taking on their blazing radiance. In a real life winter accompanied by omicron and delta, crypto world is vibrant and lively like a everlasing spring. Happily and hopefully, we usher into 2022.\\n\\nThe 2022 New Year is no different from that of 2021. One or another city is in lockdown, and there’re always some people who cannot go back to their homes.\\n\\nNo matter what, web3 is always blooming. One blocked another, unbelievably high gas, no way for the poor to join the carnival, it doesn’t really matter. Web3 is forever vitalized. PoS has changed production relations forever, and web3 stays permissionless anyway. Taking a firm stand in decentralization on one hand, and building up identity and reputation systems such as DID on another. How whole as a person you act and are perceived in reality, it has to be completely the same in crypto. While stepping into the metaverse, you keep in mind that ENS and NFT is your medal of honor demonstrating your glorious achievements and pride as an OG. New comers take it as pride in making their significant decision to taking up crypto as their lifelong career.\\n\\nI have no idea what real life feels like. I still live in a shabby rent room.\\n\\ngo sleep if i feel sleepy, go eat if I feel hungry.\\n\\nMy collegue wants buy the new lego. My friend said he was tired and wants to have a massage. Another friend wants to go to have a warm bath, and the other thinks pretty hard on have to invest and make money. I was thinking something else, like spending another 15u to upgrade keycaps, like when I receive my delivery.\\n\\nMy friends are getting married one by one. My ex just got cheated by his gf and broke his heart. Some are worried about not earning enough money, some others are depressed because no one really loves him/her. The one I used to playing video games together has now in prison, while another one blocked everyone for nothing.\\n\\nSome complaint to me about shitty stuffs at work, telling me how exhaustive or restrictive it is. Others envy their stable income and jobs. I reflect on myself and find I have no future. Neither do I have savings, nor any skills to support myself.\\n\\nI follow many people on Cyberconnect, and some of them followed back. I saw their boards filled with colorful and expensive nfts and poaps. I felt Vitalik’s ens address was so close within a single click on web3. Then I go back to youtube to watch the messy kitchen tutorial videos by Hartisuuu, and videos of Indian street foods.\\n\\nRight at that moment, mom sent me pics of adorable kitties at home, talking about my real families and their work and life.\\n\\nReal fams, I mean.\\n\\nIt’s 2022, man. As usual, I have nothing, and still have no idea of what life is.\\n\\n我想知道什么是生活\\n\\n我不知道真正的生活是什么样子的。我仍然在破破烂烂的小出租屋，过着不收拾屋子的生活。\\n\\n我在油管看到hartisuuu的邋遢厨房，我看到满窗台的酒瓶和烟头，自己介绍会翻出来大学的东西，会说自己以前是酒店的厨师，但是现在就算在垃圾堆屋子里睡觉吃饭也没什么感觉。\\n\\n困了就睡觉，饿了就搞点吃的。\\n\\n年轻人宁愿还不上信用卡，也舍不得卖掉自己opensea上的nft。opensea上的crypto punk像英雄一样展示着新晋资本和年轻反对传统的自信，但opensea本身却跃跃欲试一次又一次告诉大家我要上市。一个又一个DAO雨后春笋一样涌现出来，dao里的装逼人和投机主义者、形而上人和理想主义者鱼龙混杂，连打游戏也能算是web3里的劳工经济，链游成了东南亚人翻身做主人千载难逢的机会。世界经济摇摇欲坠，传统行业式微日渐，加密货币百花齐放。在现实里从未度过的疫情寒冬里，虚拟世界里元宇宙焕发蓬勃生机，欢天喜地迎来了2022年。\\n\\n2022年的新年与2021也没有太大不同，总有一个城市在封城，仍然有人春节不能返乡。\\n\\n但是web3.0仍然欣欣向荣，你屏蔽我，我屏蔽你，手续费窜上天，穷人连入门的机会都没有，并没有太大影响，PoS改变了生产关系，web3永远permissionless，永远开放。一边去中心化，一边建立起身份系统、声誉系统，在现实里多么whole person，在链上就要更完整。进入元宇宙，也不忘了拿ens和nft宣称自己作为web3早鸟的占有欲和自豪感，后辈前赴后继挤破脑袋字里行间都以踏入行业为荣。\\n\\n名誉和权利，在web3比在2更重要。\\n\\n我不知道真正的生活是什么样子的。我仍然在破破烂烂的小出租屋，过着不收拾屋子的生活。\\n\\n困了就睡觉，饿了就搞点吃的。\\n\\n同事有人想买新款乐高，有人觉得累了想去按摩，有人圣诞想去泡温泉，有人苦苦思索怎么投资，我在纠结要不要花90块买一套键帽。我焦急地等待快递发货。\\n\\n我的朋友有人快要结婚了，以前的恋人刚刚失恋了，有人每天苦恼赚钱，有人发愁没有人爱她，曾经一起打游戏的人有的人入狱了，有的人把所有人都拉黑了。\\n\\n以前的同事大老远约我吃饭，比我还小但是长了很多白头发，跟我说工作很消耗人，以前的室友跟我说工作不自由，其实是说出去都会引以为豪的体制内好岗位。旱的旱死涝的涝死。我反思了一下自己，我只是没有未来。没有任何有价值的库存，没有任何得以傍身的技能。\\n\\n我在cyberconnect关注与回关，看到其他人主页挂满poap勋章，看到他们nft墙上满满当当，然后我在油管看到hartisuuu的邋遢厨房，看刘墉干净又卫生，微信弹出来爸爸妈妈给我发抱着小猫的照片，辛辛苦苦上班的照片。\\n\\n2022年了，我还是一无所有，我不知道真正的生活是什么样子的。\",\"timestamp\":1641972515,\"title\":\"I wanna know what life is\"},\"digest\":\"63c_ML3h8z0sbcBrTD4EHz5ojHqhG8OLuQW-x6iVodA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x637e5b007d9EEae686e0f19f05a8E5B8e2Afd4d5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h_wMzLcFa0M0n6McSh_SBSsupLYGFJjri2neKoANZ0o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xOp-qJ0cDHRz95iXAPmPwn2SuHC1n5_sfxfpKy5NSuo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kzRRvmSMXj29-9MQcUrL4UCQF708mUqHgLw5f9GSEcBuCrRc8nHJMs33LdntoDyfyU6iYJNY_NlziToLS4-h4A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x79fa0abcad24cf3f3e95bb735d2beef87bbc61bca3fdb585ab65c4408c9b9e5765a0bd5c725600e9b6b061036f7af7c0e17affec74ddd11c4e5bfc8d6e1d9dc01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h_wMzLcFa0M0n6McSh_SBSsupLYGFJjri2neKoANZ0o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xOp-qJ0cDHRz95iXAPmPwn2SuHC1n5_sfxfpKy5NSuo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NLwSyj7TB8YWEmVt2Ce9SQ_PpPABNvojk8cIlYDm16Y\"}"
