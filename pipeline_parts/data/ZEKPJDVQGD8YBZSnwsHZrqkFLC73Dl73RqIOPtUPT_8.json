"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Uxmoor soon followed on an old hunter. He lifted Zoe to her saddle, and away they rode, the groom following at a respectful distance.\\n\\nWhen they got on the downs they had a delightful canter; but Zoe, in her fevered state of mind, was not content with that. She kept increasing the pace, till the old hunter could no longer live with the young filly; and she galloped away from Lord Uxmoor, and made him ridiculous in the eyes of his groom.\\n\\nThe truth is, she wanted to get away from him.\\n\\nHe drew the rein, and stood stock-still. She made a circuit of a mile, and came up to him with heightened color and flashing eyes, looking beautiful.\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\" said she. \\\"Don't you like galloping?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but I don't like cruelty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Cruelty?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look at the mare's tail how it is quivering, and her flanks panting! And no wonder. You have been over twice the Derby course at a racing pace. Miss Vizard, a horse is not a steam engine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll never ride her again,\\\" said Zoe. \\\"I did not come here to be scolded. I will go home.\\\"\\n\\nThey walked slowly home in silence. Uxmoor hardly knew what to say to her; but at last he murmured, apologetically, \\\"Never mind the poor mare, if you are better for galloping her.\\\"\\n\\nShe waited a moment before she spoke, and then she said, \\\"Well, yes; I am better. I'm better for my ride, and better for my scolding. Good-by.\\\" (Meaning forever.)\\n\\n\\\"Good-by,\\\" said he, in the same tone. Only he sent the mare next day, and followed her on a young thorough-bred.\\n\\n\\\"What!\\\" said Zoe; \\\"am I to have another trial?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And another after that.\\\"\\n\\nSo this time she would only canter very slowly, and kept stopping every now and then to inquire, satirically, if that would distress the mare.\\n\\nBut Uxmoor was too good-humored to quarrel for nothing. He only laughed, and said, \\\"You are not the only lady who takes a horse for a machine.\\\"\\n\\nThese rides did her bodily health some permanent good; but their effect on her mind was fleeting. She was in fair spirits when she was actually bounding through the air, but she collapsed afterward.\\n\\nAt first, when she used to think that Severne never came near her, and Uxmoor was so constant, she almost hated Uxmoor--so little does the wrong man profit by doing the right thing for a woman. I admit that, though not a deadly woman-hater myself.\\n\\nBut by-and-by she was impartially bitter against them both; the wrong man for doing the right thing, and the right man for not doing it.\\n\\nAs the days rolled by, and Severne did not appear, her indignation and wounded pride began to mount above her love. A beautiful woman counts upon pursuit, and thinks a man less than man if he does not love her well enough to find her, though hid in the caves of ocean or the labyrinths of Bermondsey.\\n\\nShe said to herself, \\\"Then he has no explanation to offer. Another woman has frightened him away from me. I have wasted my affections on a coward.\\\" Her bosom boiled with love, and contempt, and wounded pride; and her mind was tossed to and fro like a leaf in a storm. She began, by force of will, to give Uxmoor some encouragement; only, after it she writhed and wept.\\n\\nAt last, finding herself driven to and fro like a leaf, she told Miss Maitland all, and sought counsel of her. She must have something to lean on.\\n\\nThe old lady was better by this time, and spoke kindly to her. She said Mr. Severne was charming, and she was not bound to give him up because another lady had past claims on him. But it appeared to her that Mr. Severne himself had deserted her. He had not written to her. Probably he knew something that had not yet transpired, and had steeled himself to the separation for good reasons. It was a decision she must accept. Let her then consider how forlorn is the condition of most deserted women compared with hers. Here was a devoted lover, whom she esteemed, and who could offer her a high position and an honest love. If she had a mother, that mother would almost force her to engage herself at once to Lord Uxmoor. Having no mother, the best thing she could do would be to force herself--to say some irrevocable words, and never look back. It was the lot of her sex not to marry the first love, and to be all the happier in the end for that disappointment, though at the time it always seemed eternal.\\n\\nAll this, spoken in a voice of singular kindness by one who used to be so sharp, made Zoe's tears flow gently and somewhat cooled her raging heart.\\n\\nShe began now to submit, and only cry at intervals, and let herself drift; and Uxmoor visited her every day, and she found it impossible not to esteem and regard him. Nevertheless, one afternoon, just about his time, she was seized with such an aversion to his courtship, and such a revolt against the slope she seemed gliding down, that she flung on her bonnet and shawl, and darted out of the house to escape him. She said to the servant, \\\"I am gone for a walk, if anybody calls.\\\"\\n\\nUxmoor did call, and, receiving this message, he bit his lip, sent the horse home and walked up to the windmill, on the chance of seeing her anywhere. He had already observed she was never long in one mood; and as he was always in the same mind, he thought perhaps he might be tolerably welcome, if he could meet her unexpected.\\n\\nMeantime Zoe walked very fast to get away from the house as soon as possible, and she made a round of nearly five miles, walking through two villages, and on her return lost her way. However, a shepherd showed her a bridle-road which, he told her, would soon take her to Somerville Villa, through \\\"the small pastures;\\\" and, accordingly, she came into a succession of meadows not very large. They were all fenced and gated; but the gates were only shut, not locked. This was fortunate; for they were new five-barred gates, and a lady does not like getting over these, even in solitude. Her clothes are not adapted.\\n\\nThere were sheep in some of these, cows in others, and the pastures wonderfully green and rich, being always well manured, and fed down by cattle.\\n\\nZoe's love of color was soothed by these emerald fields, dotted with white sheep and red cows.\\n\\nIn the last field, before the lane that led to the village, a single beast was grazing. Zoe took no notice of him, and walked on; but he took wonderful notice of her, and stared, then gave a disagreeable snort. He took offense at her Indian shawl, and, after pawing the ground and erecting his tail, he came straight at her at a tearing trot, and his tail out behind him.\\n\\nZoe saw, and screamed violently, and ran for the gate ahead, which, of course, was a few yards further from her than the gate behind. She ran for her life; but the bull, when he saw that, broke into a gallop directly, and came up fast with her. She could not escape.\\n\\nAt that moment a man vaulted clean over the gate, tore a pitchfork out of a heap of dung that luckily stood in the corner, and boldly confronted the raging bull just in time; for at that moment Zoe lost heart, and crouched, screaming, in the side ditch, with her hands before her eyes.\\n\\nThe new-comer, rash as his conduct seemed, was country-bred and knew what he was about: he drove one of the prongs clean through the great cartilage of the bull's mouth, and was knocked down like a nine-pin, with the broken staff of the pitch-fork in his hand; and the bull reared in the air with agony, the prong having gone clean through his upper lip in two places, and fastened itself, as one fastens a pin, in that leathery but sensitive organ.\\n\\nNow Uxmoor was a university athlete; he was no sooner down than up. So, when the bull came down from his rearing, and turned to massacre his assailant, he was behind him, and seizing his tail, twisted it, and delivered a thundering blow on his backbone, and followed it up by a shower of them on his ribs. \\\"Run to the gate, Zoe!\\\" he roared. Whack! whack! whack!--\\\"Run to the gate, I tell you!\\\"--whack!--whack!--whack!--whack!--whack!\\n\\nThus ordered, Zoe Vizard, who would not have moved of herself, being in a collapse of fear, scudded to the gate, got on the right side of it, and looked over, with two eyes like saucers. She saw a sight incredible to her. Instead of letting the bull alone, now she was safe, Uxmoor was sticking to him like a ferret. The bull ran, tossing his nose with pain and bellowing: Uxmoor dragged by the tail and compelled to follow in preposterous, giant strides, barely touching the ground with the point of his toe, pounded the creature's ribs with such blows as Zoe had never dreamed possible. They sounded like flail on wooden floor, and each blow was accompanied with a loud jubilant shout. Presently, being a five's player, and ambidexter, he shifted his hand, and the tremendous whacks resounded on the bull's left side. The bull, thus belabored, and resounding like the big drum, made a circuit of the field, but found it all too hot: he knew his way to a certain quiet farmyard; he bolted, and came bang at Zoe once more, with furious eyes and gore-distilling nostrils.\\n\\nBut this time she was on the right side of the gate.\\n\\nYet she drew back in dismay as the bull drew near: and she was right; for, in his agony and amazement, the unwieldy but sinewy brute leaped the five-barred gate, and cleared it all but the top rail; that he burst through, as if it had been paper, and dragged Uxmoor after him, and pulled him down, and tore him some yards along the hard road on his back, and bumped his head against a stone, and so got rid of him: then pounded away down the lane, snorting, and bellowing, and bleeding; the prong still stuck through his nostrils like a pin.\\n\\nZoe ran to Uxmoor with looks of alarm and tender concern, and lifted his head to her tender bosom; for his clothes were torn, and his cheeks and hands bleeding. But he soon shook off his confusion, and rose without assistance.\\n\\n\\\"Have you got over your fright?\\\" said he; \\\"that is the question.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes! yes! It is only you I am alarmed for. It is much better I should be killed than you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Killed! I never had better fun in my life. It was glorious. I stuck to him, and hit--there, I have not had anything I could hit as hard as I wanted to, since I used to fight with my cousin Jack at Eton. Oh, Miss Vizard, it was a whirl of Elysium! But I am sorry you were frightened. Let me take you home.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes, but not that way; that is the way the monster went!\\\" quivered Zoe.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, he has had enough of us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I have had too much of him. Take me some other road--a hundred miles round. How I tremble!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So you do. Take my arm.--No, putting the tips of your fingers on it is no use; take it really--you want support. Be courageous, now--we are very near home.\\\"\\n\\nZoe trembled, and cried a little, to conclude the incident, but walked bravely home on Uxmoor's arm.\\n\\nIn the hall at Somerville Villa she saw him change color, and insisted on his taking some port wine.\\n\\n\\\"I shall be very glad,\\\" said he.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/123](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/123)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637671506,\"title\":\"\\nNext day came Phillis, saddled. and led by a groom on horseback, \"},\"digest\":\"VBtC48TQk3SSKc_iDRrOEnOfblnSp8ipVVX-8aPbo-k\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa216D8906Acd104a8EC6a31f93e945DFe15768c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"153sWLbrj0fviTb-Dj67-4PQZy2b5y9MImd-lHCi_Lk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_jgtX1jtPnllj-5cGOq7_BqsLXBemp-77tPJWfmKJzo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K2orWvEd6UZy-2WRIparZJ7U9eIHqLHWW4D8N-ST-De3rnMwnrC2s7O6YNraJbuyu9xjIZS4UvYBwrr0RB0P8w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x70914f8b4461d0ab5b21b09a3c09f8e02b311ce1c1d4a66ac8c84b7f5c5f731571dfa6b275858d44f4e8ef9dd27ca37ff7be350580d7c1f0c3d183152de33f881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"153sWLbrj0fviTb-Dj67-4PQZy2b5y9MImd-lHCi_Lk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_jgtX1jtPnllj-5cGOq7_BqsLXBemp-77tPJWfmKJzo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VBtC48TQk3SSKc_iDRrOEnOfblnSp8ipVVX-8aPbo-k\"}"
