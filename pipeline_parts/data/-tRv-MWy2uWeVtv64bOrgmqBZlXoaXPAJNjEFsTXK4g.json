"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I had my sketch-book with me, and made a drawing of Liverpool from the other side of the river.  Close to Birkenhead were some excellent bits of scenery, old and picturesque farmhouses, overshadowed with venerable oaks, with juttings-out of the New Red Sandstone rocks, covered with heather, furze, and broom, with pools of water edged with all manner of effective water plants.  They formed capital subjects for the artistic pencil, especially when distant peeps of the Welsh hills came into the prospect.  I made several sketches, and they kept company with my graphic memoranda of architectural and mechanical objects.  I may here mention that on my return to London I showed them to my brother Patrick, and some of them so much met his fancy that he borrowed my sketch-book and painted some pictures from them, which at this day are hanging on the walls of some of his admirers.\\n\\nWith the desire of seeing as much as possible of all that was interesting in the mechanical, architectural and picturesque line, on my return journey to London, I determined to walk, halting here and there by the way.  The season of the year and the state of the weather were favourable for my purpose.  I accordingly commenced my pedestrian tour on Saturday morning, the 17th September.  I set out for Manchester. It was a long but pleasant walk.  I well remember, when nearing Manchester, that I sat down to rest for a time on Patricroft Bridge. I was attracted by the rural aspect of the country, and the antique cottages of the neighbourhood.  The Bridgewater Canal lay before me, and as I was told that it was the first mile of the waterway that the great Duke had made, it became quite classic ground in my eyes. I little thought at the time that I was so close to a piece of ground that should afterwards become my own, and where I should for twenty years carry on the most active and interesting business of my life.\\n\\nI reached Manchester at seven in the evening, and took up my quarters at the King's Arms Inn, Deansgate.  Next day was Sunday.  I attended service in the Cathedral, then called the Old Church.  I was much interested by the service, as well as by the architecture of the building.  Some of the details were well worthy of attention, being very original, and yet the whole was not of the best period of Gothic architecture.  Some of the old buildings about the Cathedral were very interesting.  They were of a most quaint character, yet bold and effective.  Much finely carved oak timber work was introduced into them; and on the whole they gave a very striking illustration of the style of domestic architecture which prevailed in England some three or four centuries ago.\\n\\nOn the following day I called upon Mr. Edward Tootal, of York Street. He was a well-known man in Manchester.\\n\\nI had the happiness of meeting him in London a few months before. He then kindly invited me to call upon him should I ever visit Manchester, when he would endeavour to obtain for me sight of some of the most remarkable manufacturing establishments.  Mr. Tootal was as good as his word.  He received me most cordially, and at once proceeded to take me to the extensive machine factory of Messrs. Sharp, Roberts, and Co.  I found to my delight that a considerable portion of the establishment was devoted to the production of machine tools, a department of mechanical business then rising into the highest importance.  Mr. Roberts, an admirable mechanic as well as inventor, had derived many of his ideas on the subject while working with Mr. Maudslay in London, and he had carried them out with many additions and improvements of his own contrivance.  Indeed, Roberts was one of the most capable men of his time, and is entitled to be regarded as one of the true pioneers of modern mechanical mechanism.\\n\\nThrough the kindness of Mr. Tootal I had also the opportunity of visiting and inspecting some of the most extensive cotton mills in Manchester.  I was greatly pleased with the beautiful contrivances displayed in the machinery.  They were perfect examples of the highest order of ingenuity, combined with that kind of common-sense which casts aside all mere traditional forms and arrangements of parts, such as do not essentially contribute to the efficiency of the machine in the performance of its special and required purpose.  I found much to admire in the design as well as in the execution of the details of the machines.\\n\\nThe arrangement and management of the manufactories were admirable. The whole of the buildings, howsoever extensive and apparently complicated, worked like one grand and perfectly constructed machine.\\n\\nI was also much impressed by the keen interest which the proprietors of these vast establishments took in the minute details of their machinery, as well as by their intelligent and practical acquaintance with the technical minutiae of their business.  Although many of them were men of fortune, they continued to take as deep an interest in such matters as if they were beginning life and had their fortunes still to make.  Their chief ambition was to be at the head of a thoroughly well-managed and prosperous establishment.  No detail, be it ever so small, was beneath their care and attention.  To a young man like myself, then about to enter upon a similar career of industry, these lessons were very important.  They were encouraging examples of carefully thought out designs, carried into admirable results by close attention to details, ever watchful carefulness, and indomitable perseverance.  I brooded over these circumstances, They filled my mind with hope.  They encouraged me to go on in the path which I had selected; and I believed that at some time or other I might be enabled to imitate the examples of zeal and industry which I had witnessed during my stay in Manchester.  It was then that I bethought me of settling down in this busy neighbourhood; and as I plodded my way back to London this thought continually occupied me. It took root in my mind and grew, and at length the idea became a reality.\\n\\nI did not take the shortest route on my return journey to London. I desired to pass through the most interesting and picturesque places without unduly diverging from the right direction.  I wished to see the venerable buildings and cathedrals of the olden time, as well as the engineering establishments of the new.  Notwithstanding my love for mechanics I still retained a spice of the antiquarian feeling. It enabled me to look back to the remote past, into the material records of man's efforts hundreds of years ago, and contrast them with the modern progress of arts and sciences.  I was especially interested in the architecture of bygone ages; but here, alas! arts and sciences have done nothing.  Modern Gothic architecture is merely an imitation of the old, and often a very bad imitation.  Even ancient domestic architecture is much superior to the modern.  We can now only imitate it; and often spoil when imitating.\\n\\nI left Manchester and turned my steps in the direction of Coalbrookdale. I passed through a highly picturesque country, in which I enjoyed the sight of many old timber houses, most attractive subjects for my pencil. My route lay through Whitchurch, Wem, and Wellington; then past the Wrekin to Coalbrookdale.  Before arriving there I saw the first iron bridge constructed in England, an object of historical interest in that class of structures.  It was because of the superb quality of the castings produced at Coalbrookdale that the ironmasters there were able to accomplish the building of a bridge of that material, which before had baffled all projectors both at home and abroad\\n\\nI possessed a letter of introduction to the manager, and was received by him most cordially.  He permitted me to examine the works. I was greatly interested at the sight of the processes of casting. Many beautiful objects were turned out for architectural, domestic, and other purposes.  I saw nothing particularly novel, however, in the methods and processes of moulding and casting.\\n\\nThe excellence of the work depended for the most part upon the great care and skill exercised by the workmen of the foundry.  They seemed to vie with each other in turning out the best castings, and their models or patterns were made with the utmost care.  I was particularly impressed with the cheerful zeal and activity of the workmen and foremen of this justly celebrated establishment.\\n\\nOn leaving Coalbrookdale I trudged my way towards Wolverhampton. I rested at Shiffnal for the night.  Next day I was in the middle of the Black Country.  I had no letters of introduction to employers in Wolverhampton; so that, without stopping there, I proceeded at once to Dudley.  The Black Country is anything but picturesque.  The earth seems to have been turned inside out.  Its entrails are strewn about; nearly the entire surface of the ground is covered with cinder-heaps and mounds of scoriae.  The coal which has been drawn from below ground is blazing on the surface.  The district is crowded with iron furnaces, puddling furnaces, and coal-pit engine furnaces.  By day and by night the country is glowing with fire, and the smoke of the ironworks hovers over it.  There is a rumbling and clanking of iron forges and rolling mills.  Workmen covered with smut, and with fierce white eyes, are seen moving about amongst the glowing iron and the dull thud of forge-hammers. Amidst these flaming, smoky, clanging works, I beheld the remains of what had once been happy farmhouses, now ruined and deserted. The ground underneath them had sunk by the working out of the coal, and they were falling to pieces.  They had in former times been surrounded by clumps of trees; but only the skeletons of them remained, dead, black, and leafless.  The grass had been parched and killed by the vapours of sulphurous acid thrown out by the chimneys; and every herbaceous object was of a ghastly gray--the emblem of vegetable death in its saddest aspect.  Vulcan had driven out Ceres.  In some places I heard a sort of chirruping sound, as of some forlorn bird haunting the ruins of the old farmsteads.  But no! the chirrup was a vile delusion.  It proceeded from the shrill creaking of the coal-winding chains, which were placed in small tunnels beneath the hedgeless road.\\n\\nI went into some of the forges to see the workmen at their labours. There was no need of introduction; the works were open to all, for they were unsurrounded by walls.  I saw the white-hot iron run out from the furnace; I saw it spun, as it were, into bars and iron ribbands, with an ease and rapidity which seemed marvellous.  There were also the ponderous hammers and clanking rolling-mills.  I wandered from one to another without restraint.  I lingered among the blast furnaces, seeing the flood of molten iron run out from time to time, and remained there until it was late.  When it became dark the scene was still more impressive.  The workmen within seemed to be running about amidst the flames as in a pandemonium; while around and outside the horizon was a glowing belt of fire, making even the stars look pale and feeble. At last I came away with reluctance, and made my way towards Dudley. I reached the town at a late hour.  I was exhausted in mind and body, yet the day had been most interesting and exciting.  A sound sleep refreshed me, and I was up in the morning early, to recommence my journey of inquiry,\\n\\nI made my way to the impressive ruins of Dudley Castle, the remnant of a very ancient stronghold, originally built by Dud, the Saxon. The castle is situated on a finely wooded hill; it is so extensive that it more resembles the ruins of a town than of a single building. You enter through a treble gateway, and see the remnants of the moat, the court, and the keep.  Here are the central hall, the guard, rooms, and the chapel.  It must have been a magnificent structure.  In the Midlands it was known as the \\\"Castle of the Woods\\\" Now it is abandoned by its owners, and surrounded by the Black Country.  It is undermined by collieries, and even penetrated by a canal.  The castle walls sometimes tremble when a blast occurs in the bowels of the mountain beneath.  The town of Dudley lies quite close to the castle, and was doubtless protected by it in ancient times.\\n\\nThe architectural remains are of various degrees of antiquity, and are well worthy of study, as embodying the successive periods which they represent.  Their melancholy grandeur is rendered all the more impressive by the coal and iron works with which they are surrounded-- the olden type of buildings confronting the modern.  The venerable trees struggle for existence under the destroying influence of sulphurous acid; while the grass is withered and the vegetation everywhere blighted.  I sat down on an elevated part of the ruins, and looked down upon the extensive district, with its roaring and blazing furnaces, the smoke of which blackened the country as far as the eye could reach; and as I watched the decaying trees I thought of the price we had to pay for our vaunted supremacy in the manufacture of iron.  We may fill our purses, but we pay a heavy price for it in the loss of picturesqueness and beauty.  I left the castle with reluctance, and proceeded to inspect the limestone quarries in the neighbourhood. The limestone has long been worked out from underneath the castle; but not far from it is Wren's Nest Hill, a mountain of limestone. The wrens have left, but the quarries are there.  The walk to the hill is along green lanes and over quiet fields.  I entered one of the quarries opened out in the sloping precipice, and penetrated as far as the glimmer of sunlight enabled me to see my way.  But the sound of the dripping of water from the root of the cave warned me that I was approaching some deep pool, into which a false step might plunge me. I therefore kept within the light of day.  An occasional ray of the sun lit up the enormous rock pillars which the quarrymen had left to support the roof.  It was a most impressive sight.\\n\\nHaving emerged from the subterranean cave, I proceeded on my way to Birmingham.  I reached the town in the evening, and found most comfortable quarters.  On the following day I visited some of the factories where processes were carried on in connection with the Birmingham trade.  I saw the mills where sheet brass and copper were rolled for the purpose of being plated with silver.  There was nothing in these processes of novel interest, though I picked up many practical hints.  I could not fail to be attracted by the dexterous and rapid manipulation of the work in hand, even by boys and girls whose quick sight and nimble fingers were educated to a high degree of perfection. I could have spent a month profitably among the vast variety of small traders in metal, of which Birmingham is the headquarters. Even in what is called \\\"the toy trade,\\\" I found a vast amount of skill displayed in the production of goldsmith work, in earrings, brooches, gold chains, rings, beads, and glass eyes for stuffed birds, dolls, and men.\\n\\nI was especially attracted by Soho, once the famous manufacturing establishment of Boulton and Watt.  Although this was not the birthplace\\\\* \\\\[footnote... The birthplace of the condensing engine of Watt was the workshop in the Glasgow University, where he first contrived and used a separate condenser--the true and vital element in Watt's invention. The condenser afterwards attained its true effective manhood at Soho The Newcomen engine was in fact a condensing engine, but as the condensation was effected inside the steam cylinder it was a very costly source of power in respect to steam.  Watt's happy idea of condensing in a separate vessel removed the defect.  This was first done in his experimental engine in the Glasgow University workshop, and before he had made the one at Kinniel for Dr. Roebuck.  ...\\\\] of the condensing steam-engine it was the place where it attained its full manhood of efficiency, and became the source and origin of English manufacturing power.  Watt's engine has had a greater influence on the productive arts of mankind than any other that can be named.  Boulton also was a thorough man of business, without whom, perhaps, Watt could never have made his way against the world, or perfected his magnificent invention.  Not less interesting to my mind was the memory of that incomparable mechanic,  William Murdoch, a man of indomitable energy, and Watt's right-hand man in the highest practical sense.  Murdoch was the inventor of the first model locomotive, and the inventor of gas for lighting purposes; and yet he always kept himself in the background, for he was excessively modest. He was happiest when he could best promote the welfare of the great house of Boulton and Watt.  Indeed he was a man whose memory ought to be held in the highest regard by all true engineers and mechanics.\\n\\nThe sight which I obtained of the vast series of workshops of this celebrated establishment--filled with evidences of the mechanical genius of these master minds--made me feel that I was indeed on classic ground in regard to everything connected with steam-engine machinery.  Some of the engines designed by Watt--the prototypes of the powerful condensing engines of the present day--were still performing their daily quota of work.  There was \\\"Old Bess,\\\" a sort of experimental engine, upon which Watt had tried many adaptations and alterations, for the purpose of suiting it for pumping water from coal mines.  There was also the engine with the sun-and-planet motion, an invention of William Murdoch's. Both of these engines were still at work.\\n\\nI went through the workshops, where I was specially interested by seeing the action of the machine tools.  There I observed Murdoch's admirable system of transmitting power from one central engine to other small vacuum engines attached to the individual machines they were set to work.  The power was communicated by pipes led from the central air or exhaust pump to small vacuum or atmospheric engines devoted to the driving of each separate machine, thus doing away with all shafting and leather belts, the required speed being kept up or modified at pleasure without in any way interfering with the other machines. --This vacuum method of transmitting power dates from the time of Papin; but until it received the masterly touch of Murdoch it remained a dead contrivance for more than a century.\\n\\nI concluded my visits to the workshops of Birmingham by calling upon a little known but very ingenious man, whose work I had seen before I left Edinburgh, in a beautifully constructed foot turning-lathe made by John Drain.  I was so much impressed with the exquisite design, execution, and completeness of the lathe, that I made it one of my chief objects to find out John Drain's workshop.  It was with some difficulty that I found him.  He was little known in Birmingham. His workshops were very small; they consisted of only one or two rooms. His exquisite lathes were not much in demand.  They found their way chiefly to distant parts of the country, where they were highly esteemed.\\n\\nI found that he had some exquisitely finished lathes completed and in hand for engraving the steel plates for printing bank notes.  They were provided with the means of producing such intricate ornamental patterns as to defy the utmost skill of the forger.  Perkins had done a good deal in the same way; but Drain's exquisite mechanism enabled his engraving lathes to surpass anything that had before been attempted in the same line.  I believe that Drain's earnest attention to his work, in which he had little or no assistance, undermined his health, and arrested the career of one who, had he lived, would have attained the highest position in his profession.  I shall never forget the rare treat which his fine mechanism afforded me.  Its prominent quality was absolute truth and accuracy in every part.\\n\\nHaving now had enough of the Black Country and of Birmingham workshops, I proceeded towards London.  There were no more manufacturing districts to be visited.  Everything now was to be green lanes, majestic trees, old mansions, venerable castles, and picturesque scenery.  There is no way of seeing a country properly except on foot.  By railway you whiz past and see nothing.  Even by coach the best parts of the scenery are unseen.  \\\"Shank's naig\\\" is the best of all methods, provided you have time.  I had still some days to spare before the conclusion of my holiday.  I therefore desired to see some of the beautiful scenery and objects of antiquarian interest before returning to work.\\n\\nI made my way across country to Kenilworth.  The weather was fine, and the walk was perfect.  The wayside was bordered by grassy sward. Wide and irregular margins extended on each side of the road, and noble trees and untrinnned hedges, in their glowing autumnal tint, extended far and wide.  Everything was in the most gloriously neglected and therefore highly picturesque condition.  Here and there old farmhouses and labourers' cottages peeped up from amidst the trees and hedges-- worthy of the landscape painter's highest skill.\",\"timestamp\":1639289925,\"title\":\"\\nI spent another day in crossing the Mersey to Birkenhead--then a very small collection of buildings--wandered about the neighbourhood\"},\"digest\":\"O1lAg1sc0Y42UzdYy730B2KsUnOgifJvEXZKL_1y0dw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x368119602f169B8146fb749c112EF9CC81197C53\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h56W5qkkwTuVVhsCFpvS3LDPp-D3KN190iQFlBF6Weg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cdSIND8YsV_wksYAxTMxoSFhPhhqPydX6BAqN3hZFow\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6TzE2jB1Z5QR9wg53HELlMO-70DZJxVCp1AmU8R65P2UfxcTUsMUv6ZYuW3XSrk1V3DeXyNS4L7NBOXvXbpO5Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x88ebe269e203970a97271f220377f57ee15488a5aacd7588ec3fc4198a4eb5306231121bf39c1a5923efc92c6f0375fdffe7d4f9f6b9811e4bc88f7b97b2f2e31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h56W5qkkwTuVVhsCFpvS3LDPp-D3KN190iQFlBF6Weg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cdSIND8YsV_wksYAxTMxoSFhPhhqPydX6BAqN3hZFow\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"O1lAg1sc0Y42UzdYy730B2KsUnOgifJvEXZKL_1y0dw\"}"
