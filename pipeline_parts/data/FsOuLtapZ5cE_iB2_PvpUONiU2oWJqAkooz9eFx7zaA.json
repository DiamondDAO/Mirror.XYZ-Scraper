"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Chainalysis: A small number of insiders grab most of the proceeds from the NFT. On December 28, a recent study by Chainalysis showed that a small number of NFT participants received most of the proceeds. Chainalysis pointed out in its report that frequent investments in a series of NFT collectibles seem to bring extremely high profits, and some whitelisted users can take advantage of this. \\\"Whitelisting\\\" refers to the practice of allowing certain participants or others to purchase new NFTs at a much lower price than other users during the period when digital files are turned into digital asset minting activities on the blockchain. Chainalysis quoted Opensea data to show that 75.7% of the newly generated NFT users who were whitelisted and subsequently sold made profits, while only 20.8% of the users who were not whitelisted made profits. Chainalysis found that if it is not whitelisted, it is almost impossible to obtain excess returns from NFT minting transactions. The study stated: â€œVery few highly sophisticated investors have made most of the profits during the NFT collection process. Especially in NFTs. In the minting stage, early whitelisted supporters can obtain lower prices and thus obtain greater profits. We also found that investors will use robots during the NFT minting period. These conditions will shut out the less mature NFT users. , Even leading to the failure of related transactions, thus making them pay more.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640788781,\"title\":\"Chainalysis: A few insiders grab most of the proceeds from NFT\"},\"digest\":\"l5ySoX51gKHssZ1Zgis1X9gikgj8ULhnix9_brFdEtc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x982fccb42B132C5fC07D29Aa9A68935C38661aD7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u2U9rMDNu9hLDEfnKJgpGhCtH1QnVIBD5fUqKalFguY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bMDKbmkjvKNpUEdtWBMAoY_nwS-ecMAkrUjevFMc1g8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7pd0arVw6qPP2C9jRI8-7AG02FECF_8rCOrrmFcbwq6UoVx99DNmTYPDf5h0Rs5bc3bz8JUk5D81t6YQS16y3w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x513ffb52a3d7c419589b188304edc6d951f3fe7f17146d1515c5e930d9a4f3866b038ceb618822d4b1eb26eaafb352dd6952acff4ba993e2c32283ba8625c2161b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u2U9rMDNu9hLDEfnKJgpGhCtH1QnVIBD5fUqKalFguY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bMDKbmkjvKNpUEdtWBMAoY_nwS-ecMAkrUjevFMc1g8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l5ySoX51gKHssZ1Zgis1X9gikgj8ULhnix9_brFdEtc\"}"
