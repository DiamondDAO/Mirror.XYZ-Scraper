"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The protracted struggle between science and the classics appears\\nto be drawing to a close, with victory about to perch on the\\nbanner of science, as a perusal of almost any university or\\ncollege catalogue shows.  While a limited knowledge of both Greek\\nand Latin is important for the correct use of our own language,\\nthe amount till recently required, in my judgment, has been\\nabsurdly out of proportion to the intrinsic value of these\\nbranches, or perhaps more correctly roots, of study.  The\\nclassics have been thoroughly and painfully threshed out, and it\\nseems impossible that anything new can be unearthed.  We may\\nequal the performances of the past, but there is no opportunity\\nto surpass them or produce anything original.  Even the\\nmuch-vaunted \\\"mental training\\\" argument is beginning to pall; for\\nwould not anything equally difficult give as good developing\\nresults, while by learning a live matter we kill two birds with\\none stone?  There can be no question that there are many forces\\nand influences in Nature whose existence we as yet little more\\nthan suspect.  How much more interesting it would be if, instead\\nof reiterating our past achievements, the magazines and\\nliterature of the period should devote their consideration to\\nwhat we do NOT know!  It is only through investigation and\\nresearch that inventions come; we may not find what we are in\\nsearch of, but may discover something of perhaps greater moment.\\nIt is probable that the principal glories of the future will be\\nfound in as yet but little trodden paths, and as Prof. Cortlandt\\njustly says at the close of his history, \\\"Next to religion, we\\nhave most to hope from science.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                        CONTENTS.\\n\\n\\n                        BOOK  I.\\n```\\n\\nCHAPTERI.-JUPITER.II.-ANTECEDENTALIII.-PRESIDENT BEARWARDEN'S SPEECHIV.-PROF.

What transports of delight, what ecstatic bliss, was\\ntheirs!  Men had discovered and mastered the secret of apergy,\\nand now, \\\"little lower than the angels,\\\" they could soar through\\nspace, leaving even planets and comets behind.\\n\\n\\\"Is it not strange,\\\" said Dr. Cortlandt, \\\"that though it has been\\nknown for over a century that bodies charged with unlike\\nelectricities attract one another, and those charged with like\\nrepel, no one thought of utilizing the counterpart of\\ngravitation?  In the nineteenth century, savants and Indian\\njugglers performed experiments with their disciples and masses of\\ninert matter, by causing them to remain without visible support\\nat some distance from the ground; and while many of these, of\\ncourse, were quacks, some were on the right track, though they\\ndid not push their research.\\\"\\n\\nPresident Bearwarden and Ayrault assented.  They were steering\\nfor an apparently hard part of the planet's surface, about a\\ndegree and a half north of its equator.\\n\\n\\\"Since Jupiter's axis is almost at right angles to  the plane of\\nits orbit,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"being inclined only about one\\ndegree and a half, instead of twenty-three and a half, as was the\\nearth's till nearly so recently, it will be possible for us to\\nhave any climate we wish, from constantly warm at the equator to\\nconstantly cool or cold as we approach the poles, without being\\ntroubled by extremes of winter and summer.\\\"\\n\\nUntil the Callisto entered the planet's atmosphere, its five\\nmoons appeared like silver shields against the black sky, but now\\nthings were looking more terrestrial, and they began to feel at\\nhome.  Bearwarden put down his note-book, and Ayrault returned a\\nphotograph to his pocket, while all three gazed at their new\\nabode.  Beneath them was a vast continent variegated by chains of\\nlakes and rivers stretching away in all directions except toward\\nthe equator, where lay a placid ocean as far as their telescopes\\ncould pierce.  To the eastward were towering and massive\\nmountains, and along the southern border of the continent smoking\\nvolcanoes, while toward the west they saw forests, gently rolling\\nplains, and table-lands that would have satisfied a poet or set\\nan agriculturist's heart at rest.  \\\"How I should like to mine\\nthose hills for copper, or drain the swamps to the south!\\\"\\nexclaimed Col. Bearwarden.  \\\"The Lake Superior mines and the\\nreclamation of the Florida Everglades would be nothing to this.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Any inhabitants we may find here have so much land at their\\ndisposal that they will not need to drain swamps on account of\\npressure of population for some time,\\\" put in the doctor.\\n\\n\\\"I hope we may find some four-legged inhabitants,\\\" said Ayrault,\\nthinking of their explosive magazine rifles.  \\\"If Jupiter is\\npassing through its Jurassic or Mesozoic period, there must be\\nany amount of some kind of game.\\\"  Just then a quiver shook the\\nCallisto, and glancing to the right they noticed one of the\\nvolcanoes in violent eruption.  Smoke filled the air in clouds,\\nhot stones and then floods of lava poured from the crater, while\\neven the walls of the hermetically sealed Callisto could not\\narrest the thunderous crashes that made the interior of the car\\nresound.\\n\\n\\\"Had we not better move on?\\\" said Bearwarden, and accordingly\\nthey went toward the woods they had first seen.  Finding a firm\\nstrip of land between the forest and an arm of the sea, they\\ngently grounded the Callisto, and not being altogether sure how\\nthe atmosphere of their new abode would suit terrestrial lungs,\\nor what its pressure to the square inch might be, they cautiously\\nopened a port-hole a crack, retaining their hold upon it with its\\nscrew.  Instantly there was a rush and a whistling sound as of\\nescaping steam, while in a few moments their barometer stood at\\nthirty-six inches, whereupon they closed the opening.\\n\\n\\\"I fancy,\\\" said Dr. Cortlandt, \\\"we had better wait now till we\\nbecome accustomed to this pressure.  I do not believe it will go\\nmuch higher, for the window made but little resistance when we\\nshut it.\\\"\\n\\nFinding they were not inconvenienced by a pressure but little\\ngreater than that of a deep coal-mine, they again opened the\\nport, whereupon their barometer showed a further rise to\\nforty-two, and then remained stationary.  Finding also that the\\nchemical composition of the air suited them, and that they had no\\ndifficulty in breathing, the pressure being the same as that\\nsustained by a diver in fourteen feet of water, they opened a\\ndoor and emerged.  They knew fairly well what to expect, and were\\nnot disturbed by their new conditions.  Though they had\\napparently gained a good deal in weight as a result of their\\nethereal journey, this did not incommode them; for though\\nJupiter's volume is thirteen hundred times that of the earth, on\\naccount of its lesser specific gravity, it has but three hundred\\ntimes the mass--i. e., it would weigh but three hundred times as\\nmuch.  Further, although a cubic foot of water or anything else\\nweighs 2.5 as much as on earth, objects near the equator, on\\naccount of Jupiter's rapid rotation, weigh one fifth less than\\nthey do at the poles, by reason of the centrifugal force.\\nInfluenced by this fact, and also because they were 483,000,000\\nmiles from the sun, instead of 92,000,000 as on earth, they had\\nsteered for the northern limit of Jupiter's tropics.  And, in\\naddition to this, they could easily apply the apergetic power in\\nany degree to themselves when beyond the limits of the Callisto,\\nand so be attracted to any extent, from twice the pull they\\nreceive from gravitation on earth to almost nothing.\\n\\nBearwarden and Ayrault shouldered their rifles, while Dr.\\nCortlandt took a repeating shot-gun with No. 4 shot, and, having\\nalso some hunting-knives and a sextant, all three set out in a\\nnorthwesterly direction.  The ground was rather soft, and a warm\\nvapor seemed to rise from it.  To the east the sky was veiled by\\ndense clouds of smoke from the towering volcanoes, while on their\\nleft the forest seemed to extend without limit.  Clumps of huge\\nferns were scattered about, and the ground was covered with\\ncurious tracks.\\n\\n\\\"Jupiter is evidently passing through a Carboniferous or Devonian\\nperiod such as existed on earth, though, if consistent with its\\nsize, it should be on a vastly larger scale,\\\" said the doctor.\\n\\\"I never believed in the theory,\\\" he continued, \\\"that the larger\\nthe planet the smaller should be its inhabitants, and always\\nconsidered it a makeshift, put forward in the absence of definite\\nknowledge, the idea being apparently that the weight of very\\nlarge creatures would be too great for their strength.  Of the\\nfact that mastodons and creatures far larger than any now living\\non earth existed there, we have absolute proof, though\\ngravitation must have been practically the same then as now.\\\"\\n\\nJust here they came upon a number of huge bones, evidently the\\nremains of some saurian, and many times the size of a grown\\ncrocodile.  On passing a growth of most luxuriant vegetation,\\nthey saw a half-dozen sacklike objects, and drawing nearer\\nnoticed that the tops began to swell, and at the same time became\\nlighter in colour.  Just as the doctor was about to investigate\\none of them with his duck-shot, the enormously inflated tops of\\nthe creatures collapsed with a loud report, and the entire group\\nsoared away.  When about to alight, forty yards off, they\\ndistended membranous folds in the manner of wings, which checked\\ntheir descent, and on touching the ground remained where they\\nwere without rebound.\\n\\n\\\"We expected to find all kinds of reptiles and birds,\\\" exclaimed\\nthe doctor.  \\\"But I do not know  how we should class those\\ncreatures.  They seem to have pneumatic feet and legs, for their\\nmotion was certainly not produced like that of frogs.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the party came up with them the heads again began to swell.\\n\\n\\\"I will perforate the air-chamber of one,\\\" said Col. Bearwarden,\\nwithdrawing the explosive cartridge from the barrel of his rifle\\nand substituting one with a solid ball.  \\\"This will doubtless\\ndisable one so that we can examine it.\\\"\\n\\nJust as they were about to rise, he shot the largest through the\\nneck.  All but the wounded one, soared off, while Bearwarden,\\nAyrault, and Cortlandt approached to examine it more closely.\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"this vertebrate--for that is as\\ndefinitely as we can yet describe it--forces a great pressure of\\nair into its head and neck, which, by the action of valves, it\\nmust allow to rush into its very rudimentary lower extremities,\\ndistending them with such violence that the body is shot upward\\nand forward.  You may have noticed the tightly inflated portion\\nunderneath as they left the ground.\\\"\\n\\nWhile speaking he had moved rather near, when suddenly a\\npartially concealed mouth opened, showing the unmistakable tongue\\nand fangs of a serpent.  It emitted a hissing sound, and the\\nsmall eyes gleamed maliciously.\\n\\n\\\"Do you believe it is a poisonous species?\\\" asked Ayrault.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect it is,\\\" replied the doctor; \\\"for, though it is\\ndoubtless able to leap with great accuracy upon its prey, we saw\\nit took some time to recharge the upper air-chamber, so that,\\nwere it not armed with poison glands, it would fall an easy\\nvictim to its more powerful and swifter contemporaries, and would\\nsoon become extinct.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As it will be unable to spring for some time,\\\" said Bearwarden,\\n\\\"we might as well save it the disappointment of trying,\\\" and,\\nsnapping the used shell from his rifle, he fired an explosive\\nball into the reptile, whereupon about half the body disappeared,\\nwhile a sickening odour arose.  Although the sun was still far\\nabove the horizon, the rapidity with which it was descending\\nshowed that the short night of less than five hours would soon be\\nupon them; and though short it might be very dark, for they were\\nin the tropics, and the sun, going down perpendicularly, must\\nalso pass completely around the globe, instead of, as in northern\\nlatitudes on earth in summer, approaching the horizon obliquely,\\nand not going far below it.  A slight and diffused sound here\\nseemed to rise from the ground all about them, for which they\\ncould not account.  Presently it became louder, and as the sun\\ntouched the horizon, it poured forth in prolonged strains.  The\\nlarge trumpet-shaped lilies, reeds, and heliotropes seemed fairly\\nto throb as they raised their anthem to the sky and the setting\\nsun, while the air grew dark with clouds of birds that gradually\\nalighted on the ground, until, as the chorus grew fainter and\\ngradually ceased, they flew back to their nests.  The three\\ncompanions had stood astonished while this act was played.  The\\ndoctor then spoke:\\n\\n\\\"This is the most marvellous  development of Nature I have seen,\\nfor its wonderful divergence from, and yet analogy to, what takes\\nplace on earth.  You know our flowers offer honey, as it were, as\\nbait to insects, that in eating or collecting it they may catch\\nthe pollen on their legs and so carry it to other flowers,\\nperhaps of the opposite sex.  Here flowers evidently appeal to\\nthe sense of hearing instead of taste, and make use of birds, of\\nwhich there are enormous numbers, instead of winged insects, of\\nwhich I have seen none, one being perhaps the natural result of\\nthe other.  The flowers have become singers by long practice, or\\nelse, those that were most musical having had the best chance to\\nreproduce, we have a neat illustration of the 'survival of the\\nfittest.'  The sound is doubtless produced by a shrinking of the\\nfibres as the sun withdraws its heat, in which case we may expect\\nanother song at sunrise, when the same result will be effected by\\ntheir expanding.\\\"\\n\\nSearching for a camping-place in which to pass the coming hours,\\nthey saw lights flitting about like will-o'-the-wisps, but\\nbrighter and intermittent.\\n\\n\\\"They seem to be as bright as sixteen-candle-power lamps, but the\\nlight is yellower, and appears to emanate from a comparatively\\nlarge surface, certainly nine or ten inches square,\\\" said the\\ndoctor.\\n\\nThey soon gave up the chase, however, for the lights were\\ncontinually moving and frequently went out.  While groping in the\\ngrowing darkness, they came upon a brown object about the size of\\na small dog and close to the ground.  It flew off with a humming\\ninsect sound, and as it did so it showed the brilliant\\nphosphorescent glow they had observed.\\n\\n\\\"That is a good-sized fire-fly,\\\" said Bearwarden.  \\\"Evidently the\\ninsects here are on the same scale as everything else.  They are\\nlike the fire-flies in Cuba, which the Cubans are said to put\\ninto a glass box and get light enough from to read by.  Here they\\nwould need only one, if it could be induced to give its light\\ncontinuously.\\\"\\n\\nHaving found an open space on high ground, they sat down, and\\nBearwarden struck his repeater, which, for convenience, had been\\narranged for Jupiter time, dividing the day into ten hours,\\nbeginning at noon, midnight being therefore five o'clock.\\n\\n\\\"Twenty minutes past four,\\\" said he, \\\"which would correspond to\\nabout a quarter to eleven on earth.  As the sun rises at\\nhalf-past seven, it will be dark about three hours, for the time\\nbetween dawn and daylight will, of course, be as short as that we\\nhave just experienced between sunset and night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If we stay here long,\\\" said the doctor, \\\"I suppose we shall\\nbecome accustomed, like sailors, to taking our four, or in this\\ncase five, hours on duty, and five hours off.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or,\\\" added Ayrault, \\\"we can sleep ten consecutive hours and take\\nthe next ten for exploring and hunting, having the sun for one\\nhalf the time and the moons for the other.\\\"\\n\\nBearwarden and Cortlandt now rolled themselves in their blankets\\nand were soon asleep, while Ayrault, whose turn it was to watch\\ntill the moons rose--for they had not yet enough confidence in\\ntheir new domain to sleep in darkness simultaneously--leaned his\\nback against a rock and lighted his pipe.  In the distance he saw\\nthe torrents of fiery lava from the volcanoes reflected in the\\nsky, and faintly heard their thunderous crashes, while the\\nfire-flies twinkled unconcernedly in the hollow, and the night\\nwinds swayed the fernlike branches.  Then he gazed at the earth,\\nwhich, but little above the horizon, shone with a faint but\\nsteady ray, and his mind's eye ran beyond his natural vision\\nwhile he pictured to himself the girl of his heart, wishing that\\nby some communion of spirits he might convey his thoughts to her,\\nand receive hers.  It was now the first week of January on earth.\\nHe could almost see her house and the snow-clad trees in the\\npark, and knew that at that hour she was dressing for dinner, and\\nhoped and believed that he was in her heart.  While he thus\\nmused, one moon after another rose, each at a different phase,\\ntill three were at once in the sky.  Adjusting the electric\\nprotection- wires that were to paralyze any creature that\\nattempted to come within the circle, and would arouse them by\\nringing a bell, he knocked the ashes from his pipe, rolled\\nhimself in a blanket, and was soon asleep beside his friends.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER II.\\n\\n\\n                      ANTECEDENTAL.\\n```\\n\\n\\\"Come in!\\\" sounded a voice, as Dr. Cortlandt and Dick Ayrault\\ntapped at the door of the President of the Terrestrial Axis\\nStraightening Company's private office on the morning of the 21st\\nof June, A. D. 2000.  Col. Bearwarden sat at his capacious desk,\\nthe shadows passing over his face as April clouds flit across the\\nsun.  He was a handsome man, and young for the important post he\\nfilled--being scarcely forty--a graduate of West Point, with\\ngreat executive ability, and a wonderful engineer.  \\\"Sit down,\\nchappies,\\\" said he; \\\"we have still a half hour before I begin to\\nread the report I am to make to the stockholders and\\nrepresentatives of all the governments, which is now ready.  I\\nknow YOU smoke,\\\" passing a box of Havanas to the professor.\\n\\nProf. Cortlandt, LL. D., United States Government expert,\\nappointed to examine the company's calculations, was about fifty,\\nwith a high forehead, greyish hair, and quick, grey eyes, a\\ngeologist and astronomer, and altogether as able a man, in his\\nown way, as Col. Bearwarden in his.  Richard Ayrault, a large\\nstockholder and one of the honorary vice-presidents in the\\ncompany, was about thirty, a university man, by nature a\\nscientist, and engaged to one of the prettiest society girls, who\\nwas then a student at Vassar, in the beautiful town of\\nPoughkeepsie.\\n\\n\\\"Knowing the way you carry things in your mind, and the\\ndifficulty of rattling you,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"we have dropped in\\non our way to hear the speech that I would not miss for a\\nfortune.  Let us know if we bother you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Impossible, dear boy,\\\" replied the president genially.  \\\"Since I\\nsurvived your official investigations, I think I deserve some of\\nyour attention informally.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here are my final examinations,\\\" said Cortlandt, handing\\nBearwarden a roll of papers.  \\\"I have been over all your figures,\\nand testify to their accuracy in the appendix I have added.\\\"\\n\\nSo they sat and chatted about the enterprise that interested\\nCortlandt and Ayrault almost as much as Bearwarden himself.  As\\nthe clock struck eleven, the president of the company put on his\\nhat, and, saying au revoir to his friends, crossed the street to\\nthe Opera House, in which he was to read a report that would be\\ncopied in all the great journals and heard over thousands of\\nmiles of wire in every part of the globe.  When he arrived, the\\nvast building was already filled with a distinguished company,\\nrepresenting the greatest intelligence, wealth, and powers of the\\nworld.  Bearwarden went in by the stage entrance, exchanging\\ngreetings as he did so with officers of the company and directors\\nwho had come to hear him.  Cortlandt and Ayrault entered by the\\nregular door, the former going to the Government representatives'\\nbox, the latter to join his fiancee, Sylvia Preston, who was\\nthere with her mother.  Bearwarden had a roll of manuscript at\\nhand, but so well did he know his speech that he scarcely glanced\\nat it.  After being introduced by the chairman of the meeting,\\nand seeing that his audience was all attention, he began, holding\\nhimself erect, his clear, powerful voice making every part of the\\nbuilding ring.\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER III.\\n\\n             PRESIDENT BEARWARDEN'S SPEECH.\\n```\\n\\n\\\"To the Bondholders and Stockholders of the Terrestrial Axis\\nStraightening Company and Representatives of Earthly Governments.\\n\\n\\\"GENTLEMEN:  You know that the objects of this company are, to\\nstraighten the axis of the earth, to combine the extreme heat of\\nsummer with the intense cold of winter and produce a uniform\\ntemperature for each degree of latitude the year round.  At\\npresent the earth's axis--that is, the line passing through its\\ncentre and the two poles--is inclined to the ecliptic about\\ntwenty-three and a half degrees.  Our summer is produced by the\\nnorthern hemisphere's leaning at that angle towards the sun, and\\nour winter by its turning that much from it.  In one case the\\nsun's rays are caused to shine more perpendicularly, and in the\\nother more obliquely.  This wabbling, like that of a top, is the\\nsole cause of the seasons; since, owing to the eccentricity of\\nour orbit, the earth is actually fifteen hundred thousand miles\\nnearer the sun during our winter, in the northern hemisphere,\\nthan in summer.  That there is no limit to a planet's\\ninclination, and that inclination is not essential, we have\\nastronomical proof.  Venus's axis is inclined to the plane of her\\norbit seventy-five degrees, so that the arctic circle comes\\nwithin fifteen degrees of the equator, and the tropics also\\nextend to latitude seventy-five degrees, or within fifteen\\ndegrees of the poles, producing great extremes of heat and cold.\\n\\n\\\"Venus is made still more difficult of habitation by the fact\\nthat she rotates on her axis in the same time that she revolves\\nabout the sun, in the same way that the moon does about the\\nearth, so that one side must be perpetually frozen while the\\nother is parched.\\n\\n\\\"In Uranus we see the axis tilted still further, so that the\\narctic circle descends to the equator.  The most varied climate\\nmust therefore prevail during its year, whose length exceeds\\neighty-one of ours.\\n\\nThe axis of Mars is inclined about twenty-eight and two thirds\\ndegrees to the plane of its orbit; consequently its seasons must\\nbe very similar to ours, the extremes of heat and cold being\\nsomewhat greater.\\n\\n\\\"In Jupiter we have an illustration of a planet whose axis is\\nalmost at right angles to the plane of its orbit, being inclined\\nbut about a degree and a half.  The hypothetical inhabitants of\\nthis majestic planet must therefore have perpetual summer at the\\nequator, eternal winter at the poles, and in the temperate\\nregions everlasting spring.  On account of the straightness of\\nthe axis, however, even the polar inhabitants--if there are\\nany--are not oppressed by a six months' night, for all except\\nthose at the VERY pole have a sunrise and a sunset every ten\\nhours--the exact day being nine hours, fifty five minutes, and\\ntwenty-eight seconds.  The warmth of the tropics is also tempered\\nby the high winds that must result from the rapid whirl on its\\naxis, every object at the equator being carried around by this at\\nthe rate of 27,600 miles an hour, or over three thousand miles\\nfarther than the earth's equator moves in twenty-four hours.\\n\\n\\\"The inclination of the axis of our own planet has also\\nfrequently considerably exceeded that of Mars, and again has been\\nbut little greater than Jupiter's at least, this is by all odds\\nthe most reasonable explanation of the numerous Glacial periods\\nthrough which our globe has passed, and of the recurring mild\\nspells, probably lasting thousands of years, in which elephants,\\nmastodons, and other semi-tropical vertebrates roamed in Siberia,\\nsome of which died so recently that their flesh, preserved by the\\ncold, has been devoured by the dogs of modern explorers.\\n\\n\\\"It is not to be supposed that the inclining of the axes of\\nJupiter, Venus, the Earth, and the other planets, is now fixed;\\nin some cases it is known to be changing.  As long ago as 1890,\\nMajor-Gen. A. W. Drayson, of the British Army, showed, in a work\\nentitled Untrodden Ground in Astronomy and Geology, that, as a\\nresult of the second rotation of the earth, the inclination of\\nits axis was changing, it having been 23@ 28' 23\\\" on January 1,\\n1750, 23@ 27' 55.3\\\" on January 1, 1800, and 23@ 27' 30.9\\\" on\\nJanuary 1, 1850; and by calculation one hundred and ten years ago\\nshowed that in 1900 (one hundred years ago) it would be 23@ 27'\\n08\\\\.8\\\".  This natural straightening is, of course, going on, and\\nwe are merely about to anticipate it.  When this improvement was\\nmooted, all agreed that the EXTREMES of heat and cold could well\\nbe spared.  'Balance those of summer against those of winter by\\npartially straightening the axis; reduce the inclination from\\ntwenty-three degrees, thirty minutes, to about fifteen degrees,\\nbut let us stop there,' many said.  Before we had gone far,\\nhowever, we found it would be best to make the work complete.\\nThis will reclaim and make productive the vast areas of Siberia\\nand the northern part of this continent, and will do much for the\\nantarctic regions; but there will still be change in temperature;\\na wind blowing towards the equator will always be colder than one\\nblowing from it, while the slight eccentricity of the orbit will\\nsupply enough change to awaken recollections of seasons in our\\neternal spring.\\n\\n\\\"The way to accomplish this is to increase the weight of the pole\\nleaving the sun, by increasing the amount of material there for\\nthe sun to attract, and to lighten the pole approaching or\\nturning towards the sun, by removing some heavy substance from\\nit, and putting it preferably at the opposite pole.  This\\nshifting of ballast is most easily accomplished, as you will\\nreadily perceive, by confining and removing water, which is\\neasily moved and has a considerable weight.  How we purpose to\\napply these aqueous brakes to check the wabbling of the earth, by\\nmeans of the attraction of the sun, you will now see.\\n\\n\\\"From Commander Fillmore, of the Arctic Shade and the Committee\\non Bulkheads and Dams, I have just received the following by\\ncable telephone: 'The Arctic Ocean is now in condition to be\\npumped out in summer and to have its average depth increased one\\nhundred feet by the dams in winter.  We have already fifty\\nmillion square yards of windmill turbine surface in position and\\nready to move.  The cables bringing us currents from the dynamos\\nat Niagara Falls are connected with our motors, and those from\\nthe tidal dynamos at the Bay of Fundy will be in contact when\\nthis reaches you, at which moment the pumps will begin.  In\\nseveral of the landlocked gulfs and bays our system of confining\\nis so complete, that the surface of the water can be raised two\\nhundred feet above sea- level.  The polar bears will soon have to\\nuse artificial ice.  Perhaps the cheers now ringing without may\\nreach you over the telephone.'\\\"\\n\\nThe audience became greatly interested, and when the end of the\\ntelephone was applied to a microphone the room fairly rang with\\nexultant cheers, and those looking through a kintograph (visual\\ntelegraph) terminating in a camera obscura on the shores of\\nBaffin Bay were able to see engineers and workmen waving and\\nthrowing up their caps and falling into one another's arms in\\necstasies of delight.  When the excitement subsided, the\\npresident continued:\\n\\n\\\"Chairman Wetmore, of the Committee on Excavations and\\nEmbankments in Wilkesland and the Antarctic Continent, reports:\\n'Two hundred and fifty thousand square miles are now hollowed out\\nand enclosed sufficiently to hold water to an average depth of\\nfour hundred feet.  Every summer, when the basin is allowed to\\ndrain, we can, if necessary, extend our reservoir, and shall have\\nthe best season of the year for doing work until the earth has\\npermanent spring.  Though we have comparatively little water or\\ntidal power, the earth's crust is so thin at this latitude, on\\naccount of the flattening, that by sinking our tubular boilers\\nand pipes to a depth of a few thousand feet we have secured so\\nterrific a volume of superheated steam that, in connection with\\nour wind turbines, we shall have no difficulty in raising half a\\ncubic mile of water a minute to our enclosure, which is but\\nlittle above sea-level, and into which, till the pressure\\nincreases, we can fan or blow the water, so that it can be full\\nthree weeks after our longest day, or, since the present\\nunimproved arrangement gives the indigenes but one day and night\\na year, I will add the 21st day of December.\\n\\n\\\"'We shall be able to find use for much of the potential energy\\nof the water in the reservoir when we allow it to escape in June,\\nin melting some of the accumulated polar ice-cap, thereby\\ndecreasing still further the weight of this pole, in lighting and\\nwarming ourselves until we get the sun's light and heat, in\\nextending the excavations, and in charging the storage batteries\\nof the ships at this end of the line.  Everything will be ready\\nwhen you signal \\\"Raise water.\\\"'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Let me add parenthetically,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"that this means\\nof obtaining power by steam boilers sunk to a great depth is much\\nto be commended; for, though the amount of heat we can withdraw\\nis too small to have much effect, the farther towards the centre\\nour globe can be cooled the deeper will the water of the oceans\\nbe able to penetrate--since it is its conversion into steam that\\nprevents the water from working its way in farther--and the more\\ndry land we shall have.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see,\\\" the president continued, \\\"the storage capacity at the\\nsouth pole is not quite as great as at the north, because it is\\nmore difficult to excavate a basin than to close the exits of one\\nthat already exists, which is what we have done in the arctic.\\nThe work is also not so nearly complete, since it will not be\\nnecessary to use the southern reservoir for storing weight for\\nsix months, or until the south pole, which is now at its maximum\\ndeclination from the sun, is turned towards it and begins to move\\naway; then, by increasing the amount of matter there, and at the\\nsame time lightening the north pole, and reversing the process\\nevery six months, we decrease the speed at which the departing\\npole leaves the sun and at which the approaching pole advances.\\nThe north pole, we see, will be a somewhat more powerful lever\\nthan the south for working the globe to a straight position, but\\nwe may be sure that the latter, in connection with the former,\\nwill be able to hold up its end.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\[The building here fairly shook with applause, so that, had the\\narctic workers used the microphone, they might have heard in the\\nenthusiastic uproar a good counterpart of their own period.\\\\]\\n\\n\\\"I only regret,\\\" the president continued, \\\"that when we began\\nthis work the most marvellous force yet discovered--apergy--was\\nnot sufficiently understood to be utilized, for it would have\\neased our labours to the point of almost eliminating them.  But\\nwe have this consolation: it was in connection with our work that\\nits applicability was discovered, so that had we and all others\\npostponed our great undertaking on the pretext of waiting for a\\nnew force, apergy might have continued to lie dormant for\\ncenturies.  With this force, obtained by simply blending negative\\nand positive electricity with electricity of the third element or\\nstate, and charging a body sufficiently with this fluid,\\ngravitation is nullified or partly reversed, and the earth repels\\nthe body with the same or greater power than that with which it\\nstill attracts or attracted it, so that it may be suspended or\\ncaused to move away into space.  Sic itur ad astra, we may say.\\nWith this force and everlasting spring before us, what may we not\\nachieve?  We may some day be able to visit the planets, though\\nmany may say that, since the axes of most of those we have\\nconsidered are more inclined than ours, they would rather stay\\nhere.  'Blessed are they that shall inherit the earth,'\\\" he went\\non, turning a four-foot globe with its axis set vertically and at\\nright angles to a yellow globe labelled \\\"Sun\\\"; and again waxing\\neloquent, he added:  \\\"We are the instruments destined to bring\\nabout the accomplishment of that prophecy, for never in the\\nhistory of the world has man reared so splendid a monument to his\\nown genius as he will in straightening the axis of the planet.\\n\\n\\\"No one need henceforth be troubled by sudden change, and every\\nman can have perpetually the climate he desires.  Northern Europe\\nwill again luxuriate in a climate that favoured the elephants\\nthat roamed in northern Asia and Switzerland.  To produce these\\nanimals and the food they need, it is not necessary to have great\\nheat, but merely to prevent great cold, half the summer's sun\\nbeing absorbed in melting the winter's accumulation of ice.\\n\\n\\\"When the axis has reached a point at which it inclines but about\\ntwelve degrees, it will become necessary to fill the antarctic\\nreservoir in June and the Arctic Ocean in December, in order to\\ncheck the straightening, since otherwise it might get beyond the\\nperpendicular and swing the other way.  When this motion is\\ncompletely arrested, I suggest that we blow up the Aleutian Isles\\nand enlarge Bering Strait, so as to allow what corresponds to the\\nAtlantic Gulf Stream in the Pacific to enter the Arctic\\nArchipelago, which I have calculated will raise the average\\ntemperature of that entire region about thirty degrees, thereby\\nstill further increasing the amount of available land.\\n\\n\\\"Ocean currents, being the result of the prevailing winds, which\\nwill be more regular than at present, can be counted upon to\\ncontinue practically as they are.  It may not be plain to you why\\nthe trade winds do not blow towards the equator due south and\\nnorth, since the equator has much the same effect on air that a\\nstove has in the centre of a room, causing an ascending current\\ntowards the ceiling, which moves off in straight lines in all\\ndirections on reaching it, its place being taken by cold currents\\nmoving in opposite directions along the floor.  Picture to\\nyourselves the ascending currents at the equator moving off to\\nthe poles from which they came.  As they move north they are\\ncontinually coming to parts of the globe having smaller circles\\nof latitude than those they have left, and therefore not moved\\nforward as rapidly by the earth's daily rotation as the latitudes\\nnearer the equator.  The winds consequently run ahead of the\\nsurface, and so move east of north--the earth turning towards the\\neast--while the heavier colder surface currents, rushing towards\\nthe equator to take the place of the ascending column, coming\\nfrom regions where the surface whirls comparatively slowly to\\nthose where it is rotating faster, are continually left behind,\\nand so move southwest; while south of the equator a corresponding\\nmotion results.  Though this is not the most exact explanation,\\nit may serve to make the action clear.  I will add, that if any\\none prefers a colder or a warmer climate than that of the place\\nin which he lives, he need only go north or south for an hour;\\nor, if he prefers his own latitude, he can rise a few thousand\\nfeet in the air, or descend to one of the worked-out coal-mines\\nwhich are now used as sanitariums, and secure his object by a\\nslight change of altitude.  Let us speed the departure of racking\\nchanges and extremes of climate, and prepare to welcome what we\\nbelieve prevails in paradise--namely, everlasting spring.\\\"\\n\\nAppended to the address was the report of the Government\\nExamining Committee, which ran:  \\\"We have critically examined the\\nTerrestrial Axis Straightening Company's figures and\\ncalculations, also its statements involving natural philosophy,\\nphysics, and astronomy, all of which we find correct, and hereby\\napprove.\\n\\n\\\\[Signed\\\\]        \\\"For the Committee:\\n\\n```\\n           \\\"HENRY CHELMSFORD CORTLANDT,\\n\\n                       \\\"Chairman.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nThe Board of Directors having ratified the acts of its officers,\\nand passed congratulatory resolutions, the meeting adjourned sine\\ndie.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER IV.\\n```\\n\\nPROF.
