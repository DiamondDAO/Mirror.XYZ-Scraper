"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"#### Controversies and collapses\\n\\nAustin was once the home of Ross Ulbricht, creator of the infamous darknet marketplace **Silk Road**. Operating under the pseudonym “Dread Pirate Roberts” — an homage to the movie *The Princess Bride* —Ulbricht started developing the site in 2010 after returning to Austin following his graduation from Penn State. He avoided the authorities until his arrest in San Francisco in 2013.\\n\\nSilk Road allowed users to buy and sell illicit goods such as weapons and stolen credit card information, but many of the listings were for illegal drugs, all of which drew the attention of the FBI. Since his arrest and conviction, Ulbricht is currently serving two life sentences without the possibility of parole. He was found guilty of money laundering, computer hacking and conspiracy to traffic narcotics, but he still provides periodic analyses on the crypto market from prison.\\n\\n#### Notable figures in Austin and former residents\\n\\n[Tesla CEO](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/11/13/elon-musk-tesla-stock-nyycoin-mayor-blessings-mastercard-crypto-linked-credit-card-asia-pacific-hodlers-digiest-nov-7-13) and Dogecoin proponent **Elon Musk**; **Jimmy Song**, a Bitcoin developer and crypto influencer known for wearing a cowboy hat; **Nathan Nichols**, a board member of the Texas Blockchain Council; **Jim Breyer**, the venture capitalist behind Breyer Capital; **Bitcoin Frankie**, a crypto influencer and owner of Brand Besties; and **Ross Ulbricht**, creator of the now-defunct Silk Road darknet marketplace.
