"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Why focus on DEX and Lending & Borrowing on Polkadot\\n\\nDeFi is Decentralized Finance or decentralized finance, simply put financial products and services on the On-chain, to do that requires a place to transfer value between parties in the ecosystem – DEX is such a place.\\n\\nTake a look at the image below, you will see how important Dex is to DeFi on Ethereum.\\n\\nIf Dex is the first step to promote money flow on Onchain, Lending & Borrowing is the next step to help users spend more money they own (margin Trading, …).\\n\\nBoth of these areas are extremely developed on Ethereum and are the foundation for other DeFi Sectors to develop on it.\\n\\nOf course, not all ecosystems develop in the same way as Ethereum, this depends on the openness (permissionless) of that ecosystem that they are oriented to develop separately.\\n\\nAt this point, Polkadot is the ecosystem that has the most similarities with Ethereum, a Network with a high degree of decentralization, frameworks to support building Protocols and Dapps in open source mode quite a lot. There is also financial support from Polkadot's development fund. It is because of this that DeFi on Polkadot thrives both horizontally and in length.\\n\\nDEX on Polkadot\\n\\nDEX on Ethereum has two main types, AMM and Orderbook, due to some technical limitations of Ethereum and On-chain liquidity is still not too large, AMM is becoming the main DEX Model on Ethereum.\\n\\nBut with Polkadot, each Parachain is Customizable to serve a certain number of functions, so it allows the ability to combine Models together, the problem of which Model is more widely used is still unfinished because the product is not Live, Here are some outstanding projects in the DEX array in my own opinion.\\n\\nLending & Borrowing on Polkadot\\n\\nThe most widely used and successful Lending & Borrowing model today is the Lending Pool (Aave, Maker, Compound, …).\\n\\nOn Polkadot it is similar, the two projects I introduced below, both use the Lending Pool model.\\n\\nOutstanding features of the Polkadot ecosystem.\\n\\nThere are many development teams that have come to Polkadot to build their decentralized applications (Dapps). Because Polkadot is a nascent ecosystem, the cost of building Dapps is also much cheaper than other older systems like Ethereum. In addition to the cost issue, Polkadot also has other outstanding features, attracting many teams to participate in building and developing this ecosystem.\\n\\nAbility of extension\\n\\nThe first is scalability. Since Polkadot is a multi-chain technology, it allows the system to parallelize transactions on many different parachains, which makes Polkadot very impressive transaction processing speed.\\n\\nFor your understanding, we have the following example. Currently, Ethereum supports processing up to 15 transactions in 1 second, while, with a single application on Polkadot, it can handle up to 1000 transactions in 1 second. Therefore, the whole Polkadot ecosystem is capable of processing transactions at hundreds of times faster than an individual Dapps, that is, hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. With such a huge processing speed, the expansion of the Polkadot network is only a matter of time.\\n\\nInteractive abillity\\n\\nAll apps built on Polkadot can share information and functions with each other just like apps on your phone. For example, if you receive an invitation to a meeting via email, that meeting schedule can be connected to your daily calendar application for reminders. Or e-wallets (Airpay, Momo) can connect to your bank account app.\\n\\nIn addition to interoperability with Dapps on the same Polkadot ecosystem, these applications can also connect to systems of other blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ether via the Bridge. This allows tokens on two different blockchains to communicate and convert to each other, making it easier for investors to access new projects on Polkadot.\\n\\nPossibility to upgrade\\n\\nUpgrading the system and application software is necessary to optimize functionality as well as improve technology. However, for blockchain, upgrading is not easy. This typically requires splitting the native token in two, leading to community splits and often taking months to complete.\\n\\nIn the Polkadot ecosystem, it's much easier to upgrade again. Polkadot allows applications to be upgraded without splitting, to develop and adapt to new technology as quickly as possible.\\n\\nSelf-governance\\n\\nDot token holders have the right to manage the Polkadot ecosystem according to their needs or test new ideas to improve and upgrade the system. Proposals related to the development of Polkadot must be approved by the majority by voting. Polkadot also regularly collects feedback from its community to improve the ecosystem better.\\n\\nPersonalize\\n\\nPolkadot allows each individual parachain to design its own application via Substrate to fit its purpose.\",\"timestamp\":1638430098,\"title\":\"Introduction to the Polkadot ecosystem\"},\"digest\":\"TY6CNo32FPhXDeruJxIMap3hlueksstVWfSefDEKXPU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCCEea58214278B2b2058767084620a026dF20C43\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rxLLIuUzKJX8r2ew_FPi6zg6p6sXO3Bu-WYyLmoL9Bs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mQbBjzJHxXf9A3fyDTv5c-94yLlY8OI1a0t0xV8Kx2Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"QDRd-rudztzpKMALhCjqqaejHU9y1DfXgRYFfCxb9gb_58IH6W5UlY66DL_8f8ND_7mTg2GALmAwmWv0-d2H9A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa8e0c6c5cd814294069db92e5e4b6a7d435244a1dfb625b3a0fd478ead6255005e54f69ea42ed79faf3eda4da316b9c3e129edb915289384831bd95494f698211c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rxLLIuUzKJX8r2ew_FPi6zg6p6sXO3Bu-WYyLmoL9Bs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mQbBjzJHxXf9A3fyDTv5c-94yLlY8OI1a0t0xV8Kx2Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TY6CNo32FPhXDeruJxIMap3hlueksstVWfSefDEKXPU\"}"
