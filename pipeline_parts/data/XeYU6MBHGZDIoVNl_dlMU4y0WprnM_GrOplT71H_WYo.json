Somewhere in UAE and US joint operation military air force base.***\\n\\nIn times of trouble, many used to allegorize that, at first, the sun was overshadowed by the dark stormy cloud. Then, the roaring thunder with its dazzling lightning, and followed by the instant heavy rainfall. Afterward, the dark cloud breaks into smaller pieces as rays of sunlight penetrate from the sky above straight to the ground below. Soon after that, the gloomy day turns bright and sunny again. Like Monk, General Perry and Davis are also seeking a Zen moment amidst the storm. But, oh well, after they recently ran like hell to Eagle-One parking lot in trying to save their lives from the incoming horde of undead and failed miserably, neither Davis, General Perry, nor Monk knows at which part of the allegory they are fit right now? Has the dark cloud of monsters just come or passed? Or has the ray of sunlight recently penetrated the dark cloud in a middle of a heavy storm?\\n\\nThe only thing the three men are sure of right now is that the sun is not yet shining on the horizon because a horde of monsters is still blocking their way from reaching Eagle-One. Stephen is on Eagle-Two dropping several deadly rounds of 30mm bullets and 105mm heavy cannon shells from the sky. And now, they keep hearing a weird horn coming from a military jeep speeding fast towards them.\\n\\nAs soon as the three 105mm, HCAN shells exploded not far from where they are pinned down by the horde of undead, Davis and General Perry instantaneously stand up and begin to shoot the closest incoming undead that keeps walking towards them. While after hearing the horn and seeing the incoming Oshkosh JLTV (Joint Light Tactical Vehicle) military jeep, Monk immediately turns his gun towards the incoming military jeep since he does not know who drives it or what the intention is? The military jeep is still cruising and is less than one hundred meters away, yet it doesn't reduce its speed.\\n\\nPrepare and cautious at the same time, Monk quickly fires a warning shot to the vehicle, and it hits one of the Oshkosh headlights to alert whoever is driving the jeep, but the jeep is not slowing down. Monk knows that his Glock 17 bullet is no match to the JLTV thick steel armor, but he needs to be sure whoever drives the jeep is not trying to run them down. On the other hand, Monk also thinks the jeep is, somehow, not a threat because if it does, Stephen on Eagle-Two will already spot it, and it may not hesitate to blast the vehicle into smithereens. Yet, in his situation, he takes no chances. Suddenly, the driver speaks using the Public Address system (PA system) from inside the military jeep!\\n\\n“Stop shooting! This is Hydra! Run to the jeep!”\\n\\nThe JLTV came from the Southern part, which is the farthest side of the military base, and there is nothing there except runways. While beyond that is just the vast desert of the Arabian Peninsula.\\n\\nMonk: “General! It’s …”\\n\\nGeneral Perry: “It’s Hydra! Run to the jeep!”\\n\\nBefore Monk could finish his sentence, General Perry also heard Hydra's voice coming from the PA system of the JLTV and told them to make a run for it to the jeep!\\n\\nThe horde of the undead keeps closing in from almost every direction except the Southern part where the jeep came.\\n\\n“Duff! Duff! Duff!” (A firing sound from the 105mm HCAN)\\n\\n“Ratatatattata!” (A firing sound from 25mm GAU-12/U gattling gun)\\n\\nDavis: “Oh Shit! Incoming!”\\n\\nGeneral Perry, Monk, and Davis immediately lower their bodies like before to a squat position. Several seconds later, the three shells exploded some fifty-five meters away, and that blast radius was way too close for the three men. Four undead were also thrown by the powerful blast and fell some three to five meters away from Davis.\\n\\nMonk: “Davis! Behind you!\\n\\n“Bang! Bang! Click! Click! Click!”\\n\\nDavis is surprised and terrified by the sudden appearance of the human-like monster near him, and he accidentally falls on his back. He fired twice precisely at the undead forehead and face, but he ran out of bullets, and the rest of the three monsters flown by the heavy cannon blast are aggressively coming towards him. As a trained spec op with hundreds of hours of experience on the battlefields, Davis never once runs out of bullets when using his gun. Davis is a meticulous person. He always counts how many shots he fires, steps, or distances he takes. But tonight, the undead make Davis and the two other professional soldiers look like freshly graduated rookie police officers from and on their first field duty.\\n\\nPanic and traumatized by what happened, Davis quickly dropped the used bullet magazine by pressing the button using his right thumb while holding the gun. He did it before reaching the new ones using his left hand from the pouch on his left waistband, which is not how any well-trained spec op will do when doing a speed or tactical reload.\\n\\nThankfully, Monk and General Perry quickly shoot the three undead close to Davis as he still lay on the ground after falling on his back and out of ammo. Monk and General Perry reacted quickly and put three holes on each of the three undead heads. One of the undead drop-dead near Davis.\\n\\n“FUCK!” Davis was angry and disappointed because he did not respond or perform as he should have, like a well-trained and experienced spec op. He knew, if it not for Monk and General Perry saving his life, he would already become a snack for the undead by now.\\n\\nThe two men quickly help Davis to stand up. Once Davis is back on his feet, he reloads his handgun with lightning speed which he usually does in less than one second.\\n\\nDavis immediately shoots the nearest incoming undead with precision when Monk and General Perry take turns in speed reloading their gun.\\n\\n“Move in, now!” says Hydra from inside the JLTV using the PA system again, and then she presses the break and makes a sudden left turn which drifts the JLTV slightly before reaching a stop around fifteen to twenty meters away from the three men.\\n\\nHydra immediately exits the JLTV carrying a modular assault rifle, FN SCAR, and a Remington 870 tactical shotgun, commonly used by the US Special Operations Forces (SOF). She straps the tactical shotgun on her left shoulder while holding the FN SCAR with both hands. She walks at gunpoint by going through the rear of the JLTV to reach the other side and begin to shoot with lethal precision toward any incoming undead near General Perry, Monk, Davis, and the JLTV by using the FN SCAR to prevent the undead from besieging them from all sides.\\n\\n“Ratatatatataat!”\\n\\nInside her mind, she also hopes the road heading south to the edge of the runway is clear from being blocked by the horde of undead.\\n\\nHydra: “General! Get in the JLTV, now! I can handle this with the boys.”\\n\\nMonk and Davis hear what Hydra just shouted to General Perry, and the two men see how she handles the FN SCAR. At that point, they know Hydra is not some ordinary civilian scientist or field agent working as a “part-time” consultant for the Department of Defence (DoD).\\n\\nGeneral Perry is following Hydra's order and slowly retreats to the JLTV until he reaches her. He speeds reload his Glock 17 and says to Hydra, “Something just came up. This is not just a virus, Hydra. We need to get out of here, fast!”\\n\\nHydra replies: “Yes, Sir! I know…” Then she quickly gives the shotgun to General Perry and says, “Sir, pass this to them!”\\n\\nDavis and Monk are also retreating, and they are halfway to the JLTV when they both hear General Perry shouts to one of them, “Davis!”\\n\\nDavis immediately responds and looks at General Perry. He sees General Perry carrying a tactical shotgun and is giving a sign for him to catch it.\\n\\n“Catch!” says General Perry as he throws the Remington 870 to him.\\n\\nDavis feels blessed by the gift, and he quickly put away his Glock 17 back to the side holster on his waist and catches the tactical shotgun just on time from General Perry.\\n\\nWithout further ado... Davis pumps the Remington 870 tactical shotgun and begins sending the three-and-a-half-inch size buckshot shells to land on the undead faces.\\n\\nDavis is standing ten meters away from the closest incoming undead. So he does not blast one undead at a time but two or even three heads of the undead simultaneously. Satisfy with the result and having some spare time, he stops shooting and quickly takes the Glock 17 from the side holster using his right hand and gives the handgun to Monk.\\n\\nOn most battlefields, Monk and Davis are like one mind in two separate bodies. They just responded to each other actions like two professional jugglers on a battlefield throwing and catching at the same time while bullets are flying around.\\n\\nBy holding the two Glock 17 on each hand, Monk begins shooting at the incoming undead, and it was a modern-day wild west indeed. Each bullet made a direct hit on the undead heads. The undead falls to the ground like steel targets. Davis, on the other hand, makes the undead heads explode as if he is shooting explosive targets.\\n\\n“Spectacular!” Hydra mumbles as she sees the two men in real-life combat action. She feels astonished with Davis and Monk's rhyme cooperation in the line of fire. Now she also knows why General Perry is still well and alive because he was in good hands.\\n\\nDavis and Monk finally reach the JLTV and shout “Move! Move!” telling General Perry and Hydra to quickly enter the JLTV.\\n\\nGeneral Perry shouts back and promptly says, “Davis, drive! Monk, take the CROWS! Let’s move out!”\\n\\nThe JLTV is equipped with an M153 CROWS II system (Common Remotely Operated Weapon Station). The CROWS system provides a gunner with the ability to acquire and engage targets while inside a vehicle. The sight includes a daylight video camera, a thermal camera, and an eye-safe laser rangefinder. It is also furnished with a fully integrated fire control system that provides ballistic correction. The CROWS II system can mount various types of machine guns, ranging from 7.62mm, 12.7mm, or in the case of what Monk will take control of the JLTV armament is the 30 mm M230 chaingun which is commonly mounted on an AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.\\n\\nHydra and the three men finally enter the JLTV and without delay, Davis steps on the gas and leaves what could almost become a slaughterhouse for the three men if Hydra didn’t show up just on time. General Perry sits beside Davis at the front seat while Hydra and Monk take the rear. Hydra taps Davis's shoulder twice and says, “Head South to the edge of runway number four!”\\n\\n“Yes, Ma’am.” Says Davis, responding to Hydra’s order.\\n\\nShe quickly switches back ON her Combat Net Radio (CNR) and makes immediate contact with Lieutenant Stephen on board Eagle-Two.\\n\\nHydra: “Eagle-two, Eagle-two, this is Aurora-One. Respond, over.”\\n\\nStephen: “Aurora-One, this is Eagle-Two. The ground is FUBAR. I repeat, the ground is FUBAR. They are everywhere! Break. Dubai city is covered with thick mist and is a fucking war zone down there, we detected explosions and fires everywhere. Break. What’s your 10-20?”\\n\\nHydra: “Eagle-two, this is Aurora-One, the Unicorn is safe and secure… with a pair of Eagle-One boys. Break. Aurora-One Oscar-Mike south to the nest. Break. Keep the runway clear. ETA in five minutes. Over and out.”\\n\\nStephen: “Aurora-One, this is Eagle-Two. Lima-Charlie. Break. Your beacon is detected and you may proceed. Break. Eagle-Two is standing by.”\\n\\nThe UAE-US joint military air force base near Dubai in the United Arab Emirates has four long runways and is considered to be one of the largest in the Middle East. The US military air force base itself is just one-third of the whole area which is divided into three independent sections. Each section is connected using roads and fields. If seen from above, the US military airbase has alternative roads within the base that is connected with the Dubai International Airport (DXB), and also a military air force base belonging to the UAE Air Force. The whole facilities are so massive and vast, it has the size of a medium city.\\n\\nAs of now, the JLTV cruises a dark road in uncertain situations and with one hundred percent certainty, an abandoned military base. A place that was once known as the most protected and secure US military air force base in the Middle East is now like a huge battle zone and an empty graveyard.\\n\\n![(Illustration 57)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WxYh7yBRztwYRb9I-c5YH.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\nFrom inside the JLTV rear camera view, they can see a huge cloud of mist is slowly following them from behind. Now, they cannot even see the entrance area or the Eastern side of the military base where Monk, Davis, and General Perry run away from. The military base is slowly swallowed by the mist. Other than huge flashes of blazing fires mixed with smoke coming from inside the mist, no one knows what truly happens inside the thick mist.\\n\\nLike driving inside a misty war zone but inside the enemy territory, Davis took precautions by using the low headlights to see the road ahead which is now is becoming limited as the soft and thin mist begin to build up in some parts of the roads. He is more dependent on Monk telling him where to go, especially if there are any hostile movements nearby. Sitting at the rear, Monk is busy on the JLTV monitor, he is scanning the safest and fastest route heading south to the edge of the military base runway where the airplanes and the last remaining crew are waiting.\\n\\nAfter finished talking to Eagle-Two, Hydra says to General Perry.\\n\\nHydra: “I am sorry I have borrowed the JLTV earlier, General Perry but as we left the briefing room, we were informed that a massive mist was already heading to the military base. We immediately ordered the last transport C5 Galaxy to airborne. Eagle-One, Doctor Jim, and Spartacus are waiting for us on the plane at the edge of the runway. General, I don’t think this is just a virus pandemic but it has something to do with the trees that are appearing everywhere and the mist. General, I think monsters are walking inside the mist…”\\n\\nGeneral Perry interrupts Hydra, saying, “Huge monster, Hydra. We saw it too! Look, Hydra! Before you came, we saw the infected and also a huge monster reaching three meters in height is also walking with them. It was neither a human nor likely, a mutation. It must have come from somewhere else but certainly not of this planet. At this point, I still don’t know what to conclude but the spreading virus, the trees, the mist, and the monsters… those things are enough for me to say right now that we are being invaded, except for the sudden loss of electricity which I think is a manmade computer virus…”\\n\\nDavis interrupts General Perry and Hydra's conversations. He says, “What are you saying, Sir?”\\n\\nHydra: “Just stay focused on the road, Officer!”\\n\\nSuddenly, there is a moment of tense, and silence inside the JLTV. Davis felt uncomfortable with Hydra’s words and raises his eyebrows while viewing the rear mirror. Monk felt the same as Davis, and he thinks what Hydra just said to show who’s in charge is unnecessary, especially when a high-rank Officer like General Perry is already present inside the vehicle.\\n\\nGeneral Perry immediately steps in to ease the tensions. He says, “Everyone just calms down! Hydra, I want you to meet Officer Davis and Officer Monk. They are my classified US Military assets inside the Special Operations Forces. Gentlemen, this is Hydra, she also works for…”\\n\\nWhile General Perry is still making an introductory conversation, Monk who is still monitoring the road, and the surroundings using the thermal vision suddenly shouts to Davis.\\n\\nMonk: “Davis! We got huge crowd heading southeast half click ahead!”\\n\\nDavis: “O hell… Here goes nothing!”\\n\\nDavis is not the only one who is tense tonight, as the rest of the three other officers inside the JLTV also beginning to realize that their way to reach the edge of runway number four is becoming like the song lyric from The Eagle, titled Hotel California. “You can check out anytime you like, but you can never leave…”\\n\\n**(To be continued)**\",\"timestamp\":1637248324,\"title\":\"Survivor in the mist\"},\"digest\":\"n_6WSBaOxARdvr4gxCa_B0xOqn5Eij8gqpI2W9bv6J4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc1C41e3606bF2756c09c95132F528012be17f724\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wg8oJqWRiHRLP3Zz1zzhuzNkcKThvoK_fay_6PwYC7c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e-RLvtHWPxywJxIy7kXPOEx9waDfbm-Wq7pLpqnWQbM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GDlf6VZvtT0twmhLDEXZ5cqH1_bWCGRE83J-YQOlapvIVd2W-kPPORcZ4-lhV_OFSvpdzJ4aWr0ghEI1juP7EQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x000d3aaaafb85cc19410044dcabab9cbfe7a2c74fb1b77d8d5b9e7acff504300161586b40d2f7cd0068b7dd12204d8fa59eb55ed4c01cbaed11c632e434bc9011c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wg8oJqWRiHRLP3Zz1zzhuzNkcKThvoK_fay_6PwYC7c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e-RLvtHWPxywJxIy7kXPOEx9waDfbm-Wq7pLpqnWQbM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EipZorgKFt1J7ldk6uOH8MKA8rABKj6fAJb5UpchFF8\"}"
