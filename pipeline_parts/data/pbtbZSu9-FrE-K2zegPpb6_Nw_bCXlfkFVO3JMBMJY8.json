"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Today Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™m joining the [Rainbow.me](https://rainbow.me) team as their **content creator & community manager.**\\n\\nI had been interviewing at traditional tech companies the past few weeks and received several offers, but none of them felt right for me. They didn't excite me like the projects I was seeing in the Ethereum space. \\n\\nI decided to take a risk, turn down my offers, and pursue a position within crypto instead. I already had relationships in the industry because I was involved as a passionate hobbyist, so I tweeted that I was open for work:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/jacksondame/status/1386714083970494467?s=20\\n\\nWithin days I had 7-8 job interviews and 3 offers at some amazing companies!\\n\\nRainbow didnâ€™t actually have any jobs posted, so I decided to DM co-founder Mike Demarais on Twitter to let him know I wanted to join their team. We had been following each other for a few months, so he knew how much I loved their app.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/mikedemarais/status/1389741840048480257?s=20\\n\\n## Why Rainbow ðŸŒˆ\\n\\nIâ€™m joining Rainbow because itâ€™s my favorite Ethereum app. I believe in the product personally, and I use it everyday. Itâ€™s leading the industry in both user experience and design, and itâ€™s great for all skill levels. \\n\\nRainbow also holds a special place in my heart. I used it to buy my first Ether, rescue my first MoonCat, and mint my first NFT. It was my gateway into crypto and remains my daily driver.\\n\\nNon-custodial wallets like Rainbow are an essential part of the Web3 experience, and they are used for interacting with almost every part of the [Ethereum ecosystem](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/). They can sometimes be difficult for new people to understand and get used to though, so I'm excited to play a pivotal role in helping people learn and grow.\\n\\nCrypto wallets are also extremely fascinating to me, and I'm intrigued by the potential they have to change how we interact with the world around us in the coming decades.\\n\\nIâ€™ll be getting started immediately, so be sure to follow [the Rainbow Twitter account](https://twitter.com/rainbowdotme), [download the app](https://rainbow.me), and be on the lookout for lots of exciting things coming up!\\n\\nP.S. If you're already using MetaMask or another Ethereum wallet, you can use Rainbow with it at the same time:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/rainbowdotme/status/1390144046178443266?s=20\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5ff68c5e-803a-4c30-9b9b-ac5cec2f4aa2.png?height=630&width=1200)\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1620638098,\"title\":\"Iâ€™m Joining the Team at Rainbow ðŸŒˆ \",\"publication\":\"dame\"},\"digest\":\"5e7fsCF5M5ZfGyuMgeOzxw554OjMjExfrMRBQ5Xr2qg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xeBIoI_O3lWhF7-y8M_8FrAVGlWZlSC2k_oLNOG617M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EhDow1DxkCJfgMkmEOck5LuGSsguOXzv3tLhiWSsSmY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"V8veE37ERrqoZQpKJnhavYpOQXXoYy5lqBYDlQe4LbDQZDszN1p_E1oUhEYKw16dc9P04b5os9OOjaPMHLfC1Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x70bbc25eca7eb159dc08729c61b447232972c4c34403be4bfb087bd4021249a146f435b54fc6231f0ddbba400a539e3081e9bdd356ee1af33f907f0b49e1a1521c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on dame.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xeBIoI_O3lWhF7-y8M_8FrAVGlWZlSC2k_oLNOG617M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EhDow1DxkCJfgMkmEOck5LuGSsguOXzv3tLhiWSsSmY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lkysvdCNUIqvEpI8LP8Bz1FZH-ieyDkSZSEaKrXZZeA\"}"
