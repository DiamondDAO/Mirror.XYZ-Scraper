"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We are fucked. We are Metafucked. \\n\\nThe Metaverse was supposed to be an escape from reality. An alternate universe where you could be and do anything you wanted, unencumbered by identity, the past or the laws of physics.\\n\\nThe Metaverse, where you could create worlds, identities, stories and roam freely for hours or days or the rest of your life.\\n\\nThe Metaverse was described as dreamlike, a fantasyland, the imagination come to life and eventually, the Metaverse would be where our minds would meld into perfect synergy as the Singularity. We would never be forgotten and could live forever. \\n\\nThe Metaverse, where our digital twin or avatar could replicate a thousand times and be and do anything. \\n\\nBut what got replicated...our jobs. We now all have digital twins of our jobs and are working double time in dual space. \\n\\nSure, this digital twin of our universe is immersive, social, expansive, evolving, shared, economic, and working towards being civil and safe. Just like IRL.\\n\\nBut, the maintenance alone is overwhelming. In the Metaverse, we have to organize our files, clean out our storage, upgrade our hardware and software, keep up with friends and family on social media, share important events, and network on Linkedin.\\n\\nAnd we can’t quit any of this in the real world.\\n\\nYou still have to maintain your physical body, house, children, pets, cars etc…, but now we are building full digital worlds replete with all the same things. No wonder we are all stressed and overworked. We have double the duties. \\n\\nThe luckiest of us do less in the real world to give us time to advance in the Metaverse. We are building our digital wallets, real estate, digital stores, and homes all while sitting at home also doing the laundry, cooking, cleaning, and waiting for the AC repair person. \\n\\nThis is the ultimate “go west young man” and all the privileges in the real world seem to also be replicating themselves.\\n\\nSo maybe we are not truly metafucked, but we do need to work even harder to establish a healthy balance of work, play and rest because what’s possible is expanding exponentially as is what can be missed out on. \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1633795287,\"title\":\"The Metafauxc\"},\"digest\":\"yLJM9WeqZgS1AFDVgM29BqvZhDP-4RSmLswMfZmffKo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3F0Af7Ee5B1a12686AD3ad4Aa4F1553fDCe68e96\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"C86dMfZyKCjaoeMjEd5cJxF5T5iMCuMvUYz6jFshGQs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y61zXniUoH090rBeZ-QwVSS8gn86Sse0yU389lr1oCs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ycCH_rUVxoU2i9mkIYlRoAPA0ObHBme-lDELuOY-V-YT4mkG3q1TXqFafCRteLcuBScu6hhinFVwSNWelzVnxw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdef6cabe5a8e8a77b3d0eae5ff46f3ce6e86d31a480d8111ca8f151ff9124fbd3c3a4dcf6a31a5342eac9d3626e70378c3dd833483add7bb28682338b7ed324c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"C86dMfZyKCjaoeMjEd5cJxF5T5iMCuMvUYz6jFshGQs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y61zXniUoH090rBeZ-QwVSS8gn86Sse0yU389lr1oCs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yLJM9WeqZgS1AFDVgM29BqvZhDP-4RSmLswMfZmffKo\"}"
