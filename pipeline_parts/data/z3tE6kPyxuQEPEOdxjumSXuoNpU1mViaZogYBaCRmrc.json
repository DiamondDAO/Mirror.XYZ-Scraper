Go claim your $UDAO tokens [here](https://usdtdao.org/).\\n\\n## UDAO Token and DAO Overview\\n\\nUSDT DAO has launched $UDAO, the world’s first governance token to reward holders of USDT.\\n\\nUSDT is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency whose tokens in circulation are backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, making it a stablecoin with a price pegged to USD $1.00. [$USDT](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tether/) is by far the largest stablecoin with a total circulating supply of **$78,344,882,507** and over [4,247,320 holders](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#balances) (ERC-20).\\n\\nThe next frontier in computing, which will take shape this decade, is building apps on programmable blockchains. Programmable blockchains are interesting for the same reason that innovation on smartphones spiked after opening up development to third parties via app stores. We are now seeing waves of brilliant, creative people building new products and services on top of blockchains that are disrupting industries and reaching mainstream adoption. DeFi was the first wave of blockchain killer apps that broke out about a year ago, followed by NFTs and crypto gaming experiences this year. What comes next is hard to predict, we aim for **USDT DAO to have an enormous impact on the adoption of web3 products.**\\n\\nUSDT DAO is an internet-native, global collective that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals. $UDAO, an ERC-20 governance token is a powerful new initiative to organizing the largest stablecoin community and aligning incentives to funnel creative energy, and reach an impactful outcome. **Imagine what can happen if every USDT holder will claim and hold $UDAO.**\\n\\nUSDT DAO is about bottom-up innovation and community building, from which new ideas can be incubated and scaled. The core components of $UDAO are decentralized and self-running.\\n\\n**We believe that truly disruptive innovations often look like toys at the outset, and emerge when groups of smart people get together and collaborate on issues they’re passionate about.**\\n\\nIt’s amazing what we are seeing today. Talented engineers with only an internet connection are contributing to the most important blockchain infrastructure, regardless of their age, gender, or pedigree.\\n\\nBy aligning the incentives of USDT holders, USDT DAO is enabling a different kind of renaissance for the next evolution of a stablecoin community.\\n\\n## UDAO Token Distribution\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/n8REg5h81WCacsZweAUY7.png?height=633&width=1103)\\n\\nThere is a total supply of 999,990,000,000,000 $UDAO tokens, and the distribution is as follows:\\n\\n* 50% airdropped to  4,266,937 (<https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#balances>) eligible wallets according to the USDT DAO formula listed below, rewarding all USDT ERC-20 holders (no minimum requirement) based on their balance on a snapshot ending at block 13951654 (January 6, 2022)\\n* 30% to the USDT DAO treasury\\n* 10% to USDT DAO contributors (100 individuals and groups, plus hundreds of Twitter and Telegram users)\\n* 10% allocated for the liquidity incentive program\\n\\n## Airdrop to USDT holders\\n\\n50% of the total supply is allocated for the $UDAO airdrop.
