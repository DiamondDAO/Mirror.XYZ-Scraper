Flux (FLUX)\\n\\nAlthough [Flux](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zel/) is the smallest cryptocurrency on our list, its network should not be overlooked.\\n\\nFlux is set to become one of the most popular cryptos shortly as the Web 3.0 phenomenon becomes more ubiquitous.\\n\\nWith its claim to be “*Amazon (AMZN) Online Services for blockchain,*” it is capable of taking on any web service titan.\\n\\nWhile AWS provides software-as-a-service (SaaS), Flux provides blockchain-as-a-service to compete with AWS (BaaS).\\n\\nFrom a performance standpoint, the changes are negligible.\\n\\nWhile cloud computing and distributed public ledgers are complementary, BaaS technologies enable customers to leverage the advantages of both to their benefit.\\n\\nUsing Flux’s FluxOS, you can operate oracles, host servers, and store data, no matter how secret, much as AWS does for the vast majority of the internet.\\n\\nIn the end, however, it promises to be a trustworthy source of information.\\n\\nTo keep the network operating, FluxNodes may be used.\\n\\nThrough the geographic identification of FluxNode operators throughout the globe, users may be linked to the quickest nodes possible while using BaaS services provided by nodes.\\n\\nEven if you don’t use the internet, you’ve heard about the recent AWS failures. AWS has had two outages in December.\\n\\nMany of the most popular social networking and e-commerce sites, as well as online gaming servers, were unavailable during these disruptions.\\n\\nWhen Flux is widely adopted, these outages will be a thing of the past, due to a large number of FluxNode operators.\\n\\n> Also, See: [A Must-Read Review: Is Victory Crypto Legit or a Scam](https://asedeyhotnaija.com/a-must-read-review-is-victory-crypto-legit-or-a-scam/)\\n\\n## 2. Ripple (XRP)\\n\\nThroughout 2021, [Ripple](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/) was dealt a poor hand. Trading of Ripple on US-based exchanges has been blocked by a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\n\\nWithout this barrier, the litigation scares away prospective investors who don’t want to invest in a firm that is in trouble.\\n\\nHowever, some people are quite enthusiastic about Ripple because they believe it will be the future of international money transfers.\\n\\nRipple, on the other hand, maybe in a position to make up for the lost time when this litigation is over in 2022.\\n\\nIn the blink of an eye, Ripple users may conduct international money transfers by converting fiat to XRP, transferring that XRP, and having the receiver convert it into the fiat of their choosing.\\n\\nUsing Ripple, users can perform international money transactions.\\n\\nThe network’s XRP token will play a significant role in dethroning the current world of international wire transactions.\\n\\nAs a result of Ripple’s legal battles, the sector has lost a large portion of its spectacular gains this year.\\n\\n81 cents is a significant increase from the 22 cents it started the year with.\\n\\nHowever, would XRP have been able to achieve profits of 100 percent or perhaps 1,000 percent?\\n\\nWe’ll never know for sure.\\n\\nHowever, Ripple continues to keep investors informed, even organizing a conference last month. And now, it hopes to bring the SEC complaint to an end.\\n\\nThe SEC’s deliberative process privilege has given the network the upper hand, as the court required the SEC to produce a letter explaining the material it retains secret (DPP).\\n\\nHowever, if it cannot, Ripple may be able to walk out of the courts triumphant sooner rather than later, which may bring a price explosion with it.\\n\\n> Also, See: [The Basics of Cryptocurrency and Investing](https://asedeyhotnaija.com/the-basics-of-cryptocurrency-and-investing/)\\n\\n## 3. Solana (SOL)\\n\\n[Solana](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/solana/) will be a major winner in 2021.\\n\\nIn early January, when the SOL currency was trading at $1.40, individuals who invested in now sitting on a 13,000 percent return at $183.10.\\n\\nAs a result of a variety of factors, such as volatile market movements or a successful excursion into non-fungible tokens, this boom has occurred (NFTs).\\n\\nRather, Solana’s position to challenge Ethereum (ETH) as the world’s leading blockchain network is the driving force behind this open-source DApp playground.\\n\\nThe scalability of Solana is its greatest advantage.\\n\\nThere is little doubt that the number of data transactions on blockchains will increase as the technology becomes more widely used.\\n\\nCertain networks can just handle higher transaction volumes better than others.\\n\\nOne such network is Solana’s, and it is taking advantage of this rising popularity.\\n\\nWhat about Ethereum’s recent increase in gas fees? For a simple trade, gas expenses on Ethereum climbed as high as $50 earlier this year.\\n\\nEthereum users are becoming more frustrated by the 2,300% increase in fees, leading some to migrate to the Solana network.\\n\\nAs many as 50,000 transactions per second are possible using Solana, which claims rates of less than one penny for these transactions.\\n\\nThe Merge update in Ethereum is aimed at increasing scalability, however, this is still a long way off.\\n\\nUntil at least the summer of 2022, the network will not be making a major upgrade to its proof-of-stake system.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Solana continues to grow in both size and market value.\\n\\nAfter 500,000 new members joined the network in January, SOL’s market value has surpassed $100 billion.\\n\\n> Also, See: [Finally Crypto Ads on Facebook and Instagram!](https://asedeyhotnaija.com/finally-crypto-ads-on-facebook-and-instagram/)\\n\\n## 4. Polygon (MATIC)\\n\\n[Polygon](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/) is a network designed to keep the blockchain business running smoothly.\\n\\nScalability concerns have arisen in the scalability game Solana as well as other huge networks that are adopting this new technology, such as the proof-of-work Ethereum network.\\n\\nLayer-2 scaling is Polygon’s attempt to avoid future bottlenecks.\\n\\nThe Ethereum network is the primary focus of Polygon’s design.\\n\\nA layer on top of Ethereum is how it does this.\\n\\nPolygon allows users to move their Ethereum transactions to the Polygon chain.\\n\\nTraffic on the main network is reduced as a result of using this service.\\n\\nPolygon can also provide extremely reduced transaction costs to its consumers as a result of this.\\n\\nLayer-2 solutions allow users to transfer transactional data across chains in a variety of ways.\\n\\nPolygon has ten distinct tools for you to use to do this.\\n\\nPolygon Zero, a zero-knowledge roll-up technique, was recently introduced to the network, making it easy to transfer data across networks with little energy consumption.\\n\\n> Also, See: [Why should I invest in Bitcoin?](https://asedeyhotnaija.com/why-should-i-invest-in-bitcoin/)\\n\\n## 5. Decentraland (MANA)\\n\\nIf you think about it, the metaverse is just a virtual place where people can do a lot of things they can do in real life play games, hang out with friends, watch live music, and so on.\\n\\nThen then, it’s a field that is backed by both the blockchain industry as well as Big Tech.\\n\\nIf you look at the Facebook makeover to Meta Platforms (FB) as evidence, you can be certain that the sector is here to stay.\\n\\nThe company’s market value is approaching $1 trillion, and its history has produced movies about its origins.\\n\\nIn light of this, the [MANA](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/decentraland/) token from Decentraland is a cryptocurrency to keep an eye on in the new year.\\n\\nEven though the metaverse has a lot of Silicon Valley support, many people wish to see it decentralized.\\n\\nRather than Meta becoming involved in virtual reality, they want it to be run by and for the people. Investors in Decentraland are leading the charge.\\n\\nAnyone is welcome to join Decentraland’s sandbox world, which is brimming with activities, on a blockchain-based metaverse.\\n\\nIt is possible to acquire a piece of land, develop it, and invite one’s friends over to spend time in the space.\\n\\nIf they choose, they may go online and play games, or they can go shopping in the virtual world. As long as they’re at home, they can do all of these things.\\n\\nThere’s also a lot of support for MANA from organizations like Sotheby’s and several artists who played at the network’s inaugural music event.\\n\\n> Also, See: [How to Make Money with Bitcoin for Beginners in 2022](https://asedeyhotnaija.com/how-to-make-money-with-bitcoin-for-beginners-in-2022/)\\n\\n## As a Wrap-Up\\n\\nAs a result, if investors want their cryptocurrency investments to continue to be winners in the next year, they need to be more discriminating.\\n\\nA year from now we’re going to need something better than arbitrage tokens, stores of value, and meme currencies.\\n\\nThese currencies and tokens are going to be able to maintain their heads above water and then some because of their use and rising tech trends.\\n\\n> Join Coinmonks [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/coincodecap) and [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/coinmonks/videos) learn about crypto trading and investing\\n\\n## Also, Read\\n\\n*   [Binance vs Bitstamp](https://blog.coincodecap.com/binance-vs-bitstamp) | [Bitpanda vs Coinbase vs Coinsbit](https://blog.coincodecap.com/bitpanda-coinbase-coinsbit)\\n*   [How to buy Ripple (XRP)](https://blog.coincodecap.com/buy-ripple-india) | [Best Crypto Exchanges in Africa](https://blog.coincodecap.com/crypto-exchange-africa)\\n*   [Best Crypto Exchanges in Africa](https://blog.coincodecap.com/crypto-exchange-africa) | [Hoo Exchange Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/hoo-exchange-review)\\n*   [eToro vs Robinhood](https://blog.coincodecap.com/etoro-robinhood) | [MoonXBT vs Bybit vs Bityard](https://blog.coincodecap.com/bybit-bityard-moonxbt)\\n*   [Stormgain Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/stormgain-review) | [Bexplus Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/bexplus-review) | [Binance vs Bittrex](https://blog.coincodecap.com/binance-vs-bittrex)\\n*   [Bookmap Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/bookmap-review-2021-best-trading-software) | [5 Best Crypto Exchanges in the USA](https://blog.coincodecap.com/crypto-exchange-usa)\\n*   [How to trade Futures on FTX Exchange](https://blog.coincodecap.com/ftx-futures-trading) | [OKEx vs Binance](https://blog.coincodecap.com/okex-vs-binance)\\n*   [How to Buy Domain Name on Unstoppable Domains?](https://blog.coincodecap.com/buy-domain-on-unstoppable-domains)\\n*   [Crypto Tax in India](https://blog.coincodecap.com/crypto-tax-india) | [altFINS Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/altfins-review) | [Prokey Review](https://medium.com/coinmonks/prokey-review-26611173c13c)\\n*   [Blockfi vs Coinbase](https://blog.coincodecap.com/blockfi-vs-coinbase) | [BitKan Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/bitkan-review) | [Binance Review](https://medium.com/coinmonks/binance-review-ee10d3bf3b6e)\\n*   [Coldcard Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/coldcard-review) | [BOXtradEX Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/boxtradex-review) | [A Guide to Uniswap](https://blog.coincodecap.com/uniswap)\\n*   [5 Best Crypto Exchanges in UAE](https://blog.coincodecap.com/best-crypto-exchanges-in-uae) | [SimpleSwap Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/simpleswap-review)\\n*   [7 Best Ways to buy Dogecoin](https://blog.coincodecap.com/ways-to-buy-dogecoin) | [ZebPay Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/zebpay-review)\\n*   [iTop VPN Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/itop-vpn-review) | [Mandala Exchange Review](https://blog.coincodecap.com/mandala-exchange-review)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641270137,\"title\":\"5 Cryptocurrencies That Will Soar in 2022 - Coinmonks - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"QxVUVqK84J7WMrOZ9u2XCkaarPqgOLMcXKQH22ANH9I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA4Cc3fB0c8F0E1dbDFfFEcdf61103777bd219089\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3cuDnFIEYYpHJjl9IgRRvv10hRlwH3KM0JhwoS4_t78\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aqVivevIgehR71ZpuOaerkARhm7-0jf7mT1Yd3v40fE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LdW8z_qVPw0-yoQfSRmMQifscfSiCOVog-dqiiLezdQ04xybfwMyOfckQ6pS16l-orcMF8gn0G4nU2FOo7UliA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb79a61b7a5e2a83af437ab6af21ba060c9029b9871d24cadf4e7e8d08e6cc1160ccd0d726ac2927caaec6126cb1c4722b1e3a65bdc7fa009ebf9414e51f9c8d91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3cuDnFIEYYpHJjl9IgRRvv10hRlwH3KM0JhwoS4_t78\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"aqVivevIgehR71ZpuOaerkARhm7-0jf7mT1Yd3v40fE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QxVUVqK84J7WMrOZ9u2XCkaarPqgOLMcXKQH22ANH9I\"}"
