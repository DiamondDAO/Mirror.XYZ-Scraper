"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2902 \\n \\\"The problem with the powerful is not that they're fallible, despite their resources, but when they don't know it or care. That's when everything and everyone is ripe for ruin.\\\"\\n\\n2X21 minus 19, Asteroid Belt, onboard the Magpie.\\n\\nAL missed his father. The news of how he died was too much. He thought of him when in ported into \\\"the Interface\\\". Suddenly he was in a room that like his bedroom as a child, back in the Cadmus family compound.\\n\\n\\\"Hello son. I left this \\\"expee\\\", this experience, for you, just in case. I wanted to go over the plan. It will be up to you now.”\\n\\nAN EXPEE FILE RENDERED itself around AL. He was bathed in light and data he never saw before. “Cadmus” spoke:\\n\\n“The \\\"Trinity\\\". The \\\"Fosters\\\", \\\"Intelligences\\\" near omnipotent runs it all. The Delegates, who run the physical world. The Lightmakers, who run the virtual world.\\n\\nAfter the peace treaties were signed, the Trinity latched onto my research of the \\\"manifold\\\" - the twisting of space-time. They were interested in only one use case - virtual reality.\\n\\nThe Trinity wanted to boot up virtual reality and upload minds into a new virtual reality. There was pressure to give a post-war society a fresh start. The Trinity held the \\\"Grand Vote\\\", persuaded enough people to approve it. The price was giving up the stars and new worlds.\\n\\nThe problem with this is that they would end up killing everyone. The upload will fail as configured. Worse, diversion of the Array to power it could destroy everything.\\n\\nI tried but failed to stop them. I had to come up with a plan.\\n\\nYou and your other brothers were going to help me. When it was just you and me, I made a new plan.\\n\\nYou are capable of doing a lot more than your brothers. You can create a lifeboat to save many lives. You will build a new kind of pocket reality. It won’t save everyone but I have a “plan B” for those who still dream about the stars.\\n\\nYou can do it. You were made for this. The long night will come to an end. We can make our own lives instead of being trapped in the nightmare of someone else’s dreams.”\\n\\nThere was more but AL exited. He needed a short rest first.\",\"timestamp\":1633972421,\"title\":\"2921: 3.27 Awake Before Dawn, 2902\"},\"digest\":\"moKActKuYCZJIOnn1XF8JKjfv2aX5ejFfH2gDJTvK_U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1eflGnKFM3SKOg7nrm2OnIIbFcEV2QO1-93PEWrICaB-kL7B2U2fNGyVII4oU9qvcAzbVeqjVRn7L4lSuJ9FUA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FGbLiNzt2YRGA6PckYLExTAlBOp_pLkMKjW-sHf4_Dw\"}"
