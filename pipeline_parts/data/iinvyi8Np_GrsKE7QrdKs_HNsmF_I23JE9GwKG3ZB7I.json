Psycho pass came with high recs on Reddit so I decided it would be a nice start. What I liked: The thought experiment in play of taking away decisions from humans on crimes and society navigation. Elon Musk said somewhere soon AI will treat humans like humans treat cats- as a pet to indulge. This may soon be a reality so it was interesting to see something so old have the same set up and indulge us. World Building: The entire cyberhuman thing, cute AIs, delving into how society was, the starting scenes that showed how the world was, were nice Makishima: I agreed with his free will premise, and had a lot of sympathy for him. He was open minded and his questions were very valid and deserved to make intelligent officers doubt themselves too. The cataclysm he set off in the masses, their questioning selves was so interesting!\\n\\nMaybe his belief in free will was the reason his hue remained unclouded.\\n\\nKogami's voice: The English dubbing artist whose voice was used, was chef's kiss. \\n\\nGinoza and Dad: Their dynamic was good, I felt sad when the dad stepped in for G, even though it wasn't a huge surprise. I liked G and how cornered he felt by the chief's demands and later tried to help Kogami behind her back. His struggle and background was interesting and realistic. \\n\\nWhat I did not like: \\n\\nAkane: How rigid she was from the start to the end, her development never came through. Life is about evolving, being a little open minded, a fresh morally grey character is always interesting and that never happened. Because being a rookie brought up in a society where crime wasn't rampant made her idealistic and too dumb. She felt like a high school principle whose morals never yawn. \\n\\nExcept for being told she topped exams, I never saw her do anything very intelligent. She showed backbone at the strangest places, she constantly hit Kogami (who just forgave her like a sweetheart) but never any other important criminal. There is a difference between theory and real life for sure. \\n\\nI liked it when M slit her friend's throat and she was shaken. She should have been more alert from there on, more doubtful and puzzled. I guess that's why her hue didn't get clouded but whatever. \\n\\nMakishima's constant explanations and philosophical rants: Blah blah. Woof woof. He's well read, but could he stop quoting others and present his own views please? I liked when he talked about Free Will and seeing people make choices- I wish that bit was explored more-the psyche of people who have forgotten to make decisions. \\n\\nBeing told the enforcers sucked: They were pretty humane through out. Except for their Sybil scores, I never saw any risk from them, why would Akane ever treat them anything less than friends? She should have questioned Sybil more. We are told several times they have damaged souls blah blah but actually, Tomomi, Kagari etc were decent fellows and very normal. If that was the point, I missed it, I would have liked them to be a little more angry and stage some rebellion too. \\n\\nKogami's POV: He moodily accepted Akane's lectures for half episodes before doing whatever he wanted. The way he resolved the suspense was too quick and didn't give watchers a chance to puzzle over it. He'd see some murder and immediately hit upon M's thinking, just like that! He went to an internet forum and read the whole food production thing and just zeroed in on that as M's next move? It would have been better at least if his theory went wayward at least once- him chasing a false trail and effing up. \\n\\nPlus, he never felt the Chief was weird and thought to question her? Maybe cause he had less interaction but from her weird orders all the time to G, could he have pieced something together? His entire think like a criminal/psycho antenna was reserved for M but not others around maybe.\\n\\nIn which case, it would have been better if he questioned himself on his free will given that he was a victim of Sybil too.\\n\\nWeak character development: Kogami was the only one who understood Makishima, so the other characters could not be developed. There was no team work. Where was Akane's strategic brain? Tomomi only seemed to be insightful when Kogami wasn't around, Kagari had no character except for calling Akane a cutie with steel balls- I wish he had actually feigned his death to give him some character! \\n\\nThe reveal about Sybil: I didn't care one bit about it. I wish the chief was a normal psychopath like Makishima. It would have been more interesting to create factions and for Kogami to unfurl the truth on her. It would have been so fun if he and M worked together or something like that. Maybe the masses should have been interviewed at the end and expressed serious doubts about Sybil after the riots and helmet stuff. Overall, I enjoyed the series, it was my first sci-fi, I haven't read in this genre so I liked the new world and questions it raised, but really, M deserved a better death. Thanks for reading!\\n\\nPS: Women wear non-matching underthings all the time but okay, I can suspend my disbelief on that one.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1642498104,\"title\":\"Psycho Pass Season 1 Review (Anime Spoilers)\\n\"},\"digest\":\"jm6NSpMC74rrAKJ4jE9oT34E9APkBj9zwF0N64Bblq0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x23860B3E7000fa31B3081592Bd54434e789E2365\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wqjRmf4wq4AHoyKBHMumkrTIHTi9dbC6XMSwnEl4BQg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yvs2QX2QJ4l8nURmbiK-59ydPIHYaAhxLR5HBP5Nvno\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SbzPBNpVlCabaQZNBeItx6mgbn_iWIQMftRwNR89lUvppD7jQuG1sfvq53rhELzTz20VHp_leY-hUNaoymt-bA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x32b2557184a4d32c18b9b17dd878c6165dddc2ff635cdf97b9ac56b87b021db768a14c865555bbca4451140e99856e935679ef1fb3c279bfada35ebb1c5da5eb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wqjRmf4wq4AHoyKBHMumkrTIHTi9dbC6XMSwnEl4BQg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yvs2QX2QJ4l8nURmbiK-59ydPIHYaAhxLR5HBP5Nvno\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jm6NSpMC74rrAKJ4jE9oT34E9APkBj9zwF0N64Bblq0\"}"
