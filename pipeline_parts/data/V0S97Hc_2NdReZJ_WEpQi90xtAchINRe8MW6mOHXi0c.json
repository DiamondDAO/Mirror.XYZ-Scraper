"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Proof of Stake is a peer-to-peer based consensus mechanism that serves to maintain the integrity of a blockchain with a process that requires less energy consumption and arguably offers more decentralization than its counterpart, Proof of Work. It is used in many cryptocurrencies including Solana, Cardano, and Algorand. Unlike POW, POS does not have miners. Instead, owners of a cryptocurrency must *stake* tokens in order to create validator nodes that will earn rewards for validating transactions.**\\n\\n**Staking**\\n\\n* Staking is when one pledges their tokens to be used for verifying transactions\\n* Tokens are locked up when they are staked, they must be unstaked if one wishes to trade them\\n\\n**PoW Inefficiencies**\\n\\no   Uses massive amounts of energy to secure the network\\n\\no   Better/more equipment > higher hashrate > higher chance of creating next block and receiving reward. This takes away from decentralization\\n\\no   Miners can come together to form mining pools by combining hashing power and distributing awards amongst themselves. Also takes away from decentralization.\\n\\n**PoS Advantages**\\n\\no   More environmentally sustainable\\n\\no   More people can participate because there is no need for expensive equipment, this makes the network more decentralized and easier to scale\\n\\no   Fairer than POW because the rich cannot take advantage of economies of scale\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n<https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/cryptocurrency-stocks/proof-of-stake/#:\\\\~:text=Proof%20of%20stake%20is%20a,add%20them%20to%20the%20blockchain>.\\n\\n<https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-stake-pos.asp>\\n\\nSources from YouTube video\\n\\nBack, A., & others.
