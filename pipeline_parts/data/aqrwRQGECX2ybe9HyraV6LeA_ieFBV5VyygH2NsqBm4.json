"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[EMBEDDED CROWDFUND]\\n\\nOver the past few weeks, a group of independent online creators have been living at a cabin retreat outside of Austin, TX and asking ourselves:\\n\\n> ## What could our community do with a year of time and space to create?\\n\\nWe want to bring more people out to the cabins to help answer the question.\\n\\n[PICTURE OF GROUP]\\n\\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at Creator Cabins in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. It's the first node in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\\n\\n[PICTURE OF CABIN]\\n\\nWe're setting up a DAO to manage the crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\\n\\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months worth of time staying at the cabins. This would allow us to fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. We have four bedrooms available, so we could run three cohorts of four creators each. \\n\\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and back to the DAO.\\n\\n\\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins. We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of interesting conversations and collaboration at the cabins. In particular, we'd like to thank <<<<<<<<>>>>>>>>. We hope this residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one. \\n\\n[PICTURE?]\\n\\nFAQs\\n\\n**Who is eligible for a residency?**\\n\\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of creators: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders, YOU. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide. \\n\\n**How will the money be spent?**\\n\\nWe are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week for room and board, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins). \\n\\n**What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?**\\n\\nThe DAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else the DAO decides to grant them to.\\n\\n**\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621866816,\"title\":\"$CABIN: creator residency crowdfund\",\"publication\":\"creators\"},\"digest\":\"qmGMI4UTfj4O47bdGjNTW3cG7QqLt9wuHQXvfcpG3ss\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZDlhJZQ0hfXSwgFy_dldmR9lmjEnSewfmEsE1XIpgoo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fo5VrP3ivmMtUHGkrqg5ImpKZqPoeeetwH99a8BNKgY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LGLiB-d9hbJnFXBGXo_vUIrjR66xuO_LyxvoJzOviKyd7kffPAv2W8Gyi2prJ6NYivGU8_UDUw8A2D3EaYRYmQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcbd55f06c62b374c175099440348482da59dd6a25a3982c3eb9f8a4b42d8561f168efdfb659c4a68a548db9035d89eea96fc23d65a053ee4e8e8fbdf31c5361c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on creators.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZDlhJZQ0hfXSwgFy_dldmR9lmjEnSewfmEsE1XIpgoo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fo5VrP3ivmMtUHGkrqg5ImpKZqPoeeetwH99a8BNKgY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bq669jDh2Rra9sE0qhYv0zYrn-rZRvtGJM1mspQ3Ok8\"}"
