"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Stepping into the small council hall, he saw grand Duke Russell, the prime minister, Marshal Rochelio, and Count Chandler, the vice-minister of military affairs, all waiting in dishevelled clothes. Louis IX couldn't help cheering up.The old king sat on his throne and ordered his council to sit down. \\\"What do you think of this miracle at Lille?\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe deep voice of the great warlock in Lhasa sounded first: \\\"According to historical records, there were three miraculous signs to the royal family in The Continent of Gloria. Each time, the families who were given the miraculous signs raised soldiers to rebel successively, the war spread to several countries, and killed all the blood descendants of the royal family in the previous dynasty, and finally formed the three great powers in the continent today.This time, fortunately, the Archduke of Bavaria, despite his prowess, has only one son, Ophelock, to spare us a lot of trouble.This time let the old husband meet the father and son two people, must get the head of two people just back to Beijing!Though it is hard to disobey god's orders, this time I will disobey my old husband, even if he is condemned by thousands of others to die in hell!\\\"\\n\\nRussell: \\\"This miracle happened suddenly, without any prior information from the Church of Light.As far as I know, there may be reincarnated angels in the church of Light.After the miracle, the power of the church will grow rapidly, and the attitude of this matter will be crucial.According to my Lord, your Majesty may take this sign for transshipment to the church.If anything happens in the future, it's best to keep the church out of it.Second, the Grand Duke of Bavaria has done great service to his state for many years, and has just been blessed by angels. If he does anything wrong at this moment, he will be angry with others and shake the foundation of his state.The third was that the archduchess was the sister of the Austro-Hungarian emperor, a belligerent and successful man who would have given the Archduke of Bavaria a pretext for intervention.Therefore, I think that it is necessary to take all measures to preserve the bourbon empire. It is not appropriate to do so at this time.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1635751822,\"title\":\"Lhasa grand sorcerer\"},\"digest\":\"Z6W_75_Fy9thdXXhPbAepDvnQof3VTziDysRB_fsLIE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x48a9D0791753D3d02F8c85D79f19203FaFB57d97\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lmpQey7B-kHT7Umtt9r1Z59b_dl5fyi4VpJv4zlyVTE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sFLrWLNzQwyYycM764Uh_RqzdAIoblQKt4m_oFXgNkg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7n8lScnaS1-eepsUnXdHiNXyARCapoG6uvygvge5OfAXLVZsSjW54yT5I3-CHCnF2ayUoTwNZV6E8ekiUxx5gA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc0ab37728fbe25a43b0f80a9433cf31372e4b3b216eeefcd719eb58e4f6dd3343f6f70d07050f5955926fad342260782c52a830f78b5cf34839e20b6377f67cf1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lmpQey7B-kHT7Umtt9r1Z59b_dl5fyi4VpJv4zlyVTE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"sFLrWLNzQwyYycM764Uh_RqzdAIoblQKt4m_oFXgNkg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Z6W_75_Fy9thdXXhPbAepDvnQof3VTziDysRB_fsLIE\"}"
