"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello all!\\n\\nMy name is Michael and I’m a music producer and artist hailing from New York City!  \\n\\nI’m finally starting to dip my toes into Web3 after being hesitant for a while but I really believe in Web3 and crypto as a whole. \\n\\nOn top of being a musician and producer, I am also a programmer and went to school for Computer Science so software has always been my forté and I believe Web3 is perfect for combining my skills in Software Engineering and Music.\\n\\nI'm a music nerd and always have been. I went to high school at Frank Sinatra School of the Arts in Astoria, NYC where my love (and hate) of music grew. I learned so much about music and the various movements of music over the past millennium. \\n\\nMy love for jazz especially grew in high school. I sat in as a freshman in the jazz band on trombone which was my instrument for many years. While my first instrument was guitar, I decided to audition with the trombone and got into the school through that so I had to play trombone. Eventually, I ended up playing guitar in the jazz band after much proving my skills to the jazz band teacher. \\n\\nHere are some of my favorite jazz records!\\n\\n![the sheets of sound on this album blew my mind as a young teenager. truly revolutionary music in every way.](https://imagine-club.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_zoom/public/photos/giant_steps_coltrane_john_2_lp_atlantic_eu.jpg?itok=-zbeuhlu)\\n\\n![another revolutionary record that greatly influenced me. it showed me that any music has the potential to be psychedelic and can transcend all labels and genres. miles davis was a true genius and this is one of his best in my opinion](https://www.andantarctica.co.uk/media/2015/10/miles-davis-bitches-brew.jpg)\\n\\n![here's a more modern record that I think is pushing the jazz genre into the future. in a world where all the non-musicians try and put you in a box with genres and labels, it's very inspiring to see artists break all that down and transcend labels once again. gives me much hope for the future of music. ](https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a2935089641_10.jpg)\\n\\nAfter leaving high school a bit burnt out from music, I decided to study Computer Science at Queens College and began attending in 2017. Computer Science really appealed to me because of the nature of our modern world. I subconciously knew that the world is pivoting to the software model everywhere and I placed my bets on programming. \\n\\nIf I can program a computer and learn how to use data to spot trends, that’s a very very valuable skill. I can work in any field I choose. While the coursework was extremely hard at times and gave me much depression and anxiety for so long, only now am I starting to realize how powerful those skills are. They have set me up for a lifetime of wealth. I can now program my own reality.\\n\\nI am 22 years young and ready to give my all to the world. I want to make great music and support others in making great music and share this culture of music around the world.\\n\\nI started The Cosmic Sunshine in 2017 in the summer before my first semester in college. \\n\\n![the logo I commissioned for my project. I pretty much told the guy to make it look like the cover of Rubber Soul lol ](https://thecosmicsunshine.com/static/media/logo1.9fc84211.svg)\\n\\nI was super into the 60’s psychedelic rock scene back then. Bands like the Beatles, Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix. I was loving this kind of music and decided to name my project The Cosmic Sunshine because of the whole scene. While I originally planned it to be a more psych rock project, my taste began to develop more and I began to listen to many new artists and projects once I got older and met more people. \\n\\nI remember around 2018, I was at my GF’s house and I was going through her record collection and I saw this record. \\n\\n![looked kinda dumb but i gave it a listen anyway...](http://images6.fanpop.com/image/polls/1627000/1627884_1494251781769_full.jpg)\\n\\nI remember then telling her\\n\\n> I don’t really get Radiohead… What’s their deal?\\n\\nlittle did I know….\\n\\nAs soon as I heard Planet Telex and that tremolo-d intro guitar, I was hooked. \\n\\nI have her to thank for opening up my mind to so many new ideas and new music that I otherwise would have passed over. Our perceptions of the world cloud our mind sometimes so I’m grateful to have had people introduce to me to music and art that I would have never listened to on my own. \\n\\nMy vision for the Cosmic Sunshine has always been to digest various music cultures and scenes and make it into my own. I want to make a shoegaze album. A IDM album. A indie pop record. A house record. A hard rock/punk record. \\n\\nSo many ideas in my head and so little time….\\n\\nhere are some of the records I’ve been listening to recently and have been influencing my next project…\\n\\n![one of my favorite records of the 2010's. The production on this record is unbelievable... the synths, drum machines and vocal melodies. It's a masterpiece and I'm sad that they broke up so it's unlikely we'll see another Paradis record. A man can only dream. Pierre Rousseau also makes great music in his own right and makes incredible synth music. Highly recommend this record to anyone looking for great electro-pop. Don't let the language barrier keep you from enjoying wonderful music ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/muLs-iHW6X5ySUzaSg4WD.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\\n\\n![there's so much I can say about this record... probably my favorite record of all time to be honest. Kevin Parker is the voice of a generation I would argue. The production on this record is ground breaking and I have spent years dissecting this album and finding out what makes it so special to me and to so many others. Like the cover, it's a window into Kevin's mind and the songs really reflect that. I've always been an introvert so Kevin's music always appealed to me and I think his music is just so magical. Kevin's music brought me out of some of the darkest places in my life and Tame Impala is one of my greatest influences. Can't wait to be older and telling my kids about the how sICk the Mind Mischief bridge is and to listen to the flanger on the whole mix. I really owe it all to Tame Impala and Kevin. Geniuses like him only come around so often so it is amazing to be able to live in a time where I can see a band like Tame Impala live. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Lm6LOyZehl_YJk7DIO5qS.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\\n\\n![I discovered Papooz during the pandemic in April of 2020. I immediately was enamored by their music and artistic tastes. This record is great because it has so many little moments through and while the songs change up from disco to more soft pop, the vibe never leaves your ears. It's a nice sounding record with great vocal production and with great lyrics as well. Really looking forward to the next Papooz record.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MlnN1gxwOGyr5UYJBCmcJ.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\\n\\n![i know this record is memed so hard at this point but it really is revolutionary. like everyone else, I thought to myself \\\"what tf is this bs, sounds like a vacuum cleaner to me...\\\" but this record really is so special due to the songwriting and sonic production. Just like Coltrane was painting sheets of sound with his saxophone, Kevin Shields was doing the same with a Jazzmaster and a fuzz pedal. My favorite song off this record is Soon. it's such a bop. Really want to bring the sheets of sound found in this record to my projects. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4q6ZwNyTqbwkC5ep-CfCV.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\\n\\n![love this record. I first found out about Clubz through Youtube and their music videos and I really enjoyed their music. They have such a fresh sound and on top of their production, the songs are super catchy and very pop. Super danceable record. Some of my favorites off this one are Réplica and Popscuro. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mqRWnn-J3Omyf4MXOgkyy.jpg?height=1280&width=1280)\\n\\nI have so many records I would love to talk about more in depth but I think i’ll save those for future posts. \\n\\nI wanted to just introduce myself and talk a bit about my background as well as my own musical project, the Cosmic Sunshine. \\n\\nIf you are interested in checking out my music, you can find me as The Cosmic Sunshine on all platforms. \\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\n\\\\-Michael \",\"timestamp\":1639473938,\"title\":\"a Hello from the Cosmic Sunshine!\"},\"digest\":\"A6RanxCYKw_E_1MdISCme54IYn0hZ1f6GuAva5ukq50\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcF0d89AcC115f3e1537930fe9E883cb0F5C4cBa7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KlOtnr6rR1hNPF1vLxs9GdowOX7yfuXrUHYavGGYYpU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g3nLTlhbLyx7Brt7rYsOHbh02508dmZYSmU_FPKqUEA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NBEwW6TI6xh21u2FVpoaKj8syVnJV0DhslP7ggesFqr2lRrFniOj_NW6Nv84uQ8zvEHS_pugNZdKhIJndygGGw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x44e50df57fc8f6273493f50ae90ab9f1768e6c9e9cea414f56279462ab88a41037f06f448d63cdb3db901279420d3e0e072c08a36e91cf73e072191e19d375f31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KlOtnr6rR1hNPF1vLxs9GdowOX7yfuXrUHYavGGYYpU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g3nLTlhbLyx7Brt7rYsOHbh02508dmZYSmU_FPKqUEA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"A6RanxCYKw_E_1MdISCme54IYn0hZ1f6GuAva5ukq50\"}"
