"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello friends, and welcome back to **Week in Review**!\\n\\nLast week, we talked about Apple’s subscription addiction. This week, I’m diving deep into whether there’s actually any meaning to pull out of the NFT mania of 2021.\\n\\nIf you’re reading this on the TechCrunch site, you can get this in your inbox from the newsletter page, and follow my tweets @lucasmtny\\n\\n## the big thing\\n\\nThe NFT market is still defying reason, but then again that’s kind of its thing. But one thing I’m especially unsure about lately as I see JPGs continue to sell for millions of dollars is… does any of this actually matter?\\n\\nI’ve spent a lot of time over the last year grappling with the NFT market, at times I’ve lost sleep over it. As a reporter frequently covering this market, I don’t own or trade the little images myself, but that hasn’t stopped me from obsessing over the fluctuations in their prices and scouring Discords trying to follow the trends. I’ve tuned into countless Twitter Spaces and lurked subreddits trying to understand it all. I’ve also done my best to keep most of that out of this newsletter — it’s a weird niche interest that’s especially niche at the moment — but as Bitcoin flirts with a new all-time-high and the NFT mania persists, just consider this a timely update.\\n\\nSo, in the past month, investors have continued dropping billions upon billions of dollars on NFTs. OpenSea has seen more than $3 billion in transaction volume in the past 30 days, and that number is actually way down quite a bit from August, showcasing just how much off-peak money continues to flow into NFTs.\\n\\nAll of that money has gone to some colorful places. One of the bigger success stories of the past month has been the platform CrypToadz which investors dumped $100 million into. They look like this. In the past couple weeks, a brand new project called MekaVerse saw $130 million in transaction volume. They’re a bit prettier, but would you spend more than $8,000 on one? The platform Cryptoslam (where I pulled most of the data I reference here) is tracking 163 platforms which did more than $1 million in volume in the past 30 days, a number which doesn’t even account for individual artists selling their work on platforms like OpenSea.\",\"timestamp\":1634579429,\"title\":\"Does the NFT craze actually matter?\"},\"digest\":\"jSEnp-zld4E1coK8y5GxOXYahrseza8NV1b0ji3FZYI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2Df1f8a66d2a8f32293E10321aCb25365F0c549a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cUrCj-f4HUQsX7bZqo1J7I30lhelYlj9aq-firjKOEE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BtOcvctC5VTDwLLOjVIg6mHEwocP5ECtQaa_t_k8Pq4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jhcQ78SVcixtdIuirAoEcNhM7c7VCJPEqWTWZF-6XNgn0PKJ0kb6hqXObQ5KE3N89g4HzMRF2NnpSIbOH43Rsg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc964fd97bcfe44db6ffda7f20909b1359485dfc4104fb977283983fe426716766930460b82d0e64b8dec905c8a3f8c946eebfc6a2373737beb82a0defa546bac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cUrCj-f4HUQsX7bZqo1J7I30lhelYlj9aq-firjKOEE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BtOcvctC5VTDwLLOjVIg6mHEwocP5ECtQaa_t_k8Pq4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jSEnp-zld4E1coK8y5GxOXYahrseza8NV1b0ji3FZYI\"}"
