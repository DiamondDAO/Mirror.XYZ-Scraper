"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Let us start simple, what are social connections? **Social connections refer to the interactions, relationships, and affiliations we have with other humans or collectives in our lives**. Social connections are a core psychological need for every human being. Humans are, by nature, social creatures. We actively seek social connections and rewards in the majority of our daily actions. Scientists believe we are essentially wired to connect with other people because natural selection favored humans with a stronger propensity to care for their offspring and organize into groups.\\n\\nWith the technological evolution that took place over the millennia, the way we make social connections has evolved as well. In a hunter-gatherer society, the distance and quantity of social connections were limited to your tribe and your immediate environment. Through inventions like written text, books, and modern forms of transportation, new forms of social connections emerged. This transformation was rapidly accelerated in the 20th Century through new mediums of communication like the telegraph, telephone, and eventually the computer. Since then the rate of transformation has exponentially increased with the dawn of the internet, and new forms of mass communication like email, direct messengers, and social media.\\n\\nNowadays, our social connections reach far and wide across the globe, creating millions of interconnected networks along the way. It is easier than ever to communicate both with your immediate social circles, as well as distant ties around the world. Since the emergence of online social media, we have also observed the phenomenon of online social connections that may never lead to in-person connections and that have a very different nature than the types of social connections humans had throughout history.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FtvNjEiKMRjB0coeTQvJW.png?height=1050&width=1400)\\n\\n**On a psychological level, all of these connections can be broken down to three kinds of social rewards that result in the release of neurotransmitters like dopamine or oxytocin**. The three rewards are: Rewards of the Tribe, Rewards of the Hunt, and Rewards of the Self.\\n\\n**Rewards of the Tribe** are most prominently found in social media nowadays. They include empathic joy from others for achievements and looks or general content you post (think: likes and comments). We are meant to be part of a tribe so our brains seek out rewards that make us feel accepted, important, attractive, and included. Social networks have found clever ways to stimulate these quests for rewards through likes and comments.\\n\\n**Rewards of the Hunt** refer to our desire to acquire things. The need to acquire physical things, such as food and supplies, is part of the brain’s operating system and we would not have survived the millennia without this impulse. But where we once hunted for food, today we hunt for deals and information. Or in the case of crypto, for the next rare NFT or the next high potential altcoin. In social media, this mechanism is used in combination with the powerful effect of variable rewards. When you find yourself scrolling through the Twitter feed, your brain is hoping to find the next piece of engaging content which will trigger a reward of the hunt. That is why social networks like TikTok and Instagram are often quite addictive. They engineer their products to trigger these rewards as often as possible until your brain builds a habit around rewards of the hunt.\\n\\nFinally, there are the **Rewards of the Self** which we seek for personal gratification. For example, from birth, things that stimulate our senses mesmerize us. Babies put everything in their mouths for the same reason there are flashing neon lights in Las Vegas. We love novel sensory stimulation. This includes game mechanics in video games, being productive by going through all your emails or replying to messages we get from family and friends. We have a natural drive for both sensory stimulations as well as the feeling of being productive or doing something meaningful.\\n\\nAsk yourself, why are you doing what you are doing every day? Almost every action you take falls under one of the three categories. Why are you reading this article right now?\\n\\n**It is important to understand the core motivation behind social connections to build and optimize for them**. What we are seeing with a lot of Web3 social companies right now is that they very much optimize for the tokenization aspect of Web3. They integrate NFTs and token rewards for interaction or engagement as well as tools for monetization of content for creators. While all of these approaches are interesting in a Web3 setting, they often undermine the social connections and the natural rewards that come from human interaction.\\n\\n**At Solomon, we want to integrate social connections into Web3 without changing the fundamental nature of how we interact.** We want to use NFTs as a further extension of **Rewards of the Hunt**. We want to enable you to proudly show off your newest NFT instead of building a marketplace to sell them. It is also about optimizing for **Rewards of the Tribe**. How can you interact with the communities and individuals that you care about? How can you share your thoughts, your NFTs, and your personal life in a way that feels rewarding and fun? Not how you can find yet another way to make a quick flip. The difference is our emphasis on the social aspect, otherwise, we would just be another bad copy of Opensea.\\n\\nThe next important question is how can we build a network that delivers value to all of its members? Some value will come through variable **rewards of the hunt** in the form of engaging content and NFTs. Some through **rewards of the self** in the form of colorful visual art and discussions that broaden your horizon. As well as **rewards of the tribe**, by connecting you with the communities and topics that matter to you. Every individual is different and Web3 lives off the communities as well as the crypto-related and real-life experiences and opinions of its members.\\n\\nUnlike other industries, many segments in Web3 — like Gaming, Defi or NFTs — are closely connected. Both technologically and through the communities that build this space. **It is our mission to create even more meaningful connections between communities and individuals to maximize the impact that we can have together.**\\n\\nBut without the right tools to find the communities that resonate with you, it is going to be hard to build meaningful connections. Connecting means sharing what matters to you, viewing what matters to others, and having the tools that enable direct communication to discuss these topics, events, and differences.\\n\\nWeb2 has been pretty successful in optimizing for social connections. But due to their centralized nature, they, unfortunately, have some major flaws within their networks. The first one is the control they impose as the intermediary/platform that facilitates the transaction. If you do not agree with their values, or if you simply want to switch platforms, you stand in front of a big barrier. They do not allow you to take your network with you. There is no button to take your network and leave their platform.\\n\\nThe second problem lies within the algorithmic nature of their newsfeeds. The main business model for social networks in Web2 is an advertisement, which results in two major problems: first, they need to collect tons of personal data about you to feed their recommendation engines for both content and advertisements. This is necessary to optimize for higher engagement which will result in their customers (the advertiser) spending more money. The second problem is that while you might use their network to grow organically for a while, they will slow down your exposure at some point in order to get you to spend on ads.\\n\\n**This violates the very nature of social connections by preventing the natural flow of information.** It is the big weak spot in their otherwise perfected machinery of connecting people. Their dependence on ads limits their possibilities and limits us in our expressions and ability to connect with like-minded individuals.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IXkhUk8-xOryfOv9u-Gq1.png?height=933&width=1400)\\n\\nAt **Solomon** we want to take the opposite approach. **Instead of relying on Advertisements, we will explore the possibilities of micro-transactions and transaction fees.** While micro-transactions are hardly profitable in a small network, they will be superior in profitability in economies of scale. And these profits can then be redistributed in parts to the community itself. By making our platform open for other developers to build on top of our network and build their own communities, we allow for more decentralized control. Our network will neither be closed off nor very hard to leave. In fact, you will never need to leave our network because it will never be our network. The communities that form will be in full control of their network and its members, and they can take them wherever they want, whenever they want.\\n\\n**We are only the platform to provide the visual structure and tools needed for communities to connect. We are not in control of the network itself.** Nor will we control the flow of information. Over time we will provide communities with tools like recommendation engines, monetization, ephemerality and more. But it will always be the choice of the individual and the community on whether to adopt these tools or not. You will finally be in control of your social connections, your social networks, and your content and data.\",\"timestamp\":1642640213,\"title\":\"Social Connections and their underlying mechanics\"},\"digest\":\"bhMasLOW8CcvXcKVGT5aD16fRom73matwtUA1WaD-a8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA0125FDcb3e65A2cEaDF459B8d4454167eC51D7E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-nOFWbkoK9PSLA3JDGRX-wnsCUbJymikqvelk-BkrdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_r3lsgwQAf_faUv6tkrWGThd1jGAREcBaAehkGlbg2Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Jtv-aP4BnTF8x2gvr7pqyu80nvMrJx6r9RFnBeF-irpFlrUc2ekl_uzRVhNLegSp16vdOgmIAX0GHx3nvIFIyw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9e868e13b03919aa7bb14a324934ade02f141ff34c3832628a7251b1f53959e439822cbf823013c789f1a73c0946eae86ae0434369d0307ee7b367ed7fa426b11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-nOFWbkoK9PSLA3JDGRX-wnsCUbJymikqvelk-BkrdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_r3lsgwQAf_faUv6tkrWGThd1jGAREcBaAehkGlbg2Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bhMasLOW8CcvXcKVGT5aD16fRom73matwtUA1WaD-a8\"}"
