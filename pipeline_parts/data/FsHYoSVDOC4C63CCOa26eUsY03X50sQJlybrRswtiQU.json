"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Maybe I should start with a disclaimer. I am not a writer. I actually got a C+ on my first paper in WRIT150 my freshman year at USC. So, if you have high expectations for whatever it is you are about to read … don’t.\\n\\nI am writing this because I think I have had one of the weirdest, luckiest onboarding experiences into crypto. In a little less than six days, I have actively joined 3 DAO’s, gone from 0-4.6k followers on my newly created Twitter account (@regannotraygan) and I am fielding offers to head up some incredible projects. So, how did this all happen to me when, just a few hours ago, I legitimately searched up “what really is Bitcoin?”\\n\\nSo okay, you’re confused. Me too. But let’s talk about it. For some reason, the Twitter algorithm took a liking to me. So much so, I have lots of no profile-photo accounts accusing me of being a bot or a fed. Is this what being famous feels like?\\n\\nAll jokes aside, I am incredibly lucky. And I wanna use this opportunity. I want to create content that is easy to follow, funny, and dedicated to on-boarding people from all backgrounds into the Web3 space.\\n\\nFor today’s piece, though, instead of telling you about all the crypto-jargon I learned (which I WILL tell you all about … in another write-up) I want to give some unsolicited advice.\\n\\n## My Advice\\n\\nIntroduce yourself.\\n\\nThis is arguably the most important lesson. Whether its in a DAO discord server in the #introductions channel or its in someone’s Twitter DM’s, say hello. For me, it started with hello:\\n\\nHi! I am Regan! I am a student at USC and a total newbie but I am so excited to learn from you all.\\n\\nSaying hello in the @IndexCoop channel allowed me to meet @kindeagle, my first Twitter follower and still one of my biggest supporters. Saying hello allowed me to meet @theyoungcrews who may actually be my number one fan, alongside @charmgci. Saying hello is what allowed me to chat with some of the most impactful women in this space.\\n\\nSo, if you’re reading this and are interested in this space but you haven’t “made the leap” let me help. Message me. Seriously. Message me on Twitter. I will respond. I respond to everyone. Even if it’s just hello. Even if its a list of 10+ questions. If you are unsure of where to begin, begin here. Because guess what? We are beginning together.  And I have way, way too much time on my hands, so I want to get to know you. While I may not have all the answers, if you need a crypto-partner-in-crime, send me a Twitter DM.\\n\\n## Closing Notes\\n\\nI went into this piece thinking I was going to explain NFT’s and DAO’s. I can still write about all that stuff. I want to. But for today, for tonight, this felt like enough. If you read this far -- thank you. This community has shown me so much love. My life has changed in this past week and I am at a loss for words. I guess, for now, this article will have to suffice.\\n\\nUntil next time, Cryptoverse.
