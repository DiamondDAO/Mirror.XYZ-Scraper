"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Per a new [report released by digital-asset intelligence firm CipherTrace](https://cointelegraph.com/news/14b-in-crypto-stolen-in-first-five-months-of-2020-says-ciphertrace) on June 2, the value of ill-gotten funds siphoned through [cryptocurrency](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/cryptocurrencies) crimes over the first five months of the year stands at a whopping $1.4 billion, thus making 2020 a potentially active year in regard to cryptocurrency-related thefts, hacks and fraud.\\n\\nThe report goes on to state that if things continue at the same rate, the total volume of stolen crypto for 2020 has the potential to get close to reaching the $4.5-billion mark set in 2019. Criminals appear to be capitalizing on the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic to target unsuspecting individuals by luring them in via a variety of crypto-related [phishing](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/phishing) campaigns, [ransomware](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/ransomware) and [darknet](https://cointelegraph.com/tags/darknet) marketplace fraud. \\n\\nAdditionally, out of the multiple scams that have been accounted for this year, many of them have reportedly made use of email campaigns impersonating various coronavirus-related official groups — such as the World Health Organization, the Red Cross and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — to solicit payments and donations in the form of cryptocurrency.\\n\\n***Related: [Public Service Announcement: Beware of Imposters Posing as Cointelegraph Journalists](https://cointelegraph.com/news/public-service-announcement-beware-of-imposters-posing-as-cointelegraph-journalists)***\\n\\nLastly, CipherTrace officials claim that of the $1.36 billion in crypto stolen so far this year, 98% of the total value — nearly $1.3 billion — can be attributed to fraud and misappropriation rather than to hacks and direct thefts.\\n\\n## Scammers have continued to evolve their methodologies\\n\\nTo gain a better understanding of where the market seems to be heading in the coming months and years, particularly when it comes to crypto crime, Cointelegraph spoke to John Jefferies, the chief marketing officer and chief financial analyst at CipherTrace. In his view, while it is nearly impossible to predict with any certainty how trends related to cryptocurrency theft and fraud will evolve this year, it is possible that by the time the year comes to a close, the amount of funds netted by criminals may exceed the expectations of the report, betting 2019’s $4.5 billion figure.\\n\\nFurther elaborating on the subject, Jefferies stated that the largest contributor to this year’s crypto crime total has been [Wotoken’s alleged billion-dollar Ponzi scheme](https://cointelegraph.com/news/plustoken-scammer-implicated-in-chinas-second-ten-figure-crypto-ponzi) that emerged from China. Furthermore, he is concerned in the coming months about exit scams by smaller virtual asset service providers, or VASPs, that that are struggling financially, adding:\",\"timestamp\":1639122022,\"title\":\"Crypto Crime on the Rise — Good Odds of 2020 Becoming a Record-Breaker\"},\"digest\":\"m75uBbHkCurcBpOXMp7VESE2mjeHIvwN95roObW_MjI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x96A7136A24B3132c359ED5C28e1507D5AE738d33\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QCK9r5mcvo4tqtnKe17X5LH0WIcN0LTRyt1Mf9A1kRc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X--0EXkE-Vm6Kt0JeBoiALekH4-a9IOQf-Q8jWzm4W4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1j7rOo1oQyRTS2ZcSzB7syS80u_fmugB4GnMD4ssTLn6i0qLeyuLntPBxUaDjsbZxSl8DpwFDoQD6vEfhmSQPA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc8ad8ece14190e800f39a7095e37fb6197e16e270b6c30ebec27ed1efc05e657fec3114da7181b4afad31a98a3178970d77e6d7b9a1122da377b4ad88891bad1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QCK9r5mcvo4tqtnKe17X5LH0WIcN0LTRyt1Mf9A1kRc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X--0EXkE-Vm6Kt0JeBoiALekH4-a9IOQf-Q8jWzm4W4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m75uBbHkCurcBpOXMp7VESE2mjeHIvwN95roObW_MjI\"}"
