"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hey guys. The auction portion of my NFT ended on my birthday (happy birthday to me) this past Sunday and it managed to sell and I’m just thankful I got that far. I think this token is the precursor to a lot of tokens like it in the future. I think when people are offering their service at a slight premium for the current time, but a discount in the possible future, it acts as an interesting financial support mechanism with a return for you on the back end, whether through the service itself or the trading of the token representing that service. I feel like there will come a time where people are tokenizing services for all sorts of things, and it floats around until it’s claimed or sold to someone else & eventually claimed. All that takes really is a platform.\\n\\nAnyway, enough about dreams of the future, I wanted to have a quick word vomit about what went down and what I learned from it. First, let’s start with this image, which essentially represents my stats for the drop so far:\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2388ad9b-0f01-4cdc-9fe9-af65b938c8f4\\\\_1440x920.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2388ad9b-0f01-4cdc-9fe9-af65b938c8f4\\\\_1440x920.jpeg)\\n\\nHaving one person, let alone 36 (one of those owners is me) and over 1 ETH in volume through the release of my music is absolutely insane to me, but I’m blessed to have this amount of support. I’m far from sold out but I’m very happy with the results. I have been actively thinking about what sustainability can look like as someone who makes music and I think I’m getting closer to that.\\n\\nSome of the highlights for me are:\\n\\n1.  Airdropping the special edition of the songs to my previous supporters (meaning I have 17 new collectors)\\n2.  Doing a series of drop rooms with [Aaron](http://twitter.com/aaronhaber) at the [NFT Innovation Society](https://www.clubhouse.com/club/nft-innovation-society) and [Clare](http://twitter.com/claremaguire) with [Showtime](http://tryshowtime.com/).\\n3.  Getting written about [on NFTs.WTF](https://nfts.wtf/in-conversation-with-black-dave/) by my dawg [Jessica Yatrofsky](http://twitter.com/jyatrofsky).\\n4.  Being able to engage in super interesting and engaging conversations with people about the potential future of music in NFTs.\\n\\nSome opportunities with this drop:\\n\\n1.  Auction had very low visibility. The [token itself](https://bit.ly/2VUOoWd) had only 43 views, which is far lower than I would have preferred, but we (yes, we) did manage to get it collected which is great, and for .33 ETH! Any sale was considered a win to me, so I’m glad it was above the floor…but disappointed that it didn’t get it’s full opportunity to win.\\n2.  Rap music in NFT still being underrepresented is very frustrating! I’m frustrated! A lot of innovation is gonna come from this side and being overlooked frustrates me!\\n3.  I haven’t sold out but it’s just another opportunity to go harder. Gotta go harder.\\n\\nNow that I’m wrapping this piece up, I feel like I haven’t said much…but I still believe that I’m on the right path by using NFT to find, or add to, sustainability as a rapper. Would love to hear what you guys think. See you on the other side.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633565567,\"title\":\"NFT Drop Reflections\"},\"digest\":\"_2BfVjFmMlSZJyOGRSwaLpiBSVlN1-FP9Ss_I1JlSks\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeD22Bb0106c24C7f6b4d8AAe33639e1467061F64\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-EwyH0X1WC6a_9lebdxcA6_in8sztD92b45VyjwsL1E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QdIDB4o5J3Xg5cTELV9PjZWrcCcmKONQjwMzkr9HxI0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FIeYs-pwDIafj9-7AAOgW1cUKdUaEJFPFxp0KTg643cliEVtz8WCQBFI-ACqH_bvmMg9h3Hgcal15d0p3GT5Rw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe445cbeeb1e2a2fc8e28cb7ac9029583b1354ddb03bcb7882004fc66e887fccd5cdf42a31c62d6000a030549b36d8be5d2203aef0b4017184750ca43a219eea31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-EwyH0X1WC6a_9lebdxcA6_in8sztD92b45VyjwsL1E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QdIDB4o5J3Xg5cTELV9PjZWrcCcmKONQjwMzkr9HxI0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_2BfVjFmMlSZJyOGRSwaLpiBSVlN1-FP9Ss_I1JlSks\"}"
