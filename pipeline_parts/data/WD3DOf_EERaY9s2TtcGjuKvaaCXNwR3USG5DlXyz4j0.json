At the moment no limitations apply to holding these tokens in the same wallet - but there might be in the future. Once minted the token structure is final and cannot be undone but they will remain transferable (unlike core, elder tokens, and the flex badges).\\n\\n*See you at Dawn.*\\n\\n## DAWN Glossary\\n\\n**Org. Wallet** - facing wallet of the organization where your Flex Badge will be sent.\\n\\n**Delegate’s Wallet** - a wallet controlled by the delegate - that will be used for voting and will receive a Delegate token.\\n\\n**Flex Badge** - a non-transferable token -  goes to the organization wallet and indicates that you are a part of Dawn DAO.
