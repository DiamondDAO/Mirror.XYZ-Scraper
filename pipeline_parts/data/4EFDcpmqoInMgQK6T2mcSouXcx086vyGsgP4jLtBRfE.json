"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Now look here, my young friend, \\\" said Vizard, holding her lovely head by both ears, \\\"you are exciting yourself about nothing, and that will end in one of your headaches. So, just take your candle, and go to bed, like a good little girl.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Must I? Well, then, I will. Goodby, tyrant dear. Oh, how I love you! Come, Fanny.\\\"\\n\\nShe gave her hand shyly to Severne, and soon they were both in Zoe's room.\\n\\nRosa was dismissed, and they had their chat; but it was nearly all on one side. Fanny had plenty to say, but did not say it. She had not the heart to cloud that beaming face again so soon; she temporized: Zoe pressed her with questions too; but she slurred things, Zoe asked her why Miss Maitland was so bitter against Mr. Severne. Fanny said, in an off-hand way, \\\"Oh, it is only on your \\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/121](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/121)\\n\\naccount she objects to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what are her objections?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, only grammatical ones, dear. She says his *antecedents* are obscure, and his *relatives* unknown, ha! ha! ha!\\\" Fanny laughed, but Zoe did not see the fun. Then Fanny stroked her down.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind that old woman. I shall interfere properly, if I see you in danger. It was monstrous her making an *esclandre* at the very dinner-table, and spoiling your happy day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But she hasn't!\\\" cried Zoe, eagerly. \\\"'All's well that ends well.' I am happy--oh, so happy! You love me. Harrington loves me. *He* loves me. What more can any woman ask for than to be *ambata bene?\\\"*\\n\\nThis was the last word between Zoe and Fanny upon St. Brooch's day.\\n\\nAs Fanny went to her own room, the vigilant Maitland opened her door that looked upon the corridor and beckoned her in. \\\"Well,\\\" said she, \\\"did you speak to Zoe?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just a word before dinner. Aunt, she came in wet, to the skin, and in higher spirits than Rosa ever knew her.\\\"\\n\\nAunt groaned.\\n\\n\\\"And what do you think? Her spoiled dress, she ordered it to be ironed and put by. *It is a case.\\\"*\\n\\nNext day they all met at a late breakfast, and good humor was the order of the day. This encouraged Zoe to throw out a feeler about the gambling-tables. Then Fanny said it must be nice to gamble, because it was so naughty. \\\"In a long experience,\\\" said Miss Dover, with a sigh, \\\"I have found that whatever is nice is naughty, and whatever is naughty is nice.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's a short code of morals,\\\" observed Vizard, \\\"for the use of seminaries. Now let us hear Severne; he knows all the defenses of gambling lunacy has discovered.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne, thus appealed to, said play was like other things, bad only when carried to excess. \\\"At Homburg, where the play is fair, what harm can there be in devoting two or three hours of a long day to *trente et quarante?* The play exercises memory, judgment, *sangfroid,* and other good qualities of the mind. Above all, it is on the square. Now, buying and selling shares without delivery, bulling, and bearing, and rigging, and Stock Exchange speculations in general, are just as much gambling; but with cards all marked, and dice loaded, and the fair player has no chance. The world,\\\" said this youthful philosopher, \\\"is taken in by words. The truth is, that gambling with cards is fair, and gambling without cards a swindle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is hard upon the City,\\\" said the Vizard; \\\"but no matter. Proceed, young man. Develop your code of morals for the amusement of mankind, while duller spirits inflict instruction.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have got my opinion,\\\" said Severne. \\\"Oblige us with yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; mine would not be popular just now: I reserve it till we are there, and can see the lunatics at work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, then we are to go,\\\" cried Fanny. \\\"Oh, be joyful!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That depends on Miss Maitland. It is not in my department.\\\"\\n\\nInstantly four bright eyes were turned piteously on the awful Maitland.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, aunt,\\\" said Zoe, pleadingly, \\\"do you think there would be any great harm in our--just for once in a way?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear,\\\" said Miss Maitland, solemnly, \\\"I cannot say that I approve of public gambling in general. But at Homburg the company is select. I have seen a German prince, a Russian prince, and two English countesses, the very *e'lite* of London society, seated at the same table in the Kursaal. I think, therefore, there can be no harm in your going, under the conduct of older persons--myself, for example, and your brother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Code three,\\\" suggested Vizard--\\\"the chaperonian code.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And a very good one, too,\\\" said Zoe. \\\"But, aunt, must we look on, or may we play just a little, little?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My dear, there can be no great harm in playing a little, in *good company*--if you play with your own money.\\\" She must have one dig at Severne.\\n\\n\\\"I shan't play very deep, then,\\\" said Fanny; \\\"for I have got no money hardly.\\\"\\n\\nVizard came to the front, like a man. \\\"No more should I,\\\" said he, \\\"but for Herries & Co. As it is, I am a Croesus, and I shall stand one hundred pounds, which you three ladies must divide; and between you, no doubt, you will break the bank.\\\"\\n\\nAcclamations greeted this piece of misogyny. When they had subsided, Severne was called on to explain the game, and show the young ladies how to win a fortune with thirty-three pounds six shillings and eight pence.\\n\\nThe table was partly cleared, two packs of cards sent for, and the professor lectured.\\n\\n\\\"This,\\\" said he, \\\"is the cream of the game. Six packs are properly shuffled, and properly cut; the players put their money on black or red, which is the main event, and is settled thus: The dealer deals the cards in two rows. He deals the *first* row for black, and stops the moment the cards pass thirty. That deal determines how near *noir* can get to thirty-one.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne then dealt for *noir,* and the cards came as follows:\\n\\nQueen of hearts--four of clubs--ten of spades--nine of diamonds: total, thirty-three.\\\"\\n\\nHe then dealt for red:\\n\\nKnave of clubs--ace of diamonds--two of spades--king of spades--nine of hearts: total, thirty-two.\\n\\n\\\"Red wins, because the cards dealt for red come nearer thirty-one. Besides that,\\\" said he, \\\"you can bet on the color, or against it. The actual color of the first card the player turns up on the black line must be black or red. Whichever happens to be it is called 'the color.' Say it is red; then, if the black line of cards wins, color loses. Now, I will deal again for both events.\\n\\n\\\"I deal for *noir.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"Nine of diamonds. Red, then, is the actual color turned up on the black line. Do you bet for it, or against it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I bet for it,\\\" cried Zoe. \\\"It's my favorite color.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what do you say on the main event?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, red on that too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very good. I go on dealing for *noir.* Queen of diamonds, three of spades, knave of hearts--nine of spades: thirty-two. That looks ugly for your two events, black coming so near as thirty-two. Now for red. Four of hearts, knave of spades, seven of diamonds, queen of clubs--thirty-one, by Jove! *Rouge gagne, et couleur.* There is nothing like courage. You have won both events.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, what a nice game!\\\" cried Zoe.\\n\\nHe then continued to deal, and they all bet on the main event and the color, staking fabulous sums, till at last both numbers came up thirty-one.\\n\\nThereupon Severne informed them that half the stakes belonged to him. That was the trifling advantage accorded to the bank.\\n\\n\\\"Which trifling advantage,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"has enriched the man-eating company, and their prince, and built the Kursaal, and will clean you all out, if you play long enough.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That,\\\" said Severne, \\\"I deny. It is more than balanced by the right the players have of doubling, till they gain, and by the maturity of the chances: I will explain this to the ladies. You see experience proves that neither red nor black can come up more than nine times running. When, therefore, either color has come up four times, you can put a moderate stake on the other color, and double on it till it *must* come, by the laws of nature. Say red has turned four times. You put a napoleon on black; red gains. You lose a napoleon. You don't remove it, but double on it. The chances are now five to one you gain: but if you lose, you double on the same, and, when you have got to sixteen napoleons, the color must change; uniformity has reached its physical limit. That is called the maturity of the chances. Begin as unluckily as possible with five francs, and lose. If you have to double eight times before you win, it only comes to twelve hundred and eighty francs. Given, therefore, a man to whom fifty napoleons are no more than five francs to us, he can never lose if he doubles, like a Trojan, till the chances are mature. This is called 'the Martingale:' but, observe, it only secures against loss. Heavy gains are made by doubling judiciously on the *winning* color, or by simply betting on short runs of it. When red comes up, back red, and double twice on it. Thus you profit by the remarkable and observed fact that colors do not, as a rule, alternate, but reach ultimate equality by avoiding alternation, and making short runs, with occasional long runs; the latter are rare, and must be watched with a view to the balancing run of the other color. This is my system.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you really think you have invented it?\\\" asked Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"I am not so conceited. My system was communicated to me, in the Kursaal itself--by an old gentleman.\\\"\\n\\n*\\\"An* old gentleman, or *the*--?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Harrington,\\\" cried Zoe, \\\"fie!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My wit is appreciated at its value. Proceed, Ned.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne told him, a little defiantly, it was an old gentleman, with a noble head, a silvery beard, and the most benevolent countenance he ever saw.\\n\\n\\\"Curious place for his reverence to be in,\\\" hazarded Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"He saw me betting, first on the black, then on the red, till I was cleaned out, and then he beckoned me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not a man of premature advice anyway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He told me he had observed my play. I had been relying on the alternations of the colors, which alternation chance persistently avoids, and arrives at equality by runs. He then gave me a better system.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And, having expounded his system, he illustrated it? Tell the truth now; he sat down and lost the coat off his back? It followed his family acres.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are quite wrong again. He never plays. He has heart-disease, and his physician has forbidden him all excitement.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"His nation?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Humph! French.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637668479,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"That is not enough, nor half.
