"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\n　　Fate is determined by character, and character is determined by knowledge, desire and habit. If a person wants to change his fate, he has to change his character first; and if he wants to change his character, he has to change his knowledge or his desires and habits. Complaining to other people or the environments makes no sense.\\n　　Actually, everybody in this world will know about the meaning of life. It’s just the matter of time. A worker, who had just lost his job, met a university professor one day. He admitted that he didn’t love to study when he was a student. He just hated to study no matter what and how his father asked him to. When he got a job and became a worker, he realized how important to have knowledge in this world. But, it was too late…\\n　　There are no parents who don’t think studying is important for their children, and all the parents tell their children to study hard. We, however, still have so much difference on different children, on the results, that we finally will know it’ is the matter of self-control.\\n　　When we are kids in a primary school, we see no difference from each other. We just know somebody is good at Chinese, Math or Sports. We just know that the teacher likes him or her. Nowadays, we differentiate our classmates by their parents. We say: oh, god, his father is the vice mayor, his father is very rich; his mother is the dean of the biggest hospital…. This is definitely not a good sign for China and the Chinese people, because it makes no competition for the youngsters, who are having China’s future in hand.\\n　　The poor always hate the rich, because they see the rich driving all the luxury cars, living in condominiums, villas and spending money like they are countless. And the poor see the rich always on vocations, always so relaxed and enjoyable. So the poor are jealous and they wonder how can the rich be so rich and the poor are so poor. Well, the poor obviously forget one thing: When the rich are working hard and smart to collect money, the poor are lying somewhere and making complains.\\n　　Make your fate and success in control; you can make a difference in the future, unless you want to a poor person, both mentally and physically.\",\"timestamp\":1639398074,\"title\":\"Make your fate in control\"},\"digest\":\"1q4-VNgQ3_8Pt8URyr9jDB7eDccszYNsfUoEBDmBq4c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc7c8Fa917D383cBc649ea2C6397A5ad9456F60C9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rFdtqJfghk_St2S9HeJpDTJ54qlmbhFmZAZD9v-wWCg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4mNWbcQHUgks9_PNTPjADAzeXXFf2UkLISmPCelyt8E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"m1q7m3TK8laSoABspv13tNX57qro3frHOqqSLJjAeEJWYnoiMwMpsu_yXJzqVvFAzfyctVRwxlgM1LHIvypCbg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x263eaba9efc27e0ecc495b40ac309819bd00c6b58daace1c412de513f861d58d3b32873f7ebfca7527a0bfad5367e0de68136265be433b8cd6e9b71a61e7ba181c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rFdtqJfghk_St2S9HeJpDTJ54qlmbhFmZAZD9v-wWCg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4mNWbcQHUgks9_PNTPjADAzeXXFf2UkLISmPCelyt8E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1q4-VNgQ3_8Pt8URyr9jDB7eDccszYNsfUoEBDmBq4c\"}"
