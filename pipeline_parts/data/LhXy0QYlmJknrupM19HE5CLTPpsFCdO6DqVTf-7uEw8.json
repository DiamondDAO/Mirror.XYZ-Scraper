"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have many friends, but Jim is one of my best friends. He is not handsome, but kind-hearted. We know each other at primary school. He was the tallest in our class at that time. He is good at study and playing basketball, while bad at playing table tennis. Everytime he has delicious food, he will give it to me. Moreover, whenever I feel sad, he will play with me and comfort me. However, he is not spoilt me. For example, everytime I meet difficulties in study, I would like to copy his, but no matter what I say, he never give his homework to me to copy. Instead he teaches how to do it. All in all, no matter what difficulties I meet, he will help me. It is him make me realize that a friend in need is a friend indeed.\",\"timestamp\":1639120197,\"title\":\"My Best Friend\"},\"digest\":\"NjqHMjBHDPY_W924xnQr8Vn7hEb4YwdjTX2lPbHP4vg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x85d527Bd511fd0162d2Bb6379c0BBe0e4Bf35799\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W36rUXaz4QfwXlMZCHXtduiRmVNpQ2aGKqmD1Z9ButU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4wA2aln0GtpNYQGziyUpLQEaRbSIwBxUwAIfhaCo_3Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"39gSBG8h1nBkSSUNss1HQxwLOPk8VpzetRWHSReRiqzOmfvCFtGn_9MqvvnZnWwqrS7DOTBK0QkYsYAJUWjpHQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0cce23af29e3ceace92ee5735d836a74d15551e84e01a54ba3ba45bbd7a0f27c3dbed4b2ce8fdfc57690b0e861be0d84c60a54ab6f5773a289cb8cce4614e4f91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W36rUXaz4QfwXlMZCHXtduiRmVNpQ2aGKqmD1Z9ButU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4wA2aln0GtpNYQGziyUpLQEaRbSIwBxUwAIfhaCo_3Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NjqHMjBHDPY_W924xnQr8Vn7hEb4YwdjTX2lPbHP4vg\"}"
