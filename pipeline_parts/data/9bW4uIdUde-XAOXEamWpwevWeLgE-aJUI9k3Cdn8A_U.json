"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"After many months without travel, the 20-month COVID-19 travel ban was finally lifted to the United States, affecting all non-U.S. citizens from over 30 countries. With countries slowly reopening, travel has once again become top of mind to the world, with expectations that more and more countries will begin loosening their restrictions in response to the actions of the U.S.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with a rising number of people looking to travel again, prices are following closely behind.

Everyone deserves to travel, and BitBook is making this reality possible by rewarding people who book through their site, invite others or create compelling content.\\n\\nOperating with a community focus, BitBook is making travel rewarding in more ways than experience, with a diverse set of offerings that now include access to over 400,000 hotels, over 300 airlines and car rentals from Hertz and Sixtz.\\n\\n## Competing in the traditional market\\n\\nBitBook was founded by a knowledgeable team of technical experts, including two of the executives from KuCoin. Upon looking at the current travel industry, they noticed that blockchain technology could present a very real opportunity to compete in a market dominated by two major players, the Expedia group and Booking holdings, who currently account for over 90% of the market share.\",\"timestamp\":1639121656,\"title\":\"Blockchain-based booking platform allows everyone to experience travel\"},\"digest\":\"4Ojtg3LKXOfSw0wQw-q_C47gK9RHrhLmVt_greLWAho\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x736130a420bc991cf9e6489450Cc65Bf01281210\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OkN7dStKQhZevwt4-mI9Qe0VLRtk0ob2JvmWzYG9CBI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f3odNTITGUhDW85WJmQrbIC7aJqGzbx1fz63y1shjKQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Q0Wpe266tJgK-vlGZLVodWKfh_MiDjA_YCt5-VTBfIcIe9xys_AQon-9HUxJCJ9Du71Z4acsKKJrexOA9UEi6Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x12ab1dc90e3ca658ecdd1885050835460f6449662a3e90ae612f5c2c638812a94c4fc0e24d6a616d309f6ae29ee4a8fa3d70f06d15168a89ad468d5c0b78f7421c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OkN7dStKQhZevwt4-mI9Qe0VLRtk0ob2JvmWzYG9CBI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f3odNTITGUhDW85WJmQrbIC7aJqGzbx1fz63y1shjKQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4Ojtg3LKXOfSw0wQw-q_C47gK9RHrhLmVt_greLWAho\"}"
