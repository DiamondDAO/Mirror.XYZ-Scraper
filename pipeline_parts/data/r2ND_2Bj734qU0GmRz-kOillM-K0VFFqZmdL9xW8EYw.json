We want to make sure the projects we list on Launchpad are the highest quality and here for the long term.\\n\\nDanny AKA Coolman Coffeedan and his collection Coolman's Universe checked all the boxes.\\n\\nFollowing the success of this video, Danny continued creating animations in his unique style, generating over 10 million followers and hundreds of millions of views around the world.\\n\\nDanny has been building his world of characters for over 5 years and it's hard to watch his creations without smiling:\\n\\n> \\n> [https://youtu.be/0HXMYm4k6w0](https://youtu.be/0HXMYm4k6w0)\\n\\n\\n```\\n<iframe width=\\\"560\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o2IJaj3nUmU\\\" title=\\\"YouTube video player\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allow=\\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n```\\n\\nSo when he was taking his first steps into NFTs, we wanted to be involved.\\n\\nWe see massive potential in the project and are partnering with Dan to build out his Coolman's Universe NFT collection, starting here on Metalink Launchpad.\\n\\nIf you already own a Punk, Ape, Cat, or Kong, head on over to Launchpad to claim your 'Allow List' spot.\\n\\nIf you don't have access to Metalink today, fomo not. We've got more exciting projects coming down the pipeline and you *will* have access to the next ones‚Ä¶¬† so stay tuned!\\n\\nDEATH TO THE WHITELIST\\n\\nQuick word about words.\\n\\nTo us, web 3 and NFTs represent the emergence of a new world that is more open and inclusive. To us, this is a chance to shed some of the relics of the past and establish new standards for the future.\\n\\nWe've always felt that the term 'whitelist' goes against the ethos of web 3.\\n\\nWhitelist is not an inclusive term... yet it's used throughout our space.\\n\\nToday, Metalink announces death to the term \\\"whitelist\\\".\\n\\nAs our Launchpad rolls out, we will be using the words \\\"allow list\\\" to promote more openness and inclusion. We encourage other projects and their communities to follow suit if they feel compelled. Together, we can do it.
