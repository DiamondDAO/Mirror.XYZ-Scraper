"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Experiment Overview\\n\\nThere are dozens of components that comprise an effective analytics bounty program including; sourcing and prioritizing questions, structuring bounties and setting difficulty levels for different analysts to solve, providing data access across multiple data platforms to achieve sufficient results, and quality control on outcomes, to name just a few.\\n\\nOn November 5th, we laid out the details of [our first experiment](https://mirror.xyz/0x3138165f8d21d4869dbD406CD8bc8055CAC8fb6E/t4G_DWaDeNyaBcmrTLBsDgfIhi6uJM4revXfw8plLus): sourcing bounty questions.\\n\\nTwo conflicting needs come into play when sourcing bounty questions. On one hand, efficiency and progressing quickly is key. The crypto space moves at such a fast pace that the right insights needed today might not be the most relevant in two weeks.\\n\\nAt the same time, we need the broader community’s input, which easily slows things down. Only the community can best determine which insights should be prioritized today, but getting a large number of people to agree on anything is always tricky.\\n\\nBuilding the question vault was our attempt at combining both efficiency and community participation.\\n\\nFocused on OlympusDAO, the community was asked to submit bounty questions and then vote on the ones submitted. The most upvoted questions will then be turned into paid bounties for analysts to work on. Users who submitted a question via the question vault received a POAP.\\n\\n# Outcomes\\n\\n### 38 Questions in 24 Hours\\n\\nThe turnout was awesome. Over 40 questions were submitted for OlympusDAO in 48 hours and enough people voted that 10 top submissions were selected as bounties for the project.\\n\\n### A Need for More Educational Material on the Project\\n\\nSeveral people said they didn’t know enough about Olympus to engage with it. We recognize that it’s hard to come up with analytics questions when you are still trying to grasp what the project is about.\\n\\nWith that in mind, we want to provide more educational content and training about the protocol that we’re launching ahead of time. [Academy.Shrimpy](https://academy.shrimpy.io/post/what-is-olympus-dao-ohm-explaining-the-3-3-meme-bonding-and-stablecoins) and [this video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZodrK_V8Fw&t=48s) are a great place to start! \\n\\n### Next Up: Harmony!\\n\\nWe are currently generating questions for Harmony! Head over to [the question vault](https://bounty.metricsdao.xyz/bounty-programs/harmony) to submit your ideas for bounty questions.\\n\\nWhat educational material should we provide for Harmony?
