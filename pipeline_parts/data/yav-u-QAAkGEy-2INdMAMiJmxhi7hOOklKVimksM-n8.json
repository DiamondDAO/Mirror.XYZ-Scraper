"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Morocco**,[\\\\[a\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-15) officially the **Kingdom of Morocco**,[\\\\[b\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-16) is the northwesternmost country in the [Maghreb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maghreb) region of [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa). It overlooks the [Mediterranean Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea) to the north and the [Atlantic Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean) to the west, and has land borders with [Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria) to [the east](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algeria%E2%80%93Morocco_border), and the disputed territory of [Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara) to [the south](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco%E2%80%93Western_Sahara_border). Morocco also claims the [Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain) exclaves of [Ceuta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceuta), [Melilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melilla) and [Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe%C3%B1%C3%B3n_de_V%C3%A9lez_de_la_Gomera), and several small [Spanish-controlled islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plazas_de_soberan%C3%ADa) off its coast.[\\\\[13\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-17) It spans an area of 446,550 km2 (172,410 sq mi) or 710,850 km2 (274,460 sq mi),[\\\\[b\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#endnote_Territory) with a population of roughly 37 million. Its official and predominant religion is [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam), and the official languages are [Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic) and [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_languages); the [Moroccan dialect of Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Arabic) and [French](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_language) are also widely spoken. [Moroccan identity and culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Morocco) is a vibrant mix of [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers), [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_culture), and [European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_Europe) cultures. Its capital is [Rabat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabat), while its largest city is [Casablanca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casablanca).[\\\\[14\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-Abun-Nasr1987-18)\\n\\nInhabited since the [Paleolithic Era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic) over 90,000 years ago, the [first Moroccan state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idrisid_dynasty) was established by [Idris I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idris_I_of_Morocco) in 788. It was subsequently ruled by a series of independent dynasties, reaching its zenith as a [regional power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_power) in the 11th and 12th centuries, under the [Almoravid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty) and [Almohad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate) dynasties, when it controlled most of the [Iberian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iberian_Peninsula) and the Maghreb.[\\\\[15\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-19) In the 15th and 16th centuries, Morocco faced external threats to its sovereignty, with [Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_Empire) seizing some territory and the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire) encroaching from the east. The [Marinid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marinid_Sultanate) and [Saadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadi_Sultanate) dynasties otherwise resisted foreign domination, and Morocco was the only North African nation to escape Ottoman dominion. The [Alaouite dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaouite_dynasty), which rules the country to this day, seized power in 1631, and over the next two centuries expanded diplomatic and commercial relations with the [Western world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_world). Morocco's strategic location near the mouth of the Mediterranean drew renewed European interest; in 1912, France and Spain divided the country into [respective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Protectorate_in_Morocco) [protectorates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_protectorate_in_Morocco), reserving an [international zone in Tangier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tangier_International_Zone). Following intermittent riots and revolts against colonial rule, in 1956 Morocco regained its independence and reunified.\\n\\nSince independence, Morocco has remained relatively stable and prosperous. It has the [fifth-largest economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_African_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)) in Africa and wields significant influence in both Africa and the [Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world); it is considered a [middle power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_power) in global affairs and holds membership in the [Arab League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_League), the [Union for the Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_for_the_Mediterranean), and the [African Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union).[\\\\[16\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-20) Morocco is a [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_state) semi-[constitutional monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_monarchy) with an elected parliament. The [executive branch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_(government)) is led by the [King of Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rulers_of_Morocco) and the [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Morocco), while [legislative power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislature) is vested in the two chambers of parliament: the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives_(Morocco)) and the [House of Councillors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Councillors_(Morocco)). Judicial power rests with the Constitutional Court, which may review the validity of laws, elections, and referenda.[\\\\[17\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco#cite_note-21) The king holds vast executive and legislative powers, especially over the [military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Moroccan_Armed_Forces), foreign policy and religious affairs; he can issue decrees called *[dahirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moroccan_Dahir)*, which have the force of law, and can also dissolve the parliament after consulting the [prime minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_heads_of_government_of_Morocco) and the president of the constitutional court.\\n\\nMorocco claims ownership of the [non-self-governing territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_list_of_Non-Self-Governing_Territories) of [Western Sahara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara), which it has designated its [Southern Provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Provinces). In 1975, after Spain [agreed to decolonise the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Accords) and cede its control to Morocco and [Mauritania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritania), a [guerrilla war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_War) broke out between those powers and some of the [local inhabitants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sahrawi_people). In 1979, Mauritania relinquished [its claim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiris_al-Gharbiyya) to the area, but the war continued to rage. In 1991, a ceasefire agreement was reached, but the issue of sovereignty remained unresolved. Today, Morocco occupies two-thirds of the territory, and [efforts to resolve the dispute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sahara_peace_process) have thus far failed to break the political deadlock.\",\"timestamp\":1635436607,\"title\":\"Morocco\"},\"digest\":\"f7IFi-1t_qoSXBCcWCHr2ivx2PgLbeMwXEvuyQX74fA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0330cD101DE288F4B0DF2dd5eE66AF10a50A063d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OnaYQ8GsqW80b-TNh1To_6jCO-erCk2A63Dnz0RgUxs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kuGFpMZWyDvNGxF60jLe4kERJvcgp9-iJWtezTR0XXg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ltt1ltDKAQ1KaNoR7DqivX4wYkudqjTlRITd9yZg1ajZ2mXwO977OUaWn3JnrEEiDJawyzupN_iNiOWVPbwWYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xdb5e378611395f5d4cca8a1dfaab99a92423e741cfc2281734f61038a1bee72b6f9633ea6f298b5230425d0fdfe2c570b42cb0ceebedef5bdf5c44791de97d641c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"OnaYQ8GsqW80b-TNh1To_6jCO-erCk2A63Dnz0RgUxs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kuGFpMZWyDvNGxF60jLe4kERJvcgp9-iJWtezTR0XXg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"f7IFi-1t_qoSXBCcWCHr2ivx2PgLbeMwXEvuyQX74fA\"}"
