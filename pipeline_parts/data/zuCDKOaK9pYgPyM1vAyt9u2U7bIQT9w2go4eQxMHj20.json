"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Celo is a Blockchain built with the PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism and compatible with the Ethereum virtual machine (EVM Compatible), allowing Dapps built on the Ethereum platform to be easily deployed on Celo.\\n\\nThe special feature of Celo compared to other EVM Compatible Blockchain such as BSC, Polygon, Heco, etc. lies in the fact that this is the first Mobile-blockchain project on the market.\\n\\nSpecifically about Mobile-blockchain:\\n\\nThe Celo protocol provides incentives for running full nodes on each mobile device. Unlike other Proof-of-Stake systems.\\n\\nUsers can still earn coins or tokens by providing computing resources (computing power) without needing to stake other Crypto assets.\\n\\nIn addition, with the vision of being a Mobile-blockchain, Celo will provide solutions to help users experience DeFi in the simplest way with just their mobile devices.\\n\\nSome highlights of Celo can be mentioned as:\\n\\nSupport many different currencies for payment needs.\\n\\nAccount linked to phone number.\\n\\nMultiple options for paying transaction fees (transaction fees can be paid in CELO, CUSD, CEUR, etc.).\\n\\nSync instantly even on slow connections.\\n\\nCelo's General Vision\\n\\nThe platform is built with the aim of helping anyone with a mobile phone to access financial instruments such as payment, savings, investment, etc. through Blockchain technology.\\n\\nYou can read the Recap article about the AMA between the Coin98 community and Celo's representative – Evan Kereiakes to better understand the vision that the Celo team is aiming for here.\\n\\nIn short, you can imagine an overview of the Celo ecosystem that will be built as follows:\\n\\nAn ecosystem with a central product, Mobile Wallet\\n\\nStarting with the platform is Blockchain Celo with the ability to develop products on it.\\n\\nNext, the solution of the Celo team is aimed at helping people access financial services with just a Smartphone. So the center of the Celo ecosystem will be Mobile Wallet.\\n\\nEventually financial services platforms will be built and integrated directly into Mobile Wallet.\\n\\nBackers\\n\\nCelo owns a pretty powerful backers\\n\\nCelo owns a strong team of developers and Backers, including some very famous names in the market such as a16z, Coinbase Venture, Polychain Capital, Jack Dorsey, …\",\"timestamp\":1638430248,\"title\":\"Overview of the Celo ecosystem\"},\"digest\":\"ckMrHdkAecGAOatG8Fr_unBFrLVTSRmwLGpeCc9MOuM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7F92140d650EcCb4f1ce37456a7E0bB7ce323F61\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kLsdO6_h9IsnrEJ8a4yM1SfWsUQBuYWoalyDkGv6QZY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UwlX2NKd-FLclV1Sd-UzZ6grvn0sloYl8gXw6w2Ey5k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pf-aqgzrtxy6AzJUcxsiT5peDvPIoj4xIat3yKa4m7m2KTsezHyF3SfMRJrW9Kv7IzXhGBOA4oG_npLeahPFbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc32a74b084b7c8b2628e3e4414757d6a94e29696cd783ee0d6dfbd56ff13035912dcbf0f77393294248472e43e241041aa4a0f231874096f0ca4865e9b0eb9be1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kLsdO6_h9IsnrEJ8a4yM1SfWsUQBuYWoalyDkGv6QZY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UwlX2NKd-FLclV1Sd-UzZ6grvn0sloYl8gXw6w2Ey5k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ckMrHdkAecGAOatG8Fr_unBFrLVTSRmwLGpeCc9MOuM\"}"
