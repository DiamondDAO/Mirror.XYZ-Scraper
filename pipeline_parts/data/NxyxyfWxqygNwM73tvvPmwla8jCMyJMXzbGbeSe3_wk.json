They face a dilemma of dwelling narrowly or renting a room.\\n\\nPeople holding the idea of purchasing a house think that the advantages of owning a house of their own outweigh another choice.

On the other hand, a house belonging to yourself makes you feel safety and comfort. Nevertheless, dissenters do not agree with the idea. In their view, the house price is too high to afford for graduates. If graduates decide to buy a house, they are certain to increase the burden of their family.\\n\\nIn my opinion, it is more advisable to rent a house during the first years than to buy a house because it is unwise to buy a house at such a high price. Surely, graduates can decide when to buy a house in accordance with their family condition.\",\"timestamp\":1641014154,\"title\":\"Should a College Graduate Rent or Purchase a House?\"},\"digest\":\"dr7Ftpo_YnZRuI_KPxAIx0CfiRzmskyOrarE06eDF_w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7d1361A65d6d6e83C846f011dc5C2AbB069334A0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qyyZcKYAFlDZGIxckYGBZRhd8Jr2Mnl7OM66KS0In94\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U7BpJAbLhv6gPYDToQ7TeBU3urKccYUKChmJrV9cKQc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RHtS_Dr3IUiP8spwAoa-EXhiIf3oDGvjynBai83xiwTIpCqZ8gSt8LBz07hkpLP7C8JQYtdIlxwsyoPs2Rdmmw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbc820c2872fea2b0bc275941c3341db43bf10765b5c9a19fa49f04b9c98760214f40d5d6dcf26ba7dfee38ba8a6d38a1585252ec8d39ab5b1b5af0473512f4241b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qyyZcKYAFlDZGIxckYGBZRhd8Jr2Mnl7OM66KS0In94\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U7BpJAbLhv6gPYDToQ7TeBU3urKccYUKChmJrV9cKQc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dr7Ftpo_YnZRuI_KPxAIx0CfiRzmskyOrarE06eDF_w\"}"
