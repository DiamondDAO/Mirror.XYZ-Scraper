"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Everyone is lonely\\n\\n \\n\\nI don't remember which writer said: \\\"sitting on the train of the times, everyone is lonely.\\\" The first time I saw this sentence, it deeply touched my heart.\\n\\nLife is really just like that one-way train. You can't control its progress, and you are the only one on this train. Because this is your life.\\n\\nLong ago, I really knew that \\\"nothing will last forever\\\", and no one will accompany you to the end. You, me and him are all alone. Each of us comes to this strange world alone and then leaves naked. No matter what kind of person you are, no matter what joy and joy you have in front of others, you will still cry alone until dawn in the night alone.\\n\\n \\n\\nSometimes we feel that no one really understands ourselves, just like a nightingale blooming and withering quietly. Xiao Si said, \\\"the excitement is the excitement of others. My loneliness fights each other in the underground dark city of the night.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nHundred years of solitude\\n\\n \\n\\n\\\"The past is false. Memory is a road without a way back. All the past spring can not be restored. Even the most frenzied and tenacious love is in the final analysis just a fleeting reality, only loneliness and eternity.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nMarquez's hundred years of solitude is a book that makes me love and cry. Love its prosperity, love its loneliness.\\n\\n \\n\\nOpen the window of your heart, and the breeze comes from you\\n\\n \\n\\nEveryone has a window in his heart. If you don't open it, others will never get in.\\n\\n \\n\\nWe all know that one day, all prosperity will fade, and the people around us will come and go. In fact, the happiness everyone brings you is eternal. Parents, brothers, sisters or partners will leave you and hug themselves when you are lonely.\\n\\n \\n\\nSee through, then relieved. \\\"Even if we think our feelings have dried up and can't be given, there will always be a moment when something can stir the strings in our hearts. After all, we are not born to enjoy loneliness.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nOpen your heart\\n\\n \\n\\nPut aside all the noise and noise, open that window, loneliness will be lonely and full, but your heart needs to be exposed to the sun. Garcia Marquez said: \\\"life is a wonderful thing invented by people.\\\"\\n\\n \\n\\nDon't close yourself in a small circle. Life has infinite beauty and possibilities. You shouldn't miss it because you walk with your head down.\",\"timestamp\":1639148030,\"title\":\"LOINLY\"},\"digest\":\"wGx8OtT9zg4dPIzV3SO95yTjWXTuIcqCTnRTeGuwmSE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x32D8930F849aC25c617Dd388D80216750e4d2Fbc\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PdjHrMqJ-VTPJ1gzqTkyXRduqHNwTQM6pCboWgBswJk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2g28Tox_D71BQjrEI26BmhwlZwCaFokuYWQAD0zDwqk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3jxTBiiGtnOdN8GSPAdKw2tbOHW_fo8RIIHV5RmiCONf7X48uFfOUOfkl9nlFsC6MU74_cPu5mkz_TCQyIcMqw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xadc3b3f3553e5a3347ed220d62fbabd36196f386cde88f680fd21824ace382e660aea5d09cc91d3764b24060f9534d405a50c8300a2081111ad21b4ae8260ed01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PdjHrMqJ-VTPJ1gzqTkyXRduqHNwTQM6pCboWgBswJk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2g28Tox_D71BQjrEI26BmhwlZwCaFokuYWQAD0zDwqk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wGx8OtT9zg4dPIzV3SO95yTjWXTuIcqCTnRTeGuwmSE\"}"
