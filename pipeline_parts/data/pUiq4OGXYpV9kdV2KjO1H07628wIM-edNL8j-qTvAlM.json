The two parties will jointly explore the possibilities of technology integrations, and work together to build a cross-chain DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nConnext is a network that enables sending value and calling contracts across Ethereum-compatible chains and L2s.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, Arbitrum, Optimism, Moonriver and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + Connext\\n\\nBy integrating Connext’s interoperability network, WePiggy would be one more closer to the cross-chain lending network.\\n\\nWePiggy will first add an entrance in its application to [xPollinate](https://www.xpollinate.io/), a cross-chain bridge application powered by Connext, to give users an alternative solution for bridging their assets between different networks.\\n\\nOn the basis of mutual benefit between the two communities, more cooperation will be carried out, including co-marketing campaigns, cross-chain liquidity building, cross-chain collateral repayment and user asset appreciation, etc.\\n\\n***“Connext provides a secure and powerful cross-chain infrastructure to Dapps and normal users. WePiggy will work together with Connext step by step to bring users the cross-chain DeFi lending network. Also, through this cooperation, we can expand WePiggy’s influence to a larger user base.”***\\n\\n– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy\\n\\n***“We are very excited to partner up with WePiggy and help them onboard more users as they expand across more Ethereum-compatible chains and L2s. Connext is playing an important role in bridging liquidity for WePiggy’s lending protocol, by allowing its users to onboard and offboard from any chain of their choice while still being able to use WePiggy. Both projects will be working more closely soon to build the ultimate cross-chain lending experience.”***\\n\\n– Arjun Bhuptani, Founder and CEO of Connext\\n\\n## **About WePiggy**\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol.
