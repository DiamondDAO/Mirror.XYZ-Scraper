"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I remember that my earliest experience of participating in DEFI started from UNI. At that time, I knew that individuals could become a platform for automatic market makers, which allowed me to feel a sense of belonging to a project for the first time, instead of simply buying and selling trading coins. Various financial agreements began to explode around this automatic market maker. CRV and AAVE have also developed and grown because of this. However, for a single currency agency agreement, the mining currency will always be mined, resulting in the formation of mining and sales. When the income is not up to expectations or a new defi agreement appears, it is easy to change the existing fund transfer. The relationship between the participants of defi and the power of platform governance is very fragile.\\n\\nI first heard that the concept of DEFI2.0 was due to the soaring OlympusDAO which caused strong market attention and discussion. Therefore, I also participated in some and learned about the consensus of 3.3 for the first time. I think this consensus will even follow. Consensus is mainstream. It is no longer a simple digging and selling. Only by adhering to the 3.3 consensus can you participate in the fun of this project to the greatest extent. OHM's vision is to become a bank on the chain, but its consensus model requires continuous capital supply growth. Therefore, the lower the pledge rate, the higher the APY. This will attract more people to pledge, thereby generating continuous purchasing power to maintain his Consensus, this single model requires a strong cohesive community, but people are profit-seeking. Once there are other ohm forks that can generate a higher rate of return in a short time, it will cause the loss of funds, which may Can not achieve a virtuous positive cycle.\\n\\nAlthough I don't know if Concave will be the next DEFI3.0 (in fact, I personally think it is the 2.5 version). The Chinese translation of Concave is concave. It is not a simple fork. From the meaning of the Chinese text, I think it is more like a cistern. The Concave cast by users can continue to accumulate and grow in the treasury, and it can absorb from Various chains, not the current forks on a single chain. Instead, it can be used as an aggregator. The lack of liquidity in many current forks may find an answer on Concave. It is not only a simple fork, but the vision should be that the future can include OHM for the current forks. Produce a back-feeding effect and boost the strength of the 3.3 consensus. Let us look forward to it.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nUlVsQiZmVkSpxTW4LF2J.jpg?height=619&width=507)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638276771,\"title\":\"Review my DEFI experience and talk about why I am more optimistic about Concave\"},\"digest\":\"v09iWjxC5ymsTe9bzk9iOAq-veMJDTdFKnKGiw0KzDg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3c5F216890E3015c4Ed658EEc425bC9306B38eA3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_V_BCcah5IeGHYGSZE8WNXxzljXjRPVqF4E1QVdWMXs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"efg4qqb0FeapXP2TIaGtiPtCu3qHDTJcMppu-84IhWg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6C2dJ0fQ-L4KltRSyXQxG2G6jcD8dGaJZX5t1QgWRx-0VyArOBzUviJ3agT42qpAJOPFMWTP8vUY8aiE_JRBDg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb58f685bc3279f382cc5808cd9ce8eb12a742962aa13d1d3287dc1d5fb1c168a1beba1a6c40e9583b6e4d5cbd1d7ddfa5fe91ec0a65834f020d18cb3024c32f11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_V_BCcah5IeGHYGSZE8WNXxzljXjRPVqF4E1QVdWMXs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"efg4qqb0FeapXP2TIaGtiPtCu3qHDTJcMppu-84IhWg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"v09iWjxC5ymsTe9bzk9iOAq-veMJDTdFKnKGiw0KzDg\"}"
