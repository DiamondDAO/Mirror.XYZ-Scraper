"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"How odd! Why did you not stay another week? Gentlemen are so impatient. Never mind, that is an old story now. Here we are; those are the cottages. The workmen are at dinner. Ten to one the enthusiast is there: this is her time. You stay here. I'll go and see.\\\"\\n\\nShe went off on tiptoe, and peeped and pried here and there, like a young witch. Presently she took a few steps toward him, with her finger mysteriously to her lips, and beckoned him. He entered into the pantomime--she seemed so earnest in it--and came to her softly.\\n\\n\\\"Do just take a peep in at that opening for a door,\\\" said she, \\\"then you'll see her; her back is turned. She is lovely; only, you know, she has been ill, and I don't think she is very happy.\\\"\\n\\nUxmoor thought this peeping at enthusiasts rather an odd proceeding, but Miss Gale had primed his curiosity, and he felt naturally proud of a female pupil. He stepped up lightly, looked in at the door, and, to his amazement, saw Zoe Vizard sitting on a carpenter's bench, with her lovely head in the sun's rays. He started, then gazed, then devoured her with his eyes.\\n\\nWhat! was this his pupil?\\n\\nHow gentle and sad she seemed! All his stoicism melted at the sight of her. She sat in a sweet, pensive attitude, pale and drooping, but, to his fancy, lovelier than ever. She gave a little sigh. His heart yearned. She took out a letter, read it slowly, and said, softly and slowly, \\\"Poor fellow!\\\" He thought he recognized his own handwriting, and could stand no more. He rushed, in, and was going to speak to her; but she screamed, and no conjurer ever made a card disappear quicker than she did that letter, as she bounded away like a deer, and stood, blushing scarlet, and palpitating all over.\\n\\nUxmoor was ashamed of his *brusquerie.* \\\"What a brute I am to frighten you like this!\\\" said he. \\\"Pray forgive me; but the sight of you, after all these weary months--and you said 'Poor fellow!'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did I?\\\" said Zoe, faintly, looking scared.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, sweet Zoe, and you were reading a letter.\\\"\\n\\nNo reply.\\n\\n\\\"I thought the poor fellow might be myself. Not that I am to be pitied, if you think of me still.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do, then--very often. Oh, Lord Uxmoor, I want to go down on my knees to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is odd, now; for it is exactly what I should like to do to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What for? It is I who have behaved so ill.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never mind that; I love you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you mustn't. You must love some worthy person.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you leave that to me. I have no other intention. But may I just see whose letter you were reading?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, pray don't ask me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I insist on knowing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will not tell you. There it is.\\\" She gave it to him with a guilty air, and hid her face.\\n\\n\\\"Dear Zoe, suppose I were to repeat the offer I made here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I advise you not,\\\" said she, all in a flurry.\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because. Because--I might say 'Yes.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then I'll take my chance once more. Zoe, will you try and love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Try? I believe I do love you, or nearly. I think of you very often.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you will do something to make me happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Anything; everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Will you marry me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that I will,\\\" said Zoe, almost impetuously; \\\"and then,\\\" with a grand look of conscious beauty, \\\"I can *make* you forgive me.\\\"\\n\\nUxmoor, on this, caught her in his arms, and kissed her with such fire that she uttered a little stifled cry of alarm; but it was soon followed by a sigh of complacency, and she sunk, resistless, on his manly breast.\\n\\nSo, after two sieges, he carried that fair citadel by assault.\\n\\nThen let not the manly heart despair, nor take a mere brace of \\\"Noes\\\" from any woman. Nothing short of three negatives is serious.\\n\\nThey walked out in arm-in-arm and very close to each other; and he left her, solemnly engaged.\\n\\nLeaving this pair to the delights of courtship, and growing affection on Zoe's side--for a warm attachment of the noblest kind did grow, by degrees, out of her penitence, and esteem, and desire to repair her fault--I must now take up the other thread of this narrative, and apologize for having inverted the order of events; for it was, in reality, several days after this happy scene that Mademoiselle Klosking sent for Miss Gale.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXII.\\n\\nVIZARD, then, with Ashmead, returned home in despair; and Zoe, now happy in her own mind, was all tenderness and sisterly consolation. They opened their hearts to each other, and she showed her wish to repay the debt she owed him. How far she might have succeeded, in time, will never be known. For he had hardly been home a week, when Miss Gale returned, all in black, and told him Severne was dead and buried.\\n\\nHe was startled, and even shocked, remembering old times; but it was not in human nature he should be sorry. Not to be indecorously glad at so opportune an exit was all that could be expected from him.\\n\\nWhen she had given him the details, his first question was, \\\"How did she bear it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She is terribly cut up--more than one would think possible; for she was ice and marble to him before he was hurt to death.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is she?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gone to London. She will write to me, I suppose--poor dear. But one must give her time.\\\"\\n\\nFrom that hour Vizard was in a state of excitement, hoping to hear from Ina Klosking, or about her; but unwilling, from delicacy, to hurry matters.\\n\\nAt last he became impatient, and wrote to Ashmead, whose address he had, and said, frankly, he had a delicacy in intruding on Mademoiselle Klosking, in her grief. Yet his own feelings would not allow him to seem to neglect her. Would Mr. Ashmead, then, tell him where she was, as she had not written to any one in Barfordshire--not even to her tried friend, Miss Gale.\\n\\nHe received an answer by return of post.\\n\\n\\\"DEAR SIR--I am grieved to tell you that Mademoiselle Klosking has retired from public life. She wrote to me, three weeks ago, from Dover, requesting me to accept, as a token of her esteem, the surplus money I hold in hand for her--I always drew her salary--and bidding me farewell. The sum included her profits by psalmody, minus her expenses, and was so large it could never have been intended as a mere recognition of my humble services; and I think I have seldom felt so down-hearted as on receiving this princely donation. It has enabled me to take better offices, and it may be the foundation of a little fortune; but I feel that I have lost the truly great lady who has made a man of me. Sir, the relish is gone for my occupation: I can never be so happy as I was in working the interests of that great genius, whose voice made our leading soprani sound like whistles, and who honored me with her friendship. Sir, she was not like other leading ladies. She never bragged, never spoke ill of any one; and *you* can testify to her virtue and her discretion.\\n\\n\\\"I am truly sorry to learn from you that she has written to no one in Barfordshire. I saw, by her letter to me, she had left the stage; but her dropping you all looks as if she had left the world. I do hope she has not been so mad as to go into one of those cursed convents.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Vizard, I will now write to friends in all the Continental towns where there is good music. She will not be able to keep away from that long. I will also send photographs; and hope we may hear something. If not, perhaps a *judicious advertisement* might remind her that she is inflicting pain upon persons to whom she is dear. I am, sir, your obliged and grateful servant,\\n\\nJOSEPH ASHMEAD.\\\"\\n\\nHere was a blow. I really believe Vizard felt this more deeply than all his other disappointments.\\n\\nHe brooded over it for a day or two; and then, as he thought Miss Gale a very ill-used person, though not, of course, so ill-used as himself, he took her Ashmead's letter.\\n\\n\\\"This is nice!\\\" said she. \\\"There--I must give up loving women. Besides, they throw me over the moment a man comes, if it happens to be the right one.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Unnatural creatures!\\\" said Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"Ungrateful, at all events.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you think she has gone into a convent?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not she. In the first place, she is a Protestant; and, in the second, she is not a fool.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will advertise.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The idea!\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/48](ethereum://0xb932a70a57673d89f4acffbe830e8ed7f75fb9e0/48)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637672816,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Why, that was the very day I left England.\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"SMr0_m3K77z3hDbei3VqgOcmpowBHUzpSrrK2esbR3w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9dA14EBFe3CfE059a88A873b83F5D7f596175316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZxDJu8KNHaFcqOVtPyxrv6qFQQ6MXU8hi8CpS0pMukE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wGJLXGRnBwvHerU3Uf1ntXWWrqpbLJoO6PJjwQpz8zs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eP6dh1mVTZyYcPmDD-fKAKWEuRaeoUSyt3rDKjJLN1Z53UXTg5RHw_ng9FLTPkC2Hf2oNOs2tyuyo-8jmqt3ZA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0b9110694f9810c0eec15f385e1e4c62b04e6e89e7cf84882c908b89aeb305dc09726cd377bb18e1cfe95a03a361db9e65d2a2d4f7e99b5d49145fef3d2b98291c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZxDJu8KNHaFcqOVtPyxrv6qFQQ6MXU8hi8CpS0pMukE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wGJLXGRnBwvHerU3Uf1ntXWWrqpbLJoO6PJjwQpz8zs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SMr0_m3K77z3hDbei3VqgOcmpowBHUzpSrrK2esbR3w\"}"
