"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Time is like a never-ending River, quietly and quietly flowing by people. Unconsciously, we sent away the mighty golden tiger and ushered in the lovely jade rabbit. One year has passed, and we ushered in a new year.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe new house in my hometown has been built, so I spent the Spring Festival at my grandmother's house this year. I had no friends there. At night, no one played with me. I could only sit in front of the TV and watch TV. At this time, I couldn't help thinking of the scene at Grandma's house: grandma would be very busy on New Year's Eve. Spring Festival couplets are pasted at the door of each building; The smell of new year's Eve dinner wafts from every door and window; Friends dressed in new clothes chased and frolicked in the yard, and set off all kinds of fireworks and firecrackers together. Now, I don't know anyone here. Even if there is, no one comes out to play at night. The new house is very big, quiet, very lonely, not lively at all, and there are only sketches on TV to look better. Unconsciously, it's twelve o'clock. It's so boring. I'm going to go to bed after setting off firecrackers with my father. I went up to the roof of the building. Suddenly, firecrackers rang out in every house, and fireworks burst out everywhere. There are high-rise buildings around grandma's house, which block the fireworks and can't be seen at all. In the countryside, there are bungalows, only four or five floors high, and they are relatively open. I can see the fireworks very clearly. I've never seen such a beautiful scene. Where I stand has become a good place to watch fireworks. Who can say that this is not the grace of heaven and earth? Fireworks never stop blooming, this one finished, that one started again, that one finished and went to another, one after another. Fireworks are colorful and dazzling, and some spread out like flowers; Some explode like a ball; Others flew towards me like meteors, as if they were going to splash me. It took a long time for the fireworks to stop. I calculated that the \\\"flower\\\" bloomed for 40 minutes.\\n\\n \\n\\nIn the sound of firecrackers and fireworks to welcome the new year, I slowly fell asleep. Although I have no friends to play with today, it is the happiest New Year's Eve I have ever had! The golden tiger made us lively last year, and the jade rabbit will make us relaxed and happy this year. Here, I wish you a happy new year and an auspicious year of the rat!\",\"timestamp\":1639147661,\"title\":\"NEVER\"},\"digest\":\"rXD9H7nlM98YxLwEqfN55SePztfnGNic5NPZ0zjLsxw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4302f9D36C3CC798fFB0C035dB8f2D7BA95B7093\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dT1P0FKGzcbCr_8KKUJq0ruaEb31zMNmRwLD_d6z-is\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tGXiki0zyphouklM8HT741XcTi335bG49BmsPBr9t2Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xBMaTdRPgKt3T5joFIUVi_zTdk6RcEZFb9T-x9H5EKvZDT0Cms_XYno4pfKpyvP7l2l9xL2cZS2joUe0JQFBWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x64c481d65e95d3ee83ee2ff336ec44a1cff527f58e916df9b3f1d73173760e4d5731d503b84e6b30ef2c1329db7f7b3ac9d72ccd6e9f3fcc257e2bb30a11a8141b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dT1P0FKGzcbCr_8KKUJq0ruaEb31zMNmRwLD_d6z-is\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tGXiki0zyphouklM8HT741XcTi335bG49BmsPBr9t2Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rXD9H7nlM98YxLwEqfN55SePztfnGNic5NPZ0zjLsxw\"}"
