First of all, most of the defi projects at the current stage are token issuance for the purpose of “printing money”, and the “mining architecture” launched by the defi project, which does not propose new solutions in the distribution and governance of tokens and community governance, is often unsustainable.\\\\\\nCompared with participating in community governance, all participants have no connection and lack the motivation to jointly participate in platform governance. Most miners tend to participate in the early stage in order to obtain high token incentives, which seriously hinders the ecological development and makes the mobility of the platform unsustainable. At present, many technical teams are not satisfied with the cold decentralized architecture at the current stage. Currency trading needs to build a sustainable and automatic decentralized financial system — defi2.0.\\\\\\nAt the stage of defi2.0, decentralized finance is more inclined to link all community members who may provide liquidity, take liquidity incentive as the starting point, bind the incentive relationship of users in all future transactions, and strive to build a decentralized financial architecture with temperature, sustainability and interconnection, which is also the ice breaking journey of defi2.0, It is an unprecedented innovation in financial governance.\\\\\\nCompared with defi1.0, defi2.0 ecosystem should have the following advantages:\\\\\\n※ we advocate the close contact between users and are committed to breaking the cold trading mode of defi1.0. We hope users can establish close horizontal contact and form strong vertical links at the same time.\\\\\\n※ let the whole ecology erupt more vitality and driving force, so as to always keep sufficient participation enthusiasm of the mobile ore pool.\\\\\\n※ give the ecological governance and decision-making power to community members, and all decisions are made by all members. Community members do not simply rely on enthusiasm and interest to participate in community activities. All members are stakeholders and communities, so that all members have the source power to participate, so as to truly realize decentralized governance.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636629018,\"title\":\"DeFi2.0 VS DeFi1.0 - jasonliu - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"sqsJaNUJFA--lZ3_pqjgfQfCGQPedm_MqapDutjjwKM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5C2930356784C160A667C5673B2Ef1996B9d6957\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1OuFyGzoacKqXWOiPAR1G2GuZlCbzju7TpMf7yrYh8U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8JVjemMDyI4unANsms5jpAc-GZRlqzii5vJLOXFNju4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1hxyu17ocIAWieOuNR-3C95oWS_B7wxZRPt-va5zgZ-elqXE8OkeuHus5vcJKuinPveEuIGIZhJlsBMsM889wA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x950a5015c0a4fbaec73c9f360a5b387a5571e4eaf1a60441d7b2c928e66bed225185a5577d8491bc3622155854df50621ea67bceb887f5e64486905c8f00b0361b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1OuFyGzoacKqXWOiPAR1G2GuZlCbzju7TpMf7yrYh8U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8JVjemMDyI4unANsms5jpAc-GZRlqzii5vJLOXFNju4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"sqsJaNUJFA--lZ3_pqjgfQfCGQPedm_MqapDutjjwKM\"}"
