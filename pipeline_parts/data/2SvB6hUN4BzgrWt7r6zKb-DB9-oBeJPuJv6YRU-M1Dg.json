"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Computing comes in waves. Each new technological breakthrough is a combination of the personal, electrical, mechanical, physical & material. Human neurons fire so that silicon circuits can twitch to life. Our biological brains create technological tools. We augment ourselves with our devices.\\n\\n![Imagine what he imagined](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yayqsVjodeI9nNde_XAwk.jpeg?height=2834&width=4001&size=large)\\n\\nThe impact of these tools keeps expanding. These technological tools have always had political power:\\n\\n* [International Business Machines helped the Nazis](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2001/04/hitlers-willing-business-partners/303146/) keep record of who to incinerate and who to incarcerate.\\n* [Alan Turingâ€™s Machine completely annihilated the Nazis](https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/how-alan-turing-cracked-the-enigma-code) after they figured out how to decode their encrypted evil.\\n* [Steve Jobsâ€™ iPhone changed the migratory patterns of millions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257985122_Social_Media_Usage_Tahriib_Migration_and_Settlement_among_Somali_Refugees_in_France) after people around the world saw what they are missing.\\n* [Jack Dorseyâ€™s Twitter helped spark the uprising in the Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media_and_the_Arab_Spring) and the deposition of several despots.\\n* [Mark Zuckerbergâ€™s Facebook has led to the slaughter of vulnerable people](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/technology/myanmar-facebook-genocide.html) and the mental health crisis plaguing our planet.\\n* [Vitalik Buterinâ€™s Ethereum created a new supra-national digital jurisdiction](https://twitter.com/senwarren/status/1470843764843458560) that has aggravated the US & EU.\\n* [Sam Williamâ€™s Arweave upset the Chinese Communist Party](https://fortune.com/2020/11/05/chinese-spies-hack-anticensorship-startup/) after they finally realised they cannot censor it completely.\\n\\nThe scale of computing wavesâ€™ impact has expanded every decade. Decisions made in the algorithm departments of a few companies in California affect the mental health of the planet. International democracies are struggling to cope with the fact that they are subject to the whims of our digital demagogues.\\n\\nLet us look back on the waves we have seen in recent history:\\n\\n**100s**\\nmechanical\\nelectrical\\nmainframe\\n\\n**1,000,000s**\\nmini\\npersonal\\ndesktop\\n\\n**1,000,000,000s**\\ninternet\\ncloud\\nmobile\\n\\n**everyone**\\nsocial\\nartificial\\neconomic\\n\\nPhysical monarchies were challenged by the US Constitution.
