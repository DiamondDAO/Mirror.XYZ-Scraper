"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"but the clouds still hung about the mountains, and promised a speedy fall; I nevertheless resolved rather to submit myself to the fury of the elements than to remain longer in my present quarters, and so ordered the horses to be saddled.\\n\\nBefore my departure roast lamb and butter were offered me.  I thanked my entertainers; but refrained from tasting any thing, excusing myself on the plea of not feeling hungry, which was in reality the case; for if I only looked at the dirty people who surrounded me, my appetite vanished instantly.  So long as my stock of bread and cheese lasted, I kept to it, and ate nothing else.\\n\\nTaking leave of my good hosts, we continued our journey to Reikjavik, by the same road on which I had travelled on my journey hither.  This had not been my original plan on starting from Reikjavik; I had intended to proceed from Thingvalla directly to the Geyser, to Hecla, &c.; but the horses were already exhausted, and the weather so dreadfully bad, without prospect of speedy amendment, that I preferred returning to Reikjavik, and waiting for better times in my pleasant little room at the house of the good baker.\\n\\nWe rode on as well as we could amidst ceaseless storms of wind and rain.  The most disagreeable circumstance of all was our being obliged to spend the hours devoted to rest in the open air, under a by no means cloudless sky, as during our whole day's journey we saw not a single hut, save the solitary one in the lava desert, which serves as a resting-place for travellers during the winter.  So we continued our journey until we reached a scanty meadow.  Here I had my choice either to walk about for two hours, or to sit down upon the wet grass.  I could find nothing better to do than to turn my back upon the wind and rain, to remain standing on one spot, to have patience, and for amusement to observe the direction in which the clouds scudded by.  At the same time I discussed my frugal meal, more for want of something to do than from hunger; if I felt thirsty, I had only to turn round and open my mouth.\\n\\nIf there are natures peculiarly fitted for travelling, I am fortunate in being blessed with such an one.  No rain or wind was powerful enough to give me even a cold.  During this whole excursion I had tasted no warm or nourishing food; I had slept every night upon a bench or a chest; had ridden nearly 255 miles in six days; and had besides scrambled about bravely in the cavern of Surthellir; and, in spite of all this privation and fatigue, I arrived at Reikjavik in good health and spirits.\\n\\nShort summary of this journey:\\n\\n```\\n                                           Miles First day, from Reikjavik to Thingvalla         46 Second day, from Thingvalla to Reikholt         51 Third day, from Reikholt to the different springs, and back again                         19 Fourth day, from Reikholt to Surthellir, and back to Kalmannstunga                           40 Fifth day, from Kalmannstunga to Thingvalla     51 Sixth day, from Thingvalla to Reikjavik         46 Total                                          253\\n```\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nThe weather soon cleared up, and I continued my journey to the Geyser and to Mount Hecla on the 24th June.  On the first day, when we rode to Thingvalla, we passed no new scenery, but saw instead an extremely beautiful atmospheric phenomenon.\\n\\nAs we approached the lake, some thin mist-clouds lowered over it and over the earth, so that it seemed as if it would rain.  One portion of the firmament glowed with the brightest blue; while the other part was obscured by thick clouds, through which the sun was just breaking.  Some of its rays reached the clouds of mist, and illuminated them in a wonderfully beautiful manner.  The most delicate shades of colour seemed breathed, as it were, over them like a dissolving rainbow, whose glowing colours were intermingled and yet singly perceptible.  This play of colours continued for half an hour, then faded gradually till it vanished entirely, and the ordinary atmosphere took its place.  It was one of the most beautiful appearances I had ever witnessed.\\n\\nJune 25th.\\n\\nThe roads separate about a mile behind the little town of Thingvalla; the one to the left goes to Reikholt, the right-hand one leads to the Geyser.  We rode for some time along the shores of the lake, and found at the end of the valley an awful chasm in the rock, similar to the one of Almanagiau, which we had passed on such a wretched road.\\n\\nThe contiguous valley bore a great resemblance to that of Thingvalla; but the third one was again fearful.  Lava covered it, and was quite overgrown with that whitish moss, which has a beautiful appearance when it only covers a portion of the lava, and when black masses rise above it, but which here presented a most monotonous aspect.\\n\\nWe also passed two grottoes which opened at our feet.  At the entrance of one stood a pillar of rock supporting an immense slab of lava, which formed an awe-inspiring portal.  I had unfortunately not known of the existence of these caves, and was consequently unprepared to visit them.  Torches, at least, would have been requisite.  But I subsequently heard that they were not at all deep, and contained nothing of interest.\\n\\nIn the course of the day we passed through valleys such as I had seen nowhere else in Iceland.  Beautiful meadow-lawns, perfectly level, covered the country for miles.  These rich valleys were, of course, tolerably well populated; we frequently passed three or four contiguous cottages, and saw horses, cows, and sheep grazing on these fields in considerable numbers.\\n\\nThe mountains which bounded these valleys on the left seemed to me very remarkable; they were partly brown, black, or dark blue, like the others; but the bulk of which they were composed I considered to be fine loam-soil layers, if I may trust my imperfect mineralogical knowledge.  Some of these mountains were topped by large isolated lava rocks, real giants; and it seemed inexplicable to me how they could stand on the soft soil beneath.\\n\\nIn one of these valleys we passed a considerable lake, on and around which rose circling clouds of steam proceeding from hot springs, but of no great size.  But after we had already travelled about twenty- five miles, we came to the most remarkable object I had ever met with; this was a river with a most peculiar bed.\\n\\nThis river-bed is broad and somewhat steep; it consists of lava strata, and is divided lengthwise in the middle by a cleft eighteen to twenty feet deep, and fifteen to eighteen feet broad, towards which the bubbling and surging waters rush, so that the sound is heard at some distance.  A little wooden bridge, which stands in the middle of the stream, and over which the high waves constantly play, leads over the chasm.  Any one not aware of the fact can hardly explain this appearance to himself, nor understand the noise and surging of the stream.  The little bridge in the centre would be taken for the ruins of a fallen bridge, and the chasm is not seen from the shore, because the foaming waves overtop it.  An indescribable fear would seize upon the traveller when he beheld the venturous guide ride into the stream, and was obliged to follow without pity or mercy.\\n\\nThe priest of Thingvalla had prepared me for the scene, and had advised me to WALK over the bridge; but as the water at this season stood so high that the waves from both sides dashed two feet above the bridge, I could not descend from my horse, and was obliged to ride across.\\n\\nThe whole passage through the stream is so peculiar, that it must be seen, and can scarcely be described.  The water gushes and plays on all sides with fearful force; it rushes into the chasm with impetuous violence, forms waterfalls on both sides, and breaks itself on the projecting rocks.  Not far from the bridge the cleft terminates; and the whole breadth of the waters falls over rocks thirty to forty feet high.  The nearer we approached the centre, the deeper, more violent, and impetuous grew the stream, and the more deafening was the noise.  The horses became restless and shy; and when we came to the bridge, they began to tremble, they reared, they turned to all sides but the right one, and refused to obey the bridle.  With infinite trouble we at last succeeded in bringing them across this dangerous place.\\n\\nThe valley which is traversed by this peculiar river is narrow, and quite enclosed by lava mountains and hills; the inanimate, silent nature around is perfectly adapted to imprint this scene for ever on the traveller's memory.\\n\\nThis remarkable stream had been the last difficulty; and now we proceeded quietly and safely through the beautiful valleys till we approached the Geyser, which a projecting hillock enviously concealed from my anxiously curious gaze.  At last this hillock was passed; and I saw the Geyser with its surrounding scenery, with its immense steam pillars, and the clouds and cloudlets rising from it. The hill was about two miles distant from the Geyser and the other hot springs.  There they were, boiling and bubbling all around, and through the midst lay the road to the basin.  Eighty paces from it we halted.\\n\\nAnd now I stood before the chief object of my journey; I saw it, it was so near me, and yet I did not venture to approach it.  But a peasant who had followed us from one of the neighbouring cottages, and had probably guessed my anxiety and my fear, took me by the hand and constituted himself my cicerone.  He had unfortunately, it being Sunday, paid too great a devotion to the brandy-bottle, so that he staggered rather than walked, and I hesitated to trust myself to the guidance of this man, not knowing whether he had reason enough left to distinguish how far we might with safety venture.  My guide, who had accompanied me from Reikjavik, assured me indeed that I might trust him in spite of his intoxication, and that he would himself go with us to translate the peasant's Icelandic jargon into Danish; but nevertheless I followed with great trepidation.\\n\\nHe led me to the margin of the basin of the great Geyser, which lies on the top of a gentle elevation of about ten feet, and contains the outer and the inner basins.  The diameter of the outer basin may be about thirty feet; that of the inner one six to seven feet.  Both were filled to the brim, the water was pure as crystal, but boiled and bubbled only slightly.  We soon left this spot; for when the basins are quite filled with water it is very dangerous to approach them, as they may empty themselves any moment by an eruption.  We therefore went to inspect the other springs.\\n\\nMy unsteady guide pointed those out which we might unhesitatingly approach, and warned me from the others.  Then we returned to the great Geyser, where he gave me some precautionary rules, in case of an intervening eruption, and then left me to prepare some accommodation for my stay.  I will briefly enumerate the rules he gave me.\\n\\n\\\"The pillar of water always rises perpendicularly, and the overflowing water has its chief outlets on one and the same side. The water does indeed escape on the other side, but only in inconsiderable quantities, and in shapeless little ducts, which one may easily evade.  On this side one may therefore approach within forty paces even during the most violent eruptions.  The eruption announces itself by a dull roaring; and as soon as this is heard, the traveller must hastily retire to the above-named distance, as the eruption always follows very quickly after the noise.  The water, however, does not rise high every time, often only very inconsiderably, so that, to see a very fine explosion, it is often necessary to stay some days here.\\\"\\n\\nThe French scholar, M. P. Geimard, has provided for the accommodation of travellers with a truly noble disinterestedness. He traversed the whole of Iceland some years ago and left two large tents behind him; one here, and the other in Thingvalla.  The one here is particularly appropriate, as travellers are frequently obliged, as stated above, to wait several days for a fine eruption. Every traveller certainly owes M. Geimard the warmest thanks for this convenience.  A peasant, the same who guides travellers to the springs, has the charge of it, and is bound to pitch it for any one for a fee of one or two florins.\\n\\nWhen my tent was ready it was nearly eleven o'clock.  My companions retired, and I remained alone.\\n\\nIt is usual to watch through the night in order not to miss an eruption.  Now, although an alternate watching is no very arduous matter for several travellers, it became a very hard task for me alone, and an Icelandic peasant cannot be trusted; an eruption of Mount Hecla would scarcely arouse him.\\n\\nI sat sometimes before and sometimes in my tent, and listened with anxious expectation for the coming events; at last, after midnight-- the witching hour--I heard some hollow sounds, as if a cannon were being fired at a great distance, and its echoing sounds were borne by the breeze.  I rushed from my tent and expected subterranean noises, violent cracking and trembling of the earth, according to the descriptions I had read.  I could scarcely repress a slight sensation of fear.  To be alone at midnight in such a scene is certainly no joke.\\n\\nMany of my friends may remember my telling them, before my departure, that I expected I should need the most courage on my Icelandic journey during the nights at the Geyser.\\n\\nThese hollow sounds were repeated, at very short intervals, thirteen times; and each time the basin overflowed and ejected a considerable quantity of water.  The sounds did not seem to proceed from subterranean ragings, but from the violent agitation of the waters. In a minute and a half all was over; the water no longer overflowed, the caldron and basin remained filled, and I returned to my tent disappointed in every way.  This phenomenon was repeated every two hours and a half, or, at the latest, every three hours and a half. I saw and heard nothing else all night, the next day, or the second night.  I waited in vain for an eruption.\\n\\nWhen I had accustomed myself to these temporary effusions of my neighbour, I either indulged in a gentle slumber in the intermediate time, or I visited the other springs and explored.  I wished to discover the boiling vapour and the coloured springs which many travellers assert they have seen here.\\n\\nAll the hot-springs are united with a circumference of 800 to 900 paces:  several of them are very remarkable, but the majority insignificant.\\n\\nThey are situated in the angle of an immense valley at the foot of a hill, behind which extends a chain of mountains.  The valley is entirely covered with grass, and the vegetation only decreases a little in the immediate vicinity of the springs.  Cottages are built every where in the neighbourhood; the nearest to the springs are only about 700 to 800 paces distant.\\n\\nI counted twelve large basins with boiling and gushing springs; of smaller ones there were many more.\\n\\nAmong the gushing springs the Strokker is the most remarkable.  It boils and bubbles with most extraordinary violence at a depth of about twenty feet, shoots up suddenly, and projects its waters into the air.  Its eruptions sometimes last half an hour, and the column occasionally ascends to a height of forty feet.  I witnessed several of its eruptions; but unfortunately not one of the largest.  The highest I saw could not have been above thirty feet, and did not last more than a quarter of an hour.  The Strokker is the only spring, except the Geyser, which has to be approached with great caution.  The eruptions sometimes succeed each other quickly, and sometimes cease for a few hours, and are not preceded by any sign. Another spring spouts constantly, but never higher than three to four feet.  A third one lies about four or five feet deep, in a rather broad basin, and produces only a few little bubbles.  But this calmness is deceptive:  it seldom lasts more than half a minute, rarely two or three minutes; then the spring begins to bubble, to boil, and to wave and spout to a height of two or three feet; without, however, reaching the level of the basin.  In some springs I heard boiling and foaming like a gentle bellowing; but saw no water, sometimes not even steam, rising.\\n\\nTwo of the most remarkable springs which can perhaps be found in the world are situated immediately above the Geyser, in two openings, which are separated by a wall of rock scarcely a foot wide.  This partition does not rise above the surface of the soil, but descends into the earth; the water boils slowly, and has an equable, moderate discharge.  The beauty of these springs consists in their remarkable transparency.  All the varied forms and caves, the projecting peaks, and edges of rock, are visible far down, until the eye is lost in the depths of darkness.  But the greatest beauty of the spring is the splendid colouring proceeding from the rock; it is of the tenderest, most transparent, pale blue and green, and resembles the reflection of a Bengal flame.  But what is most strange is, that this play of colour proceeds from the rock, and only extends eight to ten inches from it, while the other water is colourless as common water, only more transparent, and purer.\\n\\nI could not believe it at first, and thought it must be occasioned by the sun; I therefore visited the springs at different times, sometimes when the sun shone brightly, sometimes when it was obscured by clouds, once even after its setting; but the colouring always remained the same.\\n\\nOne may fearlessly approach the brink of these springs.  The platform which projects directly from them, and under which one can see in all directions, is indeed only a thin ledge of rock, but strong enough to prevent any accident.  The beauty consists, as I have said, in the magical illumination, and in the transparency, by which all the caves and grottoes to the greatest depths become visible to the eye.  Involuntarily I thought of Schiller's Diver. {40}  I seemed to see the goblet hang on the peaks and jags of the rock; I could fancy I saw the monsters rise from the bottom.  It must be a peculiar pleasure to read this splendid poem in such an appropriate spot.\\n\\nI found scarcely any basins of Brodem or coloured waters.  The only one of the kind which I saw was a small basin, in which a brownish- red substance, rather denser than water, was boiling.  Another smaller spring, with dirty brown water, I should have quite overlooked, if I had not so industriously searched for these curiosities.\\n\\nAt last, after long waiting, on the second day of my stay, on the 27th June, at half-past eight in the morning, I was destined to see an eruption of the Geyser in its greatest perfection.  The peasant, who came daily in the morning and in the evening to inquire whether I had already seen an eruption, was with me when the hollow sounds which precede it were again heard.  We hastened out, and I again despaired of seeing any thing; the water only overflowed as usual, and the sound was already ceasing.  But all at once, when the last sounds had scarcely died away, the explosion began.  Words fail me when I try to describe it:  such a magnificent and overpowering sight can only be seen once in a lifetime.\\n\\nAll my expectations and suppositions were far surpassed.  The water spouted upwards with indescribable force and bulk; one pillar rose higher than the other; each seemed to emulate the other.  When I had in some measure recovered from the surprise, and regained composure, I looked at the tent.  How little, how dwarfish it seemed as compared to the height of these pillars of water!  And yet it was about twenty feet high.  It did, indeed, lie ten feet lower than the basin of the Geyser; but if tent had been raised above tent, these ten feet could only be deducted once, and I calculated, though my calculation may not be correct, that one would need to pile up five or six tents to have the height of one of the pillars.  Without exaggeration, I think the largest spout rose above one hundred feet high, and was three to four feet in diameter.\\n\\nFortunately I had looked at my watch at the beginning of the hollow sounds, the forerunners of the eruption, for during its continuance I should probably have forgotten to do so.  The whole lasted four minutes, of which the greater half must have been taken up by the eruption itself.\\n\\nWhen this wonderful scene was over, the peasant accompanied me to the basin.  We could now approach it and the boiler without danger, and examine both at leisure.  There was now nothing to fear; the water had entirely disappeared from the outer basin.  We entered it and approached the inner basin, in which the water had sunk seven or eight feet, where it boiled and bubbled fiercely.\\n\\nWith a hammer I broke some crust out of the outer as well as out of the inner basin; the former was white, the latter brown.  I also tasted the water; it had not an unpleasant taste, and can only contain an inconsiderable proportion of sulphur, as the steam does not even smell of it.\\n\\nI went to the basin of the Geyser every half hour to observe how much time was required to fill it again.  After an hour I could still descend into the outer basin; but half an hour later the inner basin was already full, and commenced to overflow.  As long as the water only filled the inner basin it boiled violently; but the higher it rose in the outer one, the less it boiled, and nearly ceased when the basin was filled:  it only threw little bubbles here and there.\\n\\nAfter a lapse of two hours--it was just noon--the basin was filled nearly to the brim; and while I stood beside it the water began again to bubble violently, and to emit the hollow sounds.  I had scarcely time to retreat, for the pillars of water rose immediately. This time they spouted during the noise, and were more bulky than those of the first explosion, which might proceed from their not rising so high, and therefore remaining more compact.  Their height may have been from forty to fifty feet.  The basins this time remained nearly as full after the eruption as before.\\n\\nI had now seen two eruptions of the Geyser, and felt amply compensated for my persevering patience and watchfulness.  But I was destined to be more fortunate, and to experience its explosions in all their variety.  The spring spouted again at seven o'clock in the evening, ascended higher than at noon, and brought up some stones, which looked like black spots and points in the white frothy water- column.  And during the third night it presented itself under another phase:  the water rose in dreadful, quickly-succeeding waves, without throwing rays; the basin overflowed violently, and generated such a mass of steam as is rarely seen.  The wind accidentally blew it to the spot where I stood, and it enveloped me so closely that I could scarcely see a few feet off.  But I perceived neither smell nor oppression, merely a slight degree of warmth.\\n\\nJune 28th.\",\"timestamp\":1637496314,\"title\":\"\\nAt length the morning so long sighed for came; the rain had indeed ceased\"},\"digest\":\"jEn2uGnFbPMlqSbM-vIRE58LgxjGML1xqeUefoMASRg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9DC92730677fd3244eD267F4e8bDd94201A144f8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jlUd3uRx_l0Q-gjRY9uSL2xzcm0lYdR4no25XP5nkhk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FJn_wp1wpphOQJx6wfFGdkE_mhJYnn903Gv69BSne24\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hdRNV1ceLIptcAj3SiYDq7KtW9q-Zhel6ChQVIQzUct5q15P2gWqZK8Gs5xzK8fd0saGG_q9lYIGFBTei5PujQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x033917105ec111a6e919637d9715b8f1b7874220fd5aa49a43b210e5702335df4895ac326dfd7c7c5aad480e6d59264edd6401b10301f9ecbb4a6aef621f57881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jlUd3uRx_l0Q-gjRY9uSL2xzcm0lYdR4no25XP5nkhk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FJn_wp1wpphOQJx6wfFGdkE_mhJYnn903Gv69BSne24\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jEn2uGnFbPMlqSbM-vIRE58LgxjGML1xqeUefoMASRg\"}"
