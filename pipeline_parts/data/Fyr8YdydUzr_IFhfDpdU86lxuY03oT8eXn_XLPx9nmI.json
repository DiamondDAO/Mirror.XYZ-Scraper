"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Since Polkadot’s Relay Chain does not have smart contracts, it’s up to the blockchains plugged into Polkadot to enable smart contracts. For example, one parachain called Moonbeam has full compatibility with Ethereum contracts. Moonbeam’s developers have created a way to interact with digital currencies built on Polkadot via MetaMask, the popular web browser wallet for decentralized finance. This means that tokens built on Polkadot’s Substrate, which is a blockchain development tool, can be seamlessly sent to Ethereum wallets and smart contract addresses.\\n\\nThe next layer of the Polkadot ecosystem includes projects building on top of the blockchains that are built on top of the Relay Chain. For example, Ocean Protocol is in the process of deploying its smart contracts onto the Moonbeam blockchain. By building on top of Moonbeam, the OCEAN token will be compatible with both Polkadot and Ethereum blockchain applications.\\n\\n### Rebuilding Ethereum’s network on Polkadot\\n\\nThe improved scalability of Polkadot enables many projects to overcome Etheruem’s high transaction fees and the low number of transactions per second. Similar to Ethereum’s decentralized data storage projects such as Filecoin, Sia or Storj, Crust Network is building a similar solution on top of Polkadot. Unlike Ethereum-based projects, Crust Network isn’t constrained by Ethereum’s scalability problems. Many of the applications we have come to love on Ethereum are being rebuilt on the Polkadot network or integrated via chain-agnostic gateways.\\n\\nThe Polkadot ecosystem is brimming with projects ranging from decentralized cloud computing with Phala Network to cross-chain custodial wallets such as the browser-based MathWallet. The hardware-based virtual private network project Deeper Network has already sold over 10,000 physical devices on Indiegogo, Amazon and BestBuy. Deeper’s blockchain solution coordinates all devices and routing in a privacy-preserving way, holds the device registry (in the form of public-key infrastructure), and manages staking and reputation subsystems.\",\"timestamp\":1639120761,\"title\":\"No smart contracts on Polkadot\"},\"digest\":\"kJZvc4iRv6qHPqJh_EIQiPVxLm07YtNdznfUpkUC53Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC57349670Ea8Eb6677e8e575fA989B353fAa5b61\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rc5727tFkmmkgGZAhAQ0ToSQ5jDeIGMU0Recj2A2P0U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AvZkL1txwrnf0pehe-LJL7YevqywKOV-qPP-Ds6YWXY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NsrJO4eZViAVYBtqwn236FVS2dD0UFyBKu78NHfrVY4MSp9ue-jRS3sZgrTqYtA_TfvqJAIoBxw_Vqc1HucixQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x619f3a68538a986e50ef87f9c1b22a3ff78b5839e19a387eb1b9105d935f3d8c718b39edca1fdda2e31c5ebee41b8e828dad75f36d3980ab1c348357f19315ca1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rc5727tFkmmkgGZAhAQ0ToSQ5jDeIGMU0Recj2A2P0U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AvZkL1txwrnf0pehe-LJL7YevqywKOV-qPP-Ds6YWXY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kJZvc4iRv6qHPqJh_EIQiPVxLm07YtNdznfUpkUC53Y\"}"
