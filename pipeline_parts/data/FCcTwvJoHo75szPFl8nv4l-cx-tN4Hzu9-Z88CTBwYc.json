They transcend platforms, geographic locations, and language. NFTs are slowly becoming the economic infrastructure behind the internet's content and creators. Recent demand for meme NFTs has proven memes are more valuable when minted as NFTs. Here we explore minting memes as NFTs, arguing that soon most memes will be minted as NFTs due to advantages in monetization, provenance, attribution, and platform-agnosticism. \\n\\nWe define *meme* in this piece not by its broad definition as \\\"a passing element of a culture or system of behavior\\\" but by its media-focused definition of \\\"a humorous image, video, piece of text, etc., that is copied (often with slight variations) and spread rapidly by internet users.\\\" This makes the argument easier to comprehend, though many of the fundamentals argued in this piece may apply to memes more broadly.\\n\\n## First Classic Memes, then Fresh Memes\\n\\nMost memes that have recently auctioned as NFTs have been mostly pre-existing memes, meaning they were initially created off-chain and have been circulating the internet pre-minting. Some examples of pre-existing memes minted as NFTs are Doge, Nyan Cat, Disaster Girl, Bad Luck Brian, and more by the day. \\n\\n[Memes turned NFTs | Yupcollections](https://app.yup.io/collections/memes-turned-nfts/CguHLel)\\n\\nThe minting of classic memes as NFTs serves as a precursor for genuine 'fresh memes' that originate as NFTs. As sales for meme NFTs exploded, meme lords and comedians have begun creating memes directly as NFTs on NFT platforms. See below a hilarious meme by comedian/artist SlyFly. \\n\\n[NFT Not Dead | Foundation](https://foundation.app/@slyflynft/nft-not-dead-45350)\\n\\nAll memes should be minted as NFTs whether or not people are planning to sell them, profit from them, or believe their price will increase over time. This will enable the birth of the Meme Economy. \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1370373708506750977?s=20)\\n\\n### Provenance - \\\"Proof-of-First\\\"\\n\\nNFTs are platform-agnostic, which means they can exist in various platforms while retaining uniqueness and authenticity. For example, as the graphic highlights below, the Nyan Cat NFT is showcased and displayed on various marketplaces and platforms. The famous meme GIF is linked to the address of the NFT so when someone shares the original NFT in their article, they can pull the on-chain address. This is powerful for memes because it allows them to maintain attribution and context in every platform. So any action on a meme NFT is accessible, readable, and usable in almost all platforms. Every bid, swap, and transaction is added to the metadata of that specific NFT.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/951f5a64-ff12-4881-a4fb-d6504f4995fe.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\\n\\nAs Web3 social continues to evolve, the engagement data associated with an NFT also becomes platform agnostic. With [Yup](http://yup.io), for example, the likes and comments given across the web are tied directly to an NFT. This is quite different than web2 social. For example, if a meme is shared on both FB and Twitter, there's no relationship between those two memes so hard to attribute the relationship between the two. Platforms can be scraped and AI can identify memes, but the data gathered on each platform is siloed.\\n\\n**Why would someone attribute correctly?** \\n\\n1. Platform restrictions\\n    1. can be done in centralized way or decentralized. \\n2. For exposure\\n3. Composability\\n4. Social norms\\n\\nThe platform-agnostic features of NFTs, the immutability of the blockchain, and decentralized governance make for a perfect recipe of provenance and economic incentives.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1378955787171602432?s=20)\\n\\n### Layered Splits\\n\\nSplits were pioneered by Mirror, but more recently we've witnessed Foundation use them for NFTs. Turn their memes to NFTs when they're using someone else's memes as a template. Ex: Doge meme, photo of the dog, if you use that, you make it like your original meme even though someone else is using it.\\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ea0cf67d-819e-4a83-aac5-205b72a044a2.jpeg?height=838&width=1630)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac729cb6-15f4-4584-a75b-7df5fd6ad063.jpeg?height=838&width=1252)\\n\\n\\n\\nA great example is async.art - an NFT platform for programable media, using layers as assets, allowing users to use them in powerful ways. When the market is high or low, people create angry memes or happy memes. Cool stuff like that. Situations like that can expand to memes very quickly.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/99695862-cf4f-4bc1-bad5-315f0ea15377.jpeg?height=768&width=1024)\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now, some may argue that it is ridiculous that every meme is a NFT for the following reasons. Users will mint images that they don't own -- there are no rights and copyright for commercial use but they are getting rewarded for it. Others may suggest that people won't mint memes of NFTs because it is expensive. But seeing improvements in layer 1 and layer 2, it's becoming cheaper and cheaper to mint any graphics as an NFT\\n\\nWhat we expect to see next is price of NFTs will drop to a cent or less than a cent. Once it's cheap enough to casually mint NFTs, people will. This gives meme NFTs an additional utility as building blocks for other NFTs. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nTo conclude, as it becomes easier and cheaper to mint NFTs, users can retain ownership and buyers can speculate and commemorate the NFTs moving forward.\\n\\nAllow multilayered memes so that users can use existing memes or own memes while maintain attributions and royalties. Once we have that infrastructure in place, one can make a meme from other memes and the metadata becomes platform agnostic. The economics play out in such a manner that users are incentivized for using their own memes. Incentivize the norms and using the memes the that they use which will make people use more memes. To be able to build more value around in meme creation in a very clean and transparent marketplace. Incentivize creators to make more memes. \\n\\nLastly, this will also incentivize creators to curate valuable memes in the context of their own platforms and across the web in order to participate in the reward association. Ultimately, it is a win win, for curators, platforms and fans that allow memes to evolve to a fully functioning economy.\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1625684494,\"title\":\"NFTs & the Meme Economy\",\"publication\":\"yup\"},\"digest\":\"xPJmhRB0dHBw3ulcQMl3HhPi99oFwH1lgMaSktW4WCk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4303Ddc9943D862f2B205aF468a4A786c5137E76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2aa0N8coUrvDdiq6N7PDThcTBnMPXu3iZYwG_0_Y0Io\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9-XQ2B-q4vpOoRckvIknADKcHNZmBea8x7ETv_fA_NY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jfoqtQ-NzPL9UyBlvJlwzvfVDvyy_Dja516Q5iVsvgEN5BsFfyxdtZLkoRIaXaK_M2tMpenQTfUsKue2X4cWYw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x74a7191ce3686f2a01ecc9317220793a6e53a37a2537f106ee499fd4d3f82bf0438b113606ff47a426c3a987cc6e625eb1596e0c2f09d9a8c341e71a37e57da71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on ff.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2aa0N8coUrvDdiq6N7PDThcTBnMPXu3iZYwG_0_Y0Io\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9-XQ2B-q4vpOoRckvIknADKcHNZmBea8x7ETv_fA_NY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bDMST-9H2_2pXLHkO8b_1mCargJk56BGGFXEKBQtL8I\"}"
