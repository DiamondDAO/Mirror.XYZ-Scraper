"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**In a [previous post](https://mirror.xyz/shamusnoonan.eth/EPhsM7rsMS5zdHp3YtlCdDPERxBT6Qr5bjNCWYftNAQ), I wrote about how Centralized Exchanges (CEX’s) handle over 98% of all crypto transactions due to their user-friendly platforms. However, the rise of peer-to-peer trading has risen over 10,000% in the past 12 months due to new advancements in Decentralized Exchanges.**\\n\\nIn this guide, I’ll explain what Decentralized Exchanges are and how they work, helpful tips to know before using them, and why it’s critical to unlocking new value in the Defi ecosystem.\\n\\n![Photo credit: Yield.app](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ANggj_lnzBEcGo_7pfCZb.png?height=1096&width=1944)\\n\\n## What is a DEX and how does it work?\\n\\nA decentralized exchange, or DEX, is a peer-to-peer trading exchange which allows users to conduct transactions directly, without having the need for an intermediary.\\n\\n*In the simplest of analogies:* it’s a neutral marketplace that helps match buyers and sellers, without any type of authority overseeing and monitoring those transactions. It’s like going to a farmers market. You (the buyer) can purchase a dozen eggs directly from a farmer (seller), instead of going to Safeway where they control the inventory and you’re subject to additional fees and markups, since they went out and sourced and packaged those eggs and put them in their aisle.\\n\\nUnlike a Centralized Exchange (CEX) that is controlled by an organization, DEX’s are governed by [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) built on top of the blockchain. A DEX is to be able to automate all of the traditional intermediary services like matching a buyer and selling (matching orders typically done by stockbrokers, government institutions and banks)  and instead, automate these responsibilities into smart contracts, which will autonomously execute an agreement between a buyer and seller based on a set of rules (if X happens, Y pays Z a predetermined amount). Users who use DEX’s custody (i.e. take ownership of their own funds) and are responsible for knowing how these smart contracts work and where they can find their funds after they make a trade. Every trade is recorded on the blockchain so you can always see your transaction history.\\n\\n## The 3 types of DEX’s:\\n\\n![Source: Cointelegraph.com](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_RWilcidQhA89GyULjGtT.png?height=628&width=1342)\\n\\n**Automated Market Makers (AMM’s):** AMM’s use pre-funded pools (known as liquidity pools) to execute trades. They incentivize users to deposit their funds into pre-defined pairs (ETH/LINK pair, meaning equal parts ETH and LINK) to allow other users to fulfill orders. It breaks the CEX model for order books and creates a new way to facilitate trades. [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) was one of the first pioneers of the AMM model and grew 40x from January 2020 to January 2021.\\n\\n**Order book:** this is similar to a Centralized Exchange like Coinbase or Binance. Order books compile records of open orders to buy and sell crypto assets based on pairs (i.e. ETH / LINK pair). There’s on-chain (meaning, on the block*chain*) AND off-chain order books. DEX’s may use either method or a combination. Most DEX’s will operate their order books off-chain (cheaper and faster) and orders are settled on-chain. [Polkadex](https://www.polkadex.trade/) is an example of a DEX that runs an order book, which is built on Substrate, a framework built on top of the Polkadot blockchain.\\n\\n**DEX aggregator:** the “Kayak.com” for finding the best trades across multiple DEX’s. [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/) (which comes from the equation dy/dx, which is a math notation for a derivative) is one of the most popular aggregators, which was founded by an ex-Coinbase employee and surpassed Coinbase in volume in October of 2021 after China banned the use of CEX’s and users flocked to decentralized platforms to execute trades.\\n\\nWhile these 3 models slightly differ, every DEX’s goal is the same: to have an abundance of liquidity to allow users to execute trades as quickly and efficiently as possible. DEX’s will create different strategies to try bootstrap liquidity onto their platform by offering high APY’s (with some protocols offering 10,000% APY’s for you to deposit funds into their platform) or other economic incentives. Just like the hummus stand at the farmers market that gives away free samples every week - they hope you like the product and convert into a paying customer and come back and buy more next week! If you don’t end up purchasing it, at some point, they will start losing money on the free samples. This is the same strategy most DEX’s deploy. They will offer high interest for early adopters to come onto their platform and deposit their funds with the hopes that they will like the platform and convert into long term customers.\\n\\nThere’s a lot more complexity to it, but in the end, it’s a matter of coming up with a strategy that attracts new users and beefing up the liquidity staked, or [total locked value](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/total-value-locked-tvl), in their platform. DEX’s take a small fee for every trade, so the more revenue they generate off trades, the more services they can offer (i.e. loans, leveraged trading and derivative trading), so long as they can fulfill the liquidity needed to execute these contracts. The end goal is that at some point, these DEX’s will hit a network effect that will sustain long term user growth, and they won’t need to subsidize with insanely high APY’s that are not sustainable for a long period of time.\\n\\n## Top 10 DEX’s (based on volume & market share)\\n\\n![Source: CoinMarketCap, screenshot taken on 12/7/21](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WQEeTD46wcT34px8MZ9uF.png?height=1164&width=1864)\\n\\nYou’ll notice that the top 10 DEX’s are relatively new (with Uniswap V2 being the ‘oldest’ in the list after launching in November of 2018) but growing quickly. The top 10 DEX’s recorded over $7B (USD) worth of volume *in the last 24 hours.*\\n\\n## How to use a DEX\\n\\nUnlike CEX’s, there’s no signup process that requires you to create an email or password. All you need is a wallet that’s compatible with the network you’re interacting with (check out my Beginners Guide to Yield Farming for a deeper dive on how to set up a wallet and trade) and you can begin using it right away.\\n\\n*A few things to be aware of before trading:*\\n\\n**Gas fees:** while you may be paying a lower fee than using a CEX, you are subject to gas fees on the network you’re transacting on. For example, if you wanted to swap $50 worth of ETH for LINK on the Ethereum Network, you may have to pay *double* that in gas fees (no, that’s not a joke!).\\n\\n**Slippage:** this happens when traders have to settle for a different price than what they initially requested. Most traders set a limit (you can do this in your settings), and you may have to adjust this to execute the trade depending on liquidity of the pair you’re looking to swap for.\\n\\n**Withdrawal and fees:** most DEX’s allow you to add or remove liquidity whenever you’d like, but some do have fees associated with withdrawing before a certain date. Read the fine print before depositing!\\n\\n## Advantages of a DEX\\n\\n**Privacy:** when using a DEX, you only need to use a wallet to login and begin trading. DEX’s will not track any of your personal information since they are not subject to KYC (know your customer) that CEX’s are subject to.\\n\\n**Token availability:** since DEX’s are not subject to local laws, they are able to list new tokens easier and faster. If there’s a project or protocol you believe in and want to invest in, you have the ability to do so without having to be subject to coins listed on a CEX.\\n\\n**No intermediary:** smart contracts automate most of the ‘middle man’ responsibilities most traditional institutions have, cutting out unnecessary fees and allowing you to execute trades faster and with lower fees. Smart contracts also minimize counterparty risks, since there are no humans involved and less chances of a delay in settlement since there’s no room for error (with the exception of a breach in the smart contract).\\n\\n## Risks:\\n\\n**Regulation:** generally speaking, crypto exchanges are required to register as a national securities exchange in the SEC. However, since DEX’s have no possession of order books (remember, they are just a marketplace and it’s peer-to-peer exchanging), they are in the grey zone for this and may be subject to laws and regulations in the future, but not at the moment.\\n\\n**Knowledge barrier:** most DEX’s are non-custodial, meaning they don’t store your keys and you're responsible for setting up your own wallet and funds. Unlike CEX’s that have an easy to use UI and platform that does this for you, you’re responsible for understanding how to use dApps (decentralized apps), and how the smart contracts work. Without specific knowledge of how the contracts work, traders can make mistakes or errors in executing trades, which can be costly. There’s no insurance if you send money to the wrong address, or a transaction fails and your funds are frozen or locked up. This is not for crypto novices!\\n\\n**Liquidity and security:** CEX’s can meet any liquidity needs because they are matching buyers and sellers. If they can’t accommodate, it won’t allow you to trade. DEX’s on the other hand are much more fluid and subject to change. While you may be able to execute a trade, if the market moves by a considerable amount (everyone trying to sell at once), it may cause a huge fluctuation in the price of the asset you’re looking to purchase, resulting in [slippage](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/slippage).\\n\\nSecurity and unvetted tokens: anyone can create a DEX and launch it. It’s on you as a trader to read their documentation and understand the risks involved before depositing assets onto their platform. Smart contracts are vulnerable to hacks (hackers [stole $130M](https://therecord.media/hackers-steal-130-million-from-cream-finance-the-companys-3rd-hack-this-year/) from CREAM Finance in October of this year), and there’s no insurance or guarantee that your funds are safe in any DEX. Also, while you’re able to swap for thousands of different types of alternative coins on DEX’s, not all of these projects are properly vetted. CEX’s do a good job of vetting projects before listing them on their website, so be careful and know the risks before investing in a new token that has low liquidity or not much information on the team behind it (beware of scams like [Squid Games crypto token](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-59129466)).\\n\\n## Conclusion:\\n\\nGoing back to our farmers market analogy: although the farmers market may cut out the middleman (in this case, Safeway), it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a one stop shop for *all* of your grocery shopping needs. Maybe the farmers market doesn’t accept credit cards and you’re out of cash, or they don’t have all of the ingredients needed for your meal prep. You’ll likely end up purchasing goods from both, which allows more flexibility depending on what you’re cooking and your needs for that week.\\n\\nThis is exactly the same when it comes to using DEX’s and CEX’s. DEX’s are a great option for crypto-savvy traders who want to acquire new coins not listed on CEX’s or take a loan out instead of going through a traditional bank or CEX.\\n\\nTo me, however, the most fascinating part about DEX’s is the ability to automate traditional intermediary tasks out to smart contracts which can run autonomously on a blockchain. It improves efficiency and allows for more participants in the Defi ecosystem, allowing users to trade, lend and borrow without the need for a bank of centralized exchange. All you need is a little crypto balance, a wallet and access to Wifi to begin trading. I’m excited to continue to see innovations across the DEX ecosystem and the next wave of Defi products that we’ll see.\",\"timestamp\":1638979220,\"title\":\"Decentralized exchanges: the farmers market for trading\"},\"digest\":\"DMyZo02fhsq14LjEpIyEo1IQBmVFsJdPTGQTWfhNAW0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x238FAE1cF4Cd3e82CDA997aCF48004fdEa903353\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j15whyg0puDk-ALApfNGkIAvY0_WioKkWXchDNvw9gY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"78oRcNx20NRnVHK4PUum5YFVILNDLh06lEYzw7on76Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kaScjmA6eHmpNi8KPLrJyqBk1D4qm5xHoCH4kqCMz-RjhkJET0yqPgnWi30J7KoycmtCIko1yibLRL9Wv1slyQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9373844c3286a09cb42438956590bd548f5d88246b00ff2ecdaf5b27f034f37f7473db28b0769a68f0ee87711a5b36a5e1d7c9c78006ae52b8c5361e5effc8a51b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"j15whyg0puDk-ALApfNGkIAvY0_WioKkWXchDNvw9gY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"78oRcNx20NRnVHK4PUum5YFVILNDLh06lEYzw7on76Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MypR8Kzm5L2ScYEyNXq_FAQUrapMTI4jBPkTqY6Xppc\"}"
