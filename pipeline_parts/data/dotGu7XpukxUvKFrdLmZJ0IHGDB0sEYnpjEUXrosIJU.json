"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"it is no other newspaper-man's business where you are going.  So, The Herald man at Key West, hearing this, and not knowing I WAS GOING TO THE FLAGSHIP, called Long, making a strong kick about the correspondents, Bonsal, Remington and Paine, who are, or were, with the squadron.  Stenie left two days ago, hoping to get a commission on the staff of General Lee.  So yesterday Scovel told me Long had cabled in answer to The Herald's protests to the admiral as follows:  \\\"Complaints have been received that correspondents Paine, Remington and Bonsal are with the squadron.  Send them ashore at once.  There must be no favoritism.\\\"\\n\\nScovel got the admiral at once to cable Long on his behalf because of his services as a spy, but as Roosevelt had done so much for me, I would not appeal over him, and this morning I sent in word to the admiral that I was leaving the ship and would like to pay my respects.  Sampson is a thin man with a gray beard.  He looks like a college professor and has very fine, gentle eyes.  He asked me why I meant to leave the ship, and I said I had heard one of the torpedo boats was going to Key West, and I thought I would go with her if he would allow it.  He asked if I had seen the cable from Long, and I said I had heard of it, and that I was really going so as not to embarrass him with my presence.  He said, \\\"I have received three different orders from the Secretary, one of them telling me I could have such correspondents on board as were agreeable to me.  He now tells me that they must all go.  You can do as you wish.  You are perfectly welcome to remain until the conflict of orders is cleared up.\\\"  I saw he was mad and that he wanted me to stay, or at least not to go of my own wish, so that he could have a grievance out of it--if he had to send me away after having been told he could have those with him who were agreeable to him.  Captain Chadwick was in the cabin, and said, \\\"Perhaps Mr. Davis had better remain another twenty-four hours.\\\"  The admiral added, \\\"Ships are going to Key West daily.\\\"  Then Chadwick repeated that he thought I had better stay another day, and made a motion to me to do so.  So I said I would, and now I am waiting to see what is going to happen.  Outside, Chadwick told me that something in the way of an experience would probably come off, so I have hopes.  By this time, of course, you know all about it.  I shall finish this later.\\n\\nWe began bombarding Matanzas twenty minutes after I wrote the above.  It was great.  I guess I got a beat, as The Herald tug is the only one in sight.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nFlagship-Off Havana April 30th, 1898. DEAR FAMILY:\\n\\nYou must not mind if I don't write often, but I feel that you see The Herald every day and that tells you of what I am seeing and doing, and I am writing so much, and what with keeping notes and all, I haven't much time-- What you probably want to know is that I am well and that my sciatica is not troubling me at all--Mother always wants to know that.  On the other hand I am on the best ship from which to see things and on the safest, as she can move quicker and is more heavily armored than any save the battleships-- The fact that the admiral is on board and that she is the flagship is also a guarantee that she will not be allowed to expose herself.  I was very badly scared when I first came to Key West for fear I should be left especially when I didn't make the flagship-- But I have not missed a single trick so far-- Bonsal missed the bombardment and so did Stephen Crane-- All the press boats were away except The Herald's.  I had to write the story in fifteen minutes, so it was no good except that we had it exclusively--\\n\\nI am sending a short story of the first shot fired to the Scribner's and am arranging with them to bring out a book on the Campaign.  I have asked them to announce it as it will help me immensely here for it is as an historian and not as a correspondent that I get on over those men who are correspondents for papers only.  I have made I think my position here very strong and the admiral is very much my friend as are also his staff.  Crane on the other hand took the place of Paine who was exceedingly popular with every one and it has made it hard for Crane to get into things-- I am having a really royal time, it is so beautiful by both night and day and there is always color and movement and the most rigid discipline with the most hearty good feeling-- I get on very well with the crew too, one of them got shot by a revolver's going off and I asked the surgeon if I might not help at the operation so that I might learn to be useful, and to get accustomed to the sight of wounds and surgery-- It was a wonderful thing to see, and I was confused as to whether I admired the human body more or the way the surgeon's understood and mastered it-- The sailor would not give way to the ether and I had to hold him for an hour while they took out his whole insides and laid them on the table and felt around inside of him as though he were a hollow watermelon.  Then they put his stomach back and sewed it in and then sewed up his skin and he was just as good as new.  We carried him over to a cot and he came to, and looked up at us.  We were all bare-armed and covered with his blood, and then over at the operating table, which was also covered with his blood.  He was gray under his tan and his lips were purple and his eyes were still drunk with the ether-- But he looked at our sanguinary hands and shook his head sideways on the pillow and smiled-- \\\"You'se can't kill me,\\\" he said, \\\"I'm a New Yorker, by God--you'se can't kill me.\\\" The Herald cabled for a story as to how the crew of the New York behaved in action.  I think I shall send them that although there are a few things the people had better take for  granted-- Of course, we haven't been \\\"in action\\\" yet  but the first bombardment made me nervous until it got  well started.  I think every one was rather nervous and it was chiefly to show them there was nothing to worry about that we fired off the U. S. guns.  They talk like veterans now-- It was much less of a strain than I had expected, there was no standing on your toes nor keeping your mouth open or putting wadding in your ears.  I took photographs most of the time, and they ought to be excellent--what happened was that you were thrown up off the deck just as you are when an elevator starts with a sharp jerk and there was an awful noise like the worst clap of thunder you ever heard close to your ears, then the smoke covered everything and you could hear the shot going through the air like a giant rocket-- The shots they fired at us did not cut any ice except a shrapnel that broke just over the main mast and which reminded me of Greece-- The other shots fell short-- The best thing was to see the Captains of the Puritan and Cincinnati frantically signalling to be allowed to fire too-- A little fort had opened on us from the left so they plugged at that, it was a wonderful sight, the Monitor was swept with waves and the guns seemed to come out of the water.  The Cincinnati did the best of all.  Her guns were as fast as the reports of a revolver, a self-cocking revolver, when one holds the trigger for the whole six.  We got some copies of The Lucha on the Panama and their accounts of what was going on in Havana were the best reading I ever saw-- They probably reported the Matanzas bombardment as a Spanish victory-- The firing yesterday was very tame.  We all sat about on deck and the band played all the time-- We didn't even send the men to quarters-- I do not believe the army intends to move for two weeks yet, so I shall stay here.  They seem to want me to do so, and I certainly want to-- But that army is too slow for words, and we love the \\\"Notes from the Front\\\" in The Tribune, telling about the troops at Chickamauga-- I believe what will happen is that a chance shot will kill some of our men, and the Admiral won't do a thing but knock hell out of whatever fort does it and land a party of marines and bluejackets-- Even if they only occupy the place for 24 hours, it will beat that army out and that's what I want.  They'll get second money in the Campaign if they get any, unless they brace up and come over-- I have the very luck of the British Army, I walked into an open hatch today and didn't stop until I caught by my arms and the back of my neck.  It was very dark and they had opened it while I was in a cabin.  The Jackie whose business it was to watch it was worse scared than I was, and I looked up at him while still hanging to the edges with my neck and arms and said \\\"why didn't you tell me?\\\"  He shook his head and said, \\\"that's so, Sir, I certainly should have told you, I certainly should\\\"-- They're exactly like children and the reason is, I think, because they are so shut off from the contamination of the world.  One of these ships is like living in a monastery, and they are as disciplined and gentle as monks, and as reckless as cowboys.  When I go forward and speak to one of them they all gather round and sit on the deck in circles and we talk and they listen and make the most interesting comments-- The middy who fired the first gun at Matanzas is a modest alert boy about 18 years old and crazy about his work-- So, the Captain selected him for the honor and also because there is such jealousy between the bow and stern guns that he decided not to risk feelings being hurt by giving it to either-- So, Boone who was at Annapolis a month ago was told to fire the shot-- We all took his name and he has grown about three inches.  We told him all of the United States and England would be ringing with his name-- When I was alone he came and sat down on a gull beside me and told me he was very glad they had let him fire that first gun because his mother was an invalid and he had gone into the navy against her wish and he hoped now that she would be satisfied when she saw his name in the papers.  He was too sweet and boyish about it for words and I am going to take a snapshot at him and put his picture in Scribner's--\\\"he only stands about so high--\\\"\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nI enclose a souvenir of the bombardment.  Please keep it carefully for me-- It was the first shot \\\"in anger\\\" in thirty years.\\n\\nTAMPA, May 3rd, 1898. DEAR NORA:\\n\\nWe are still here and probably will be.  It is a merry war, if there were only some girls here the place would be perfect.  I don't know what's the matter with the American girl--here am I--and Stenie and Willie Chanler and Frederick Remington and all the boy officers of the army and not one solitary, ugly, plain, pretty, or beautiful girl.  I bought a fine pony to-day, her name was Ellaline but I thought that was too much glory for Ellaline so I diffused it over the whole company by re-christening her Gaiety Girl, because she is so quiet, all the Gaiety Girls I know are quiet.\\n\\nShe never does what I tell her anyway, so it doesn't matter what I call her.  But when this cruel war is over ($6 a day with bath room adjoining) I am going to have an oil painting of her labelled \\\"Gaiety Girl the Kentucky Mare that carried the news of the fall of Havana to Matanzas, fifty miles under fire and Richard Harding Davis.\\\"  To-morrow I am going to buy a saddle and a servant.  War is a cruel thing especially to army officers.  They have to wear uniforms and are not allowed to take off their trousers to keep cool-- They take off everything else except their hats and sit in the dining room without their coats or collars-- That's because it is war time.  They are terrible brave--you can see it by the way they wear bouquets on their tunics and cigarette badges and Cuban flags and by not saluting their officers.  One General counted today and forty enlisted men passed him without saluting.  The army will have to do a lot of fighting to make itself solid with me.  They are mounted police.  We have a sentry here, he sits in a rocking chair.  Imagine one of Sampson's or Dewey's bluejackets sitting down even on a gun carriage.  Wait till I write my book.  I wouldn't say a word now but when I write that book I'll give them large space rates.  I am writing it now, the first batch comes out in Scribner's in July.\\n\\nto you all.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nDuring the early days of the war, Richard received the appointment of a captaincy, but on the advice of his friends that his services were more valuable as a correspondent, he refused the commission.  The following letter shows that at least at the time my brother regretted the decision, but as events turned out he succeeded in rendering splendid service not only as a correspondent but in the field.\\n\\nTAMPA--May 14, 1898. DEAR CHAS.\\n\\nOn reflection I am greatly troubled that I declined the captaincy.  It is unfortunate that I had not time to consider it.  We shall not have another war and I can always be a war correspondent in other countries but never again have a chance to serve in my own.  The people here think it was the right thing to do but the outside people won't.  Not that I care about that, but I think I was weak not to chance it.  I don't know exactly what I ought to do.  When I see all these kid militia men enlisted it makes me feel like the devil.  I've no doubt many of them look upon it as a sort of a holiday and an outing and like it for the excitement, but it would bore me to death.  The whole thing would bore me if I thought I had to keep at it for a year or more.  That is the fault of my having had too much excitement and freedom.  It spoils me to make sacrifices that other men can make.  Whichever way it comes out I shall be sorry and feel I did not do the right thing.  Lying around this hotel is enough to demoralize anybody.  We are much more out of it than you are, and one gets cynical and loses interest.  On the other hand I would be miserable to go back and have done nothing.  It is a question of character entirely and I don't feel I've played the part at all.  It's all very well to say you are doing more by writing, but are you?  It's an easy game to look on and pat the other chaps on the back with a few paragraphs, that is cheap patriotism.  They're taking chances and you're not and when the war's over they'll be happy and I won't.  The man that enlists or volunteers even if he doesn't get further than Chickamauga or Gretna Green and the man who doesn't enlist at all but minds his own business is much better off than I will be writing about what other men do and not doing it myself, especially as I had a chance of a life time, and declined it.  I'll always feel I lost in character by not sticking to it whether I had to go to Arizona or Governor's Island.  I was unfortunate in having Lee and Remington to advise me.  We talked for two hours in Fred's bedroom and they were both dead against it and Lee composed my telegram to the president.  Now, I feel sure I did wrong.  Shafter did not care and the other officers were delighted and said it was very honorable and manly giving me credit for motives I didn't have.  I just didn't think it was good enough although I wanted it too and I missed something I can never get again.  I am very sad about it.  I know all the arguments for not taking it but as a matter of fact I should have done so.  I would have made a good aide, and had I got a chance I certainly would have won out and been promoted.  That there are fools appointed with me is no answer.  I wouldn't have stayed in their class long.\\n\\nDICK.\\n\\nTAMPA, May 29, 1898. DEAR CHAS.:\\n\\nThe cigars came; they are O. K. and a great treat after Tampa products.  Captain Lee and I went out to the volunteer camps today:  Florida, Alabama, Ohio and Michigan, General Lee's push, and it has depressed me very much.  I have been so right about so many things these last five years, and was laughed at for making much of them.  Now all I urged is proved to be correct; nothing our men wear is right.  The shoes, the hats, the coats, all are dangerous to health and comfort; one-third of the men cannot wear the regulation shoe because it cuts the instep, and buy their own, and the volunteers are like the Cuban army in appearance.  The Greek army, at which I made such sport, is a fine organization in comparison as far as outfit goes; of course, there is no comparison in the spirit of the men.  One colonel of the Florida regiment told us that one-third of his men had never fired a gun.  They live on the ground; there are no rain trenches around the tents, or gutters along the company streets; the latrines are dug to windward of the camp, and all the refuse is burned to WINDWARD.\\n\\nHalf of the men have no uniforms nor shoes.  I pointed out some of the unnecessary discomforts the men were undergoing through ignorance, and one colonel, a Michigan politician, said, \\\"Oh, well, they'll learn.  It will be a good lesson for them.\\\"  Instead of telling them, or telling their captains, he thinks it best that they should find things out by suffering.  I cannot decide whether to write anything about it or not.  I cannot see where it could do any good, for it is the system that is wrong--the whole volunteer system, I mean.  Captain Lee happened to be in Washington when the first Manila outfit was starting from San Francisco, and it was on his representations that they gave the men hammocks, and took a store of Mexican dollars.  They did not know that Mexican dollars are the only currency of the East, and were expecting to pay the men in drafts on New York.\\n\\nIsn't that a pitiable situation when a captain of an English company happens to stray into the war office, and happens to have a good heart and busies himself to see that our own men are supplied with hammocks and spending money.  None of our officers had ever seen khaki until they saw Lee's, nor a cork helmet until they saw mine and his; now, naturally, they won't have anything else, and there is not another one in the country.  The helmets our troops wear would be smashed in one tropical storm, and they are so light that the sun beats through them.  They are also a glaring white, and are cheap and nasty and made of pasteboard.  The felt hats are just as bad; the brim is not broad enough to protect them from the sun or to keep the rain off their necks, and they are made of such cheap cotton stuff that they grow hard when they are wet and heavy, instead of shedding the rain as good felt would do.  They have always urged that our uniforms, though not smart nor \\\"for show,\\\" were for use.  The truth is, as they all admit, that for the tropics they are worse than useless, and that in any climate they are cheap and poor.\\n\\nI could go on for pages, but it has to be written later; now they would only think it was an attack on the army.  But it is sickening to see men being sacrificed as these men will be.  This is the worst season of all in the Philippines.  The season of typhoons and rainstorms and hurricanes, and they would have sent the men off without anything to sleep on but the wet ground and a wet blanket.  It has been a great lesson for me, and I have rubber tents, rubber blankets, rubber coats and hammocks enough for an army corps.  I have written nothing for the paper, because, if I started to tell the truth at all, it would do no good, and it would open up a hell of an outcry from all the families of the boys who have volunteered.  Of course, the only answer is a standing army of a hundred thousand, and no more calling on the patriotism of men unfitted and untrained.  It is the sacrifice of the innocents.  The incompetence and, unreadiness of the French in 1870 was no worse than our own is now.  It is a terrible and pathetic spectacle, and the readiness of the volunteers to be sacrificed is all the more pathetic.  It seems almost providential that we had this false-alarm call with Spain to show the people how utterly helpless they are.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/565](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/565)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639126065,\"title\":\"When I came out here on the Dolphin I said I was going to Tampa, lying just on the principle\"},\"digest\":\"CKvsFDIuSLlC-w2Mjg7BVBv4NVxMs60LuDpuVjrd4-U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBD285526750c6d1e9c301005d31Fcad2bE9E9AA0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G4W07fmJmR7MSIeSoH1_a_FioDzFiCc1t-AF1Fhihsw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iyrqPWCJZdSxFsPFWlDqlpNRdD3wtdLJ0s8hIfYer94\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Z1EfFhT2bgqiLNN4WmA5h-RRkYu-usVgNG19WvzvzLCnNmMdCIlbRB_fdG7TKMA62ttg6ZRIgW6P-Eg5V7dVYA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8facd098c3546a3ec01e04db6b643e9b2f2ba59b2b536a0d353886fd27983e6c700672fb708d363d3d2a27c57f1ede5535fb84b0b5c7a1a822d8ef00abeb57021b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"G4W07fmJmR7MSIeSoH1_a_FioDzFiCc1t-AF1Fhihsw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iyrqPWCJZdSxFsPFWlDqlpNRdD3wtdLJ0s8hIfYer94\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CKvsFDIuSLlC-w2Mjg7BVBv4NVxMs60LuDpuVjrd4-U\"}"
