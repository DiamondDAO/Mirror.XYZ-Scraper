"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> I didn’t know the whole Medusa story when I started drawing her in the summer of 2019. I just wanted to draw a female monster. Why a female monster? Simple. Because I felt like one.\\n\\n![Medusa #35 from Medusa Collection](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TSpRvSsvxZwhVXY7TBpIJ.png?height=1500&width=1200)\\n\\n> \\n> [ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2.5926617272868067e+25](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2.5926617272868067e+25)\\n\\n> I felt like a monster less because of how I saw myself and more because of how other people treated me. People from my past as an art dealer in Los Angeles had stopped emailing me. They didn’t come to my art exhibitions. They were embarrassed to have known me, embarrassed of my choices. At least, that was my narrative. I wasn’t exactly emailing them either. My 12-step sponsor once told me that the world is nothing more than a projection of how you feel about yourself. In which case, I retract my earlier statement. I felt like a monster exactly because I saw myself as one. But enough about that. Back to Medusa.\\n>\\n> When I started drawing Medusa, I had to make choices. Would she be sexy, like in tattoo flash? A pin-up with big scale-y hair and breasts. Or hideous? Like in the original *Clash of the Titans*. Of all the Medusa depictions from over the centuries, which would I choose and why? In the end, I chose art historical sculptures of Medusa by Cellini, Bernini, Canova (all Italian men) from between 1540 and 1805 as my source imagery. Why? You can take the Euro-centric snob out of the art world, but you can’t take the art world out of the Euro-centric snob. Or something like that.\\n\\n![Gian Lorenzo Bernini's \\\"Medusa\\\" circa 1640](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oQ_SKc1vYT3YaM-2X3vXQ.jpg?height=2840&width=2000)\\n\\nIn these sculptures, Medusa was not overly beautiful, nor feminine. She was androgynous. Her hair was not overtly reptilian. I suppose, then, I choose these Medusas for their subtlety—for their *un-Medusa-ness*. I choose them because they were the Medusa-mirror in which I most saw myself.\\n\\nI hadn’t realized that Medusa hadn’t always been a monster. Someone mentioned it to me during a studio visit, prompting me to research. Nothing crazy. Just Wikipedia. And there it was: according to the ancient Roman poet Ovid, Medusa was a beautiful maiden who “had sex with” the Greek God Poseidon in his wife’s temple, the Temple of Athena. When Athena (also a God) found out, she punished Medusa by turning her hair into snakes, her eyes into petrifying lasers. Athena then banished Medusa to a far-away cave where she met her eventual end by Perseus’s sword. Of course, upon further research, I quickly discovered that “had sex with” was really just Wikipedia’s euphemism for *rape.*\",\"timestamp\":1642348466,\"title\":\"Medusa and Me\",\"publication\":\"medusa\"},\"digest\":\"9EseriTj8vzxp8IpSZ9MRIYPVlrL9IBu4TJvmIw0wyM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6088C0Bf7008154732d4DaE756623a97A2D1c49B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ckxTUX-bnX7nRJs16UTmShdTTbhhuoC7Jb3GKIm3UzQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yOywiaYbw0x6DQeQdXHEQ4OWHPykSYMOU6Hzw_GQUf0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Diy7Tzglv3hJWNTZ3bfVdKct2d2-OpAxivv2-DM9GgPdGgeUFTIrV06moOxBU3sFe6feaXug5uL2k_a3Ft1Wvg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x05963434cd0c17c7305881f7f0f34c1b00b35d66b7a837b7e99a57c97810ed1a55b8f6073ecc6aa3370706ccebc5cc75a927abc685944037e0bdd92769cfb9b21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on medusa.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ckxTUX-bnX7nRJs16UTmShdTTbhhuoC7Jb3GKIm3UzQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yOywiaYbw0x6DQeQdXHEQ4OWHPykSYMOU6Hzw_GQUf0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9EseriTj8vzxp8IpSZ9MRIYPVlrL9IBu4TJvmIw0wyM\"}"
