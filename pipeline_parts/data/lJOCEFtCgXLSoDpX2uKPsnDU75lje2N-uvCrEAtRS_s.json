"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1.  My Experience about Traditional Internet Domains**\\n\\nI began to learn about traditional internet domains when I first experienced the bear market in the cryptocurrency world. At that time, some domains were sold in unbelievable high prices. However, after I tried to own and sell serval domains, I found it not very difficult.\\n\\nLater I started trying to sell domains to some companies. It requires the following tips: 1. a sound prediction of the company's future 2. contacting the right people 3. negotiation and communication skills.\\n\\n![My Traditional Internet Domain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/94TKao3T1C4uMNt4_-C8S.png?height=413&width=1612)\\n\\n\\nI ended up selling more than 20 terminal domains. Some of them are quite familiar to many people such as [okex.cn](http://okex.cn) (the OK Exchange).\\n\\n**2.  ENS Domains Caught My Eyes**\\n\\nHow to evaluate the value of a domain? It’s like a woman's skirt, the shorter the better. Domains with shorter length and fewer words are more valuable.\\n\\nBy chance, I stayed up late one night to study ENS domains, a project endorsed by the Ethereum Foundation, the present leader of the crypto domain market. **Then I found a major flaw.**\\n\\nENS (.eth) allows a minimum of three characters to be registered, and users can add emojis ahead of it. Obviously, three-character ENS domains are the shortest and most valuable. The ENS domain will be better if it comes with some cryptocurrency features, such as eth.eth, btc.eth, dao.eth, etc.\\n\\nLet's talk about the shortest three-character domain first. The total number of three-letter domains (excluding special letters) is 17,576. Among all these domains, emojis are much more intuitive than letters and can easily generate MEME attributes. In addition, each ENS domain is an NFT, so emoji ENS domains are much more interesting. For example, if you use Nansen frequently, you'll notice that some diamond hand accounts have been replaced with emoji domains. Therefore, let's take a look at the total number of ENS emoji domains and analyze whether they are valuable.\\n\\n![The Number of Emojis](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ElMFJGvVb-VFc85RoB3WP.png?height=1217&width=2713)\\n\\nThere are about 3,633 emojis at present, and the number will increase every year, so the most valuable ENS emoji domains are those composed of three identical emojis, 3633 in total. As the quantity is not that much, there is still room for price appreciation. I was imagining how cool it would be when I used the ENS emoji domains to travel in the web3 world in the future. I dreamed that I would be rich with ENS domains made up of three identical emojis. I was happy as if I had discovered a new continent.\\n\\n**However, as soon as I started to register, I just found a number of disadvantages on ENS.**\\n\\n**3.  Deadly Bugs of ENS Domains**\\n\\n**I found something very weird on OpenSea**: people could register an ENS domain composed of just one emoji instead of three characters; besides, there were two emoji domains that looked exactly the same, but one was four characters and the other was five characters in length. Why?\\n\\nI sent those domains to my IT friend. He found that these domains were inserted with **zero width joiner, ZWJ** for short, which you can think of as a space character. The ZWJ in ENS is %E2%80%8D. **People can use ZWJs to register different ENS domains that look exactly the same to the naked eyes.** For example, you can use \\\\[a %E2%80%8D %E2%80%8D\\\\], \\\\[%E2%80%8Da %E2%80%8D\\\\]  or \\\\[%E2%80%8D %E2%80%8Da\\\\] to register an ENS domain that appears to be “a.eth”.\\n\\n![\\\"a.eth\\\"](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nq9hpUCnh7zpTZkQc3XHo.png?height=1307&width=2706)\\n\\nAnyone can have the ENS domain ‘vitalik.eth’ which belongs to Vitalik Buterin, just by adding a few ZWJs in between. And there are so many possible combinations to achieve this considering the amounts and places ZWJs can be inserted. There are so many fake domains that look exactly the same. How horrible!\\n\\n**4.  ZWJs Make ENS Worthless**\\n\\nWhy would ZWJs make ENS domains worthless? Look at this picture:\\n\\n![Web3 Username](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/gGktYAsLrK45IaRMq0Cd-.png?height=366&width=680)\\n\\nENS is claimed to be Your web3 username, not just username but also your wallet address. **Because of the carelessness and irresponsibility of the ENS Team, serious mistakes may happen, a series of  scams will occur, and it can make the other valuable ENS domains worthless.**\\n\\nFor example: if I made a phishing website claiming I was Vitalik and lied that you could participate Vitalik’s new project as long as you sent ETHs to my wallet vitalik.eth (which has ZWJs added to it, which looks the same as Vitalik.eth to the naked eyes), many people will get scammed.\\n\\n**With the existence of ZWJs, everyone can register any fake domains that look exactly the same to the naked eyes. If people get scammed and fear to trust ENS domains, all ENS domains will lose their value.**\\n\\nWhy does the ENS domain have ZWJs in it? Because some emoji-combinations look like single emoji, but actually they add ZWJs in the middle to become a combined emoji. The ENS Team should have eliminated these emoji-combinations containing ZWJs at the beginning. Traditional Internet domains like .fm, .ws, .to, .ml also support emojis, but they don't support ZWJs. However, due to the laxity of the ENS Team, **the deadly bugs can not be fixed any more.**\\n\\n![ENS Team's Reply](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/acYzlTmqqn_CKCfY410Yn.png?height=1507&width=1070)\\n\\nThe ENS Team is aware of this situation and they have discussed it on Twitter. **Do they think that adding a yellow exclamation mark to OpenSea will eliminate it?  Is the combination emoji with ZWJs in itself also misjudged?** That's a completely irresponsible solution.\\n\\n![Fake vitalik.eth and beer.eth](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aNsd9GBmxz5F-1XdnQoLC.png?height=1036&width=1784)\\n\\nYou can see some poor people already get scammed. They paid thousands of dollars or even more to buy a fake domain which look exactly the same as the real one. What a pity!\\n\\n![Ridiculous Fisrt ENS in 2022: Fake!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zJg2zPni6KxrADSBs9A_5.png?height=1065&width=782)\\n\\n**It’s ridiculous to see that the first ENS domain in 2022 is a fake.** We can not tell with naked eyes.\\n\\nDo they still have other optimal solutions? Now ENS Team is in an awkward situation and they are running out of solutions to this serious problem.\\n\\n**Will they destroy all ENS domains with ZWJs? Where is their credibility in doing so? Can they prevent scams from arising? Maybe the ENS Team doesn’t treat it as a big problem at this moment, but if one day a huge amount of money is transferred to a fake domain, should the ENS Team feel guilty?**\\n\\nI call on everyone to stop registering any ENS domains, as they are finally worthless in the long run.\\n\\nWe should act like <https://www.illiquidjpegs.xyz/> and throw all these ENS junk domains into the trash address. I expect a more rigorous program to replace ENS. In short, don’t register ENS!\\n\\nThe fraud scandal will break out sooner or later, at that time, responsible exchanges will shelve ENS eventually.\\n\\n@LTChives\",\"timestamp\":1641490661,\"title\":\"Your ENS Domain May Be Worthless Due to ZWJs Frauds\"},\"digest\":\"nw8AQzsZsVpZpigNHFkj9mz8v2X5p1_FD0IFCX1u0i8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x888eb25227D153f4d7D2A153dA24a9F54D998377\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DVFvfQ7cCmx9Iz3kwEVPl1tpV8mJOhdSqolEBHjzfcc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"El6LXFz6s8n1yfRKKiWlaOxYbkdh9d4EZsS-t3-iPH8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"foBgcc3vxj_eAy1nHARGFWVjVplWLdYa_twghECDWVC5lmEj_JdUnQuzg18c8OI3EjhowzwS_kIAHlW_W5L4Fw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x439dfb940a9a50fb831d067911668e1dedd719ad161247b90edfc72f6c88b59e688a8e7e16e63836b716de97cb47aead1fea49d2781ed2e99b4bcd1c3fca2e901b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DVFvfQ7cCmx9Iz3kwEVPl1tpV8mJOhdSqolEBHjzfcc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"El6LXFz6s8n1yfRKKiWlaOxYbkdh9d4EZsS-t3-iPH8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nw8AQzsZsVpZpigNHFkj9mz8v2X5p1_FD0IFCX1u0i8\"}"
