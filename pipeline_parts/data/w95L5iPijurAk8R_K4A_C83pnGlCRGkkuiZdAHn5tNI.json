"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The use of altitude training in game players Team sports are in constant development of new training methodologies that enhance performance to match the high physical demands of competition at sea level (Farrow et al., 2008). Short high-intensity intervals with minimal resting periods are found during team-based sport matches and it is suggested that high altitude training methods; for instance, live-high train-high (LHTH), live-high train-low (LHTL) and intermittent hypoxic training (IHT) may be associated with greater improvements in the physiological capacities of the athletes (Billaut et al., 2012). Elite sport team athletes will play matches at intensities around 85% of their maximal heart rate, thus having well-trained aerobic, anaerobic and recovery capacities are a key factor for a greater team performance (Bishop and Girard, 2013). However, the use of altitude training (hypoxia training \\\\~3000m) to enhance performance in team sport athletes it is in the early stages and further research is needed to corroborate and expand the information found in the studies carried out in individual athletes (e.g., triathletes). \\n\\nWell-developed anaerobic capacity plays a vital role in team sports conditioning programmes to reduce the risk of injury (Escamilla and Wickham, 2003) and to enhance the maximal forces applied during short high intensity interval sprints (Bishop and Girard, 2013). Nishimura et al (2010) showed that hypoxia alone has no correlation to the increase in muscle strength and sprint performance where the oxygen levels are normal (normoxia) (cited in Bishop and Girard, 2013). However, it is suggested that the combination of strength training alongside IHT generate greater development of muscle strength (Manimmanakorn, 2013). The greater improvement in muscle strength throughout IHT occurs due to the higher accumulation of blood lactate and androgens as a result of the reduction of available oxygen along with a faster innervation of fast twitch muscle fibres (type II) (Melissa et al., 1997). There is only one study published which investigated the performance of strength training during hypoxia in team sports athletes (netball). Manimmanakorn et al (2013) found that 5 weeks of low-volume strength training with blood flow restriction or under hypoxic conditions developed higher levels of muscular strength (15% increase) in comparison to regular training during normoxia. A scarcity of empirical research investigating how team sport athletes can benefit from strength training in hypoxic conditions means the results in the previous study have not been yet corroborated by any other team-based sports or peer reviewed studies.\\n\\nIn addition to increase anaerobic capacity, team sport athletes seek to develop aerobic metabolism to enhance performance during competition, it has been suggested that LHTH and LHTL methods may provide some benefits to increase aerobic athletic performance (Billaut et al., 2012). LHTH is performed in conventional altitude camps (\\\\~2500m), lasting between 15 to 30 days and it comprises of 3 or 4 phases (Millet et al., 2010). Three main favourable adaptations have been found for this methodology in a meta-analysis carried out by Lobigs et al (2018); higher stimulation of red blood cells (Erythropoiesis), better delivery of oxygen from the blood to the muscles and an increase in muscular adaptations. On the other hand, it has been reported that during LHTH protocols, blood viscosity has increased which reduces muscle blood flow alongside lower cardiac output where not enough blood is supplied to the muscles during the aerobic phase (Muraoka and Gando, 2012). Moreover, Wilber (2007) reported substantially decrease in training intensity and loss of aerobic capacity in endurance athletes during LHTH. \\n\\nThe LHTL method was developed as a possible solution to the deficiencies of LHTH and it is suggested to be an efficient approach to increase aerobic capacity, where athletes are required live and rest at least 16h per day in hypoxia (\\\\~3000m) and training at low altitude (1000m1500m) during 3 to 5 weeks (Millet et al., 2010). Positive haematological and performance adaptations have been found during LHTL; VO2max increased (5%) and erythropoiesis is greater than in LHTH (Levine and Stray-Gundersen, 1997) alongside an increment of 1.5% in performance during short time events (20 minutes max) (Gore et al., 2007). However, Robertson et al (2010) showed the evidence that using only one altitude training methodology such LHTL or LHTH is not enough to induce enhancements in the physiological capacities to improve aerobic performance and were combining both (LH-TL+TH) can increase substantially VO2max and haematological adaptations. \\n\\nIn conclusion, high altitude training methods provide numerous benefits to the physiological capacities to increase performance, there is evidence showing the increase of 15% in muscular strength when combining IHT with strength training. However, there is only one study available investigating the increase of strength during hypoxia in team sport athletes and further research is needed to corroborate these assumptions (Manimmanakorn, 2013). LHTH and LHTL appear to be beneficial to increase aerobic capacity, diverse haematological and performance adaptations have been reported such us, increased VO2max (5%), higher stimulation of red blood cells and better delivery of oxygen from the blood to the muscles (Lobigs et al 2017; Levine and Stray-Gundersen, 1997). Although Wilber (2007) argues these findings showing the loss of aerobic capacity during LHTH. Moreover, Robertson et al (2010) demonstrate that combining methodologies induce greater enhancement in aerobic performance. \\n\\n**Reference List** \\n\\n* Billaut, F., Gore, C. J. and Aughey, R.
