"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"when he came to tie his cravat, he hesitated for a moment?  However, after reflection, he adjusted the knot as before, and would you believe it, he tied this famous, this regular knot without concentrating any attention upon it?  His toilet finished, he went to the window.  A sudden change had taken place in the weather; a cold, drizzly rain was falling noiselessly; very little wind; the horizon was enveloped in a thick fog; a long train of low clouds, looking like gigantic fish, floated slowly through the valley of the Rhine; the sky of a uniform gray, seemed to distill weariness and sadness; land and water were the color of mud.  Gilbert cast his eyes upon his dear precipice: it was but a pit of frightful ugliness.  He sank into an armchair.  His thoughts harmonized with the weather; they formed a dismal landscape, over which a long procession of gloomy fancies and sinister apprehensions swept silently, like the trail of low clouds which wandered along the borders of the Rhine. \\\"No, a thousand times no!\\\" mused he, \\\"I can't stay in this place any longer; I shall lose my strength here, and my spirit and my health, too.  To be exposed to the blind hatred of an unhappy child whose sorrows drive him to insanity; to be the table companion of a priest without dignity or moral elevation, who silently swallows the greatest outrages; to become the intimate, the complaisant friend of a great lord, whose past is suspicious, of an unnatural father who hates his son, of a man who at times transforms himself into a specter, and who, stung by remorse, or thirsting for revenge, fills the corridors of his castle with savage howlings-- such a position is intolerable, and I must leave here at any cost! This castle is an unhealthy place; the walls are odious to me!  I will not wait to penetrate into their secrets any further.\\\" And Gilbert ransacked his brain for a pretext to quit Geierfels immediately.  While engaged in this research, some one knocked at the door: it was Fritz, with his breakfast. This morning he had the self-satisfied air of a fool who has worked out a folly by the sweat of his brow, and reached the fortunate moment when he can bring his invention to light.  He entered without salutation, placed the tray which he carried upon the table; then, turning to Gilbert, who was seated, said to him, winking his eye: \\\"Good-morning, comrade!  Comrade, good-morning!\\\" \\\"What do you say?\\\" said Gilbert, astonished, and looking at him steadily. \\\"I say: Good-morning, comrade!\\\" replied he, smiling agreeably. \\\"And to whom are you speaking, if you please?\\\" \\\"I am speaking to you, yourself, my comrade, and I say to you, good-morning, comrade! good-morning.\\\" Gilbert looked at him attentively, trying to find some explanation of this strange prank, and this excessive and astounding insolence. \\\"And will you tell me,\\\" he continued, after a few moments' silence, \\\"will you be good enough to tell me, who gave you permission to call me comrade?\\\" \\\"It was . . . it was . . .\\\" answered Fritz, hemming and hawing. And he reflected a moment, as though trying to remember his lesson, that he might not stumble in its recital.  \\\"Ah!\\\" resumed he, \\\"it was simply his Excellency the Count, and I cannot conceive what you see astonishing in it.\\\" \\\"Have you ever heard the Count,\\\" demanded Gilbert, who felt the blood boiling in his veins, \\\"call me your comrade?\\\" \\\"Ah! certainly!\\\" he answered with a long burst of laughter.  \\\"Every day, when I come from him, M. le Comte says to me: 'Well! how is your comrade Gilbert?'  And isn't it very natural?  Don't we eat at the same rack?  Are we not, both of us, in the service of the same master?  And don't you see. . . .\\\" He was not able to say more, for Gilbert bounded from his chair, and crying: \\\"Go and tell your master that he is not my master!\\\"  He seized the valet de chambre by the collar.  He was at least a head shorter than his adversary, but his grasp was like iron; and in spite of appearances, great Fritz proved but a weak and nerveless body, and greatly surprised at this unexpected attack, he could only open his large mouth and utter some inarticulate sounds.  Gilbert had already dragged him to the top of the staircase.  Then Fritz, recovering from his first flurry, tried to struggle, but he lost his footing, stumbled, and fell headlong down the staircase to the bottom.  Gilbert came near following him in his descent, but fortunately saved himself by clinging to the balustrade.  As he saw him rolling, he feared that he had been too violent, but felt reassured, when he saw him scramble up, feel himself, rub his back, turn to shake his fist and limp away. He returned to his chamber and breakfasted peaceably. \\\"Quite an opportune adventure,\\\" thought he.  \\\"Now, I shall be inflexible, unyielding, and if my trunks are not packed before night, I'm an idiot.\\\" Gathering up under his arm a bundle of papers which were needed for the day's work, he left the room, his head erect and his spirits animated; but he had hardly descended the first flight of steps before his exaltation gave way to very different feelings.  He could not look without shuddering at the place where he had stood like one petrified, listening to the horrible groans of the somnambulist.  He stopped, and, looking at the packet which he held under his arm, thought to himself that it was with a specter he was about to discuss Byzantine history.  Then resuming his walk, he arrived at M. Leminof's study, where he almost expected to see the formidable apparition of last night appear before his eyes, and hear a sepuchral voice crying out to him: \\\"Those eyes behind the door were yours!\\\"  He remained motionless a few seconds, his hand upon his heart.  At last he knocked.  A voice cried: \\\"Come in. He opened the door and entered.  Heavens! how far was the reality from his fancy. M. Leminof was quietly seated in the embrasure of the window, looking at the rain and playing with his monkey.  He no sooner perceived his secretary than he uttered an exclamation of joy, and after shutting up Solon in an adjoining room, he approached Gilbert, took both his hands in his and pressed them cordially, saying in an affectionate tone: \\\"Welcome, my dear Gilbert, I have been looking for you impatiently. I have been thinking a great deal since yesterday on our famous problem of the Slavonic invasions, and I am far from being convinced by your arguments.  Be on your guard, my dear sir!  Be on your guard!  I propose to give you some thrusts that will trouble you to parry.\\\" Gilbert, who had recovered his tranquillity, seated himself, and the discussion commenced.  The point in dispute was the question of the degree of importance and influence of the establishment of the Slavonians in the Byzantine empire during the middle ages.  Upon this question, much debated at present, Count Kostia had espoused the opinion most favorable to the ambitions of Muscovite policy. He affected to renounce his country and to censure it without mercy; he had even denationalized himself to the extent of never speaking his mother tongue and of forbidding its use in his house. In fact, the idiom of Voltaire was more familiar to him than that of Karamzin, and he had accustomed himself for a long time even to think in French.  In spite of all this, and of whatever he might say, he remained Russian at heart: this is a quality which cannot be lost. Twelve o'clock sounded while they were at the height of the discussion. \\\"If you agree, my dear Gilbert,\\\" said M. Leminof, \\\"we will give ourselves a little relaxation.  Indeed you're truly a terrible fellow; there's no persuading you.  Let us breakfast in peace, if you please, like two good friends; afterwards we will renew the fight.\\\" The breakfast was invariably composed of toast au caviar and a small glass of Madeira wine; and every day at noon they suspended work for a few moments to partake of this little collation. \\\"Judge of my presumption,\\\" suddenly said M. Leminof, underscoring, so to speak, every word, \\\"I passed LAST NIGHT \\\\[and he put a wide space between these two words\\\\] in pleading against you the cause of my Slavonians.  My arguments seemed to me irresistible.  I beat you all hollow.  I am like those fencers who are admirable in the training school, but who make a very bad figure in the field.  I had prodigious eloquence LAST NIGHT; I don't know what has become of it; it seems to have fled like a phantom at the first crowing of the cock.\\\" As he pronounced these words, Count Kostia fixed such piercing eyes on Gilbert, that they seemed to search through to the most remote recesses of his soul.  Gilbert sustained the attack with perfect sangfroid. \\\"Ah! sir,\\\" replied he coolly, \\\"I don't know how you argue at night; but I assure you by day you're the most formidable logician I know.\\\" Gilbert's tranquil air dissipated the suspicion which seemed to weigh upon M. Leminof. \\\"You act,\\\" said he gayly, \\\"like those conquerors who exert themselves to console the generals they have beaten, thereby enhancing their real glory; but bah! arms are fickle, and I shall have my revenge at an early day.\\\" \\\"I venture to suggest that you do not delay it long,\\\" answered Gilbert in a grave tone.  \\\"Who knows how much longer I may remain at Geierfels?\\\" These words re-awakened the suspicions of the Count. \\\"What do you mean?\\\" exclaimed he. Whereupon Gilbert related in a firm, distinct tone the morning's adventure.  As he advanced in the recital, he became warmer and repeated with an indignant air the remark which Fritz had attributed to the Count, and strongly emphasized his answer: \\\"Go and tell your master that he is not my master.\\\" He flattered himself that he would pique the Count; he saw him already raising his head, and speaking in the clouds.  He was destined to be mistaken today in all his conjectures.  From the first words of his eloquent recital, Count Kostia appeared to be relieved of a pre-occupation which had disturbed him.  He had been prepared for something else, and was glad to find himself mistaken. He listened to the rest with an undisturbed air, leaning back in his easy-chair with his eyes fixed on the ceiling.  When Gilbert had finished-- \\\"And tell me, pray,\\\" said he, without changing his posture, \\\"how did you punish this rascal?\\\" \\\"I took him by the collar,\\\" replied Gilbert, \\\"and flung him down head first.\\\" \\\"Peste!\\\" exclaimed the Count, raising himself and looking at him with an air of surprise and admiration.  \\\"And tell me,\\\" resumed he, smiling in his enjoyment, \\\"did this domestic animal perish in his fall?\\\" \\\"He may perhaps have broken his arms or legs.  I didn't take the trouble to inquire.\\\" M. Leminof rose and folded his arms on his breast. \\\"See now, how liable our judgments are to be led astray, and how full of sense that Russian proverb is which says: 'It takes more than one day to compass a man!'  Yesterday you had such a sentimental pathetic air, when I permitted myself to administer a little correction to my serf, that I took you in all simplicity for a philanthropist.  I retract it now.  You are one of those tyrants who are only moved for the victims of another.  Pure professional jealousy!  But,\\\" continued he, \\\"there is one thing which astonishes me still more, and that is, that you Gilbert, you could for an instant believe--\\\" He checked himself, bent forward towards Gilbert, and looked at him scrutinizingly, making a shade of his two bony hands extended over his enormous eyebrows; then taking him by the arm, he led him to the embrasure of the window, and as if he had made a sudden change in his person which rendered him irrecognizable: \\\"Nothing could be better than your throwing the scoundrel downstairs,\\\" said he, \\\"and if he is not quite dead, I shall drive him from here without pity; but that you should have believed that I, Count Leminof--  Oh! it is too much, I dream--  No, you are not the Gilbert that I know, the Gilbert I love, though I conceal it from myself--\\\" And taking him by both hands, he added: \\\"This man was silly enough to tell you that I was your master, and you replied to him with the Mirabeau tone: 'Go and tell your master--'  My dear Gilbert, in the name of reason, I ask you to remember that the true is never the opposite of the false; it is another thing, that is all; but to which I add, that in answering as you did, you have cruelly compromised yourself.  We should never contradict a fool; it is running the risk of being like him.\\\" Gilbert blushed.  He did not try to amend anything, but readily changing his tactics, he said, smiling: \\\"I implore you, sir, not to drive this man away.  I want him to stay to remind me occasionally that I am liable to lose my senses.\\\" But what were his feelings when the Count, having sent for this valet de chambre, said to him: \\\"You have not done this on your own responsibility--you received orders.  Who gave them?\\\" Fritz answered, stammering: \\\"Do please forgive me, your excellency!  It was M. Stephane who, yesterday evening, made me a present of two Russian crowns on condition that every morning for a week I should say to M. Saville, 'good-morning, comrade.'\\\" A flash of joy shone in the Count's eyes.  He turned towards Gilbert, and pressing his hand, said to him: \\\"For this once I thank you cordially for having addressed your complaints to me.  The affair is more serious than I had thought. There is a malignant abscess there, which must be lanced once for all.\\\" This surgical comparison made Gilbert shudder; he cursed his hasty passion and his stupidity.  Why had he not suspected the real culprit?  Why was it necessary for him to justify the hatred which Stephane had avowed towards him? \\\"And how happens it, sir,\\\" resumed Count Kostia, with less of anger in his tone, \\\"that you have an opportunity of holding secret conversations with my son in the evening?  When did you enter his service?  Do you not know that you are to receive neither orders, messages, nor communications of any kind from him?\\\" Fritz, who in his heart blessed the admirable invention of lightning rods, explained as well as he could, that the evening before, in going up to his excellency's room, he had met Ivan on the staircase, going down to the grand hall to find a cap which his young master had forgotten.  Apparently he had neglected to close the wicket, for Fritz, in going out through the gallery, had found Stephane, who, approaching him stealthily, had given him his little lesson in a mysterious tone, and as Ivan returned at this moment without the cap he said: \\\"Dost thou not see, imbecile, that it's on my head,\\\" and he drew the cap from his pocket and proudly put it on his head, while he ran to his rooms laughing. When he had finished his story, Fritz was profuse in his protestations of repentance, servile and tearful; the Count cut him short, declaring to him, that at the request of Gilbert he consented to pardon him; but that at the first complaint brought against him, he would give him but two hours to pack.  When he had gone out, M. Leminof pulled another bell which communicated with the room of Ivan, who presently appeared. \\\"Knowest thou, my son,\\\" said the Count to him in German, \\\"that thou hast been very negligent for some time?  Thy mind fails, thy sight is feeble.  Thou art growing old, my poor friend.  Thou art like an old bloodhound in his decline, without teeth and without scent, who knows neither how to hunt the prey nor how to catch it.  Thou must be on the retired list.  I have already thought of the office I shall give thee in exchange. . . .  Oh! do not deceive thyself.  It is in vain to shrug thy shoulders, my son; thou art wrong in believing thyself necessary.  By paying well I shall easily find one who will be worth as much--\\\" Ivan's eyes flashed. \\\"I do not believe you,\\\" replied he, in Russian; \\\"you know very well that you are not amiable, but that I love you in spite of it, and when you have spent a hundred thousand roubles, you will not have secured one to replace me, whose affection for you will be worth a kopeck.\\\" \\\"Why dost thou speak Russian?\\\" resumed the Count.  \\\"Thou knowest well that I have forbidden it.  Apparently thou wishest that no one but myself may understand the sweet things which thou sayest to me. Go and cry them upon the roof, if that will give thee pleasure; but I have never asked thee to love me.  I exact only faithful service on thy part, and I answer for it that thy substitute, when his young master shall tell him 'go and find my cap, which I have left in the grand hall,' will answer him coolly: 'I am not blind, my little father, your cap is in your pocket.'\\\" Ivan looked at his master attentively, and the expression of his face appeared to reassure him, for he began to smile. \\\"Meantime,\\\" said the Count, \\\"so long as I keep thee in thy office, study to satisfy me.  Go to thy room and reflect, and at the end of a quarter of an hour, bring thy little father here to me; I want to talk with him, and I will permit thee to listen, if that will give thee pleasure.\\\" As soon as Ivan had gone, Gilbert begged M. Leminof not to pursue this miserable business.  \\\"I have punished Fritz,\\\" said he, \\\"with perhaps undue severity; you yourself have rebuked and threatened him; I am satisfied.\\\" \\\"Pardon me.  In all this Fritz was but an instrument.  It would not be right to allow the real culprit to go unpunished!\\\" \\\"It is no trouble to me to pardon that culprit,\\\" exclaimed Gilbert, with an animation beyond his control, \\\"he is so unhappy!\\\" M. Leminof gave Gilbert a haughty and angry look.  He strode through the room several times, his hands behind his back; then, with the easy tempered air of an absolute prince, who condescends to some unreasonable fancy of one of his favorites, made Gilbert sit down, and placing himself by his side: \\\"My dear sir,\\\" said he to him, \\\"your last words show a singular forgetfulness on your part of our reciprocal agreements.  You had engaged, if you remember, not to take any interest in any one here but yourself and myself.  After that, what difference can it make to you, whether my son is happy or unhappy?  Since, however, you have raised this question, I consent to an explanation; but let it be fully understood, that you are never, never, to revive the subject again.  You can readily perceive, that if your society is agreeable to me, it is because I have the pleasure of forgetting with you the petty annoyances of domestic life.  And now speak frankly, and tell me what makes you conclude that my son is unhappy.\\\" Gilbert had a thousand things to reply, but they were difficult to say.  So he hesitated to answer for a moment, and the Count anticipated him: \\\"Mon Dieu! I must needs proceed in advance of your accusations, a concession which I dare to hope you will appreciate.  Perhaps you reproach me with not showing sufficient affection for my son in daily life.  But what can you expect?  The Leminofs are not affectionate.  I don't remember ever to have received a single caress from my father.  I have seen him sometimes pat his hounds, or give sugar to his horse; but I assure you that I never partook of his sweetmeats or his smiles, and at this hour I thank him for it.  The education which he gave me hardened the affections, and it is the best service which a father can render his son.  Life is a hard stepmother, my dear Gilbert; how many smiles have you seen pass over her brazen lips!  Besides, I have particular reasons for not treating Stephane with too much tenderness.  He seems to you to be unhappy, he will be so forever if I do not strive to discipline his inclinations and to break his intractable disposition.  The child was born under an evil star.  At once feeble and violent, he unites with very ardent passions a deplorable puerility of mind; incapable of serious thought, the merest trivialities move him to fever heat, and he talks childish prattle with all the gestures of great passion.  And what is worse, interesting himself greatly in himself, he thinks it very natural that this interest should be shared by all the world.  Do not imagine that his is a loving heart that feels a necessity of spending itself on others.  He likes to make his emotions spectacular, and as his impressions are events for him, he would like to display them, even to the inhabitants of Sirius.  His soul is like a lake swept by a gale of wind that would drive a man-of-war at the rate of twenty-five knots an hour; and on this lake Stephane sails his squadrons of nutshells, and he sees them come, go, tack, run around, and capsize.  He keeps his log- book very accurately, pompously registers all the shipwrecks, and as these spectacles transport him with admiration, he is indignant to find that he alone is moved by them.  This is what makes him unhappy; and you will agree with me that it is not my fault.  The regime which I prescribe for my invalid may appear to you a little severe, but it's the only way by which I can hope to cure him. Leading a regular, uniform life,--and sad enough I admit--he will gradually become surfeited with his own emotions when the objects of them are never renewed, and he will end, I hope, by demanding the diversions of work and study.  May he be able some day to discover that a problem of Euclid is more interesting than the wreck of a nutshell!  Upon that day he will enter upon full convalescence, and I shall not be the last to rejoice in it.\\\" M. Leminof spoke in a tone so serious and composed, that for a few moments Gilbert could have imagined him a pedagogue gravely explaining his maxims of education; but he could not forget that expression of ferocious joy which was depicted on his face at the moment when Stephane fled sobbing from the garden, and he remembered also the somnambulist who, on the preceding night, had uttered certain broken phrases in regard to a LIVING PORTRAIT and a BURIED SMILE.  These mysterious words, terrible in their obscurity, had appeared to him to allude to Stephane, and they accorded badly with the airs of paternal solicitude which M. Leminof had deigned to affect in the past few minutes.  He had a show of reason, however, in his argument; and the picture which he drew of his son, if cruelly exaggerated, had still some points of resemblance.  Only Gilbert had reason to think that the Count purposely confounded cause and effect, and that Stephane's malady was the work of the physician. \\\"Will you permit me, sir,\\\" answered he, \\\"to tell you all that I have on my heart?\\\" \\\"Speak, speak, improve the opportunity: I swear to you it won't occur again.\\\" And looking at his watch: \\\"You have still five minutes to talk with me about my son.  Hurry; I will not grant you two seconds more.\\\" \\\"I have heard it said,\\\" resumed Gilbert, \\\"that in building bridges and causeways, the best foundations are those which HUMOR the waves of the sea.  These are foundations with inclined slopes, which, instead of breaking the waves abruptly, check their movement by degrees, and abate their force without violence.\\\" \\\"You favor anodynes, Monsieur disciple of Galen,\\\" exclaimed M. Leminof.  \\\"Each one according to his temperament.  We cannot reconstruct ourselves.  I am a very violent, very passionate man, and when, for example, a servant offends me I throw him headforemost downstairs.  This happens to me every day.\\\" \\\"Between your son and your valet de chambre, the difference is great,\\\" answered Gilbert, a little piqued. \\\"Did not your famous revolution proclaim absolute equality between all men?\\\" \\\"In the law it is admirable, but not in the heart of a father.\\\" \\\"Good God!\\\" cried the Count, \\\"I do not know that I have a father's heart for my son; I know only that I think a great deal about him, and that I strive according to my abilities to correct in him very grave faults, which threaten to compromise his future welfare.  I know also for a certainty that this whiner enjoys some pleasures of which many children of his age are deprived, as, for example, a servant for himself, a horse, and as much money as he wants for his petty diversions.  You are not ignorant of the use which he makes of this money, neither in regard to the two thalers expended yesterday to corrupt my valet, nor of the seven crowns with which he purchased the delightful pleasure, the other day in your presence, of having his foot kissed by a troop of young rustics. And at this point, I will tell you that Ivan has reported to me that, on the same day, Stephane turned up his sleeve to make you admire a scar which he carried upon one of his wrists.  Oblige me by telling me what blue story he related to you on this subject.\\\" This unexpected question troubled Gilbert a little. \\\"To conceal nothing from you,\\\" answered he hesitatingly, \\\"he told me, that for an escapade which he had made, he had been condemned to pass a fortnight in a dungeon in irons.\\\" \\\"And you believed it!\\\" cried the Count, shrugging his shoulders. \\\"The truth is, that, for a fortnight, I compelled my son to pass one hour every evening in an uninhabited wing of this castle; my intention was not so much to punish him for an act of insubordination, as to cure him of the foolish terrors by which he is tormented, for this boy of sixteen, who often shows himself brave even to rashness, believes in ghosts, in apparitions, in vampires.  I ought to authorize him to guard himself at night by the best-toothed of my bulldogs.  Oh what a strange compound has God given me for a son!\\\" At this moment the sound of steps was heard in the corridor. \\\"In the name of the kind friendship which you profess for me, sir,\\\" exclaimed Gilbert, seizing one of M. Leminof's hands, \\\"I beg of you, do not punish this child for a boyish freak for which I forgive him with all my heart!\\\" \\\"I can refuse you nothing, my dear Gilbert,\\\" answered he with a smiling air.  \\\"I spare him from his pretended dungeons.  I dare hope that you will give me credit for it.\\\" \\\"I thank you; but one thing more: the flowers you deprived him of.\\\" \\\"Mon Dieu! since you wish it, we will have them restored to him, and to please you, I will content myself with having him make apologies to you in due form.\\\" \\\"Make apologies to me!\\\" cried Gilbert in consternation; \\\"but that will be the most cruel of punishments.\\\" \\\"We will leave him the choice,\\\" said the Count dryly.  And as Gilbert insisted: \\\"This time you ask too much!\\\" added he in a tone which admitted of no reply.  \\\"It is a question of principles, and in such matters I never compromise.\\\" Gilbert perceived that even in Stephane's interest, it was necessary to desist, but he understood also to what extent the pride of the young man would suffer, and cursed himself a thousand times for having spoken. Someone knocked at the door. \\\"Come in,\\\" cried the Count in a hoarse voice; and Stephane entered, followed by Ivan.\\n\\nX\\n\\nStephane remained standing in the middle of the room.  He was paler than usual, and kept his eyes on the floor; but his bearing was good, and he affected a resolute air which he rarely displayed in the presence of his father.  The Count remained silent for some time; he gazed with a cold eye on the supple and delicate body of his son, the exquisite elegance of his form, his fine and delicate features, framed in the slightly darkened gold of his hair.  Never had the beauty of his child filled the heart of his father with keener bitterness.  As for Gilbert, he had eyes only for a little black spot which he noticed for the first time upon the uniformly pale complexion of Stephane: it was like an almost imperceptible fly, under the left corner of his mouth. \\\"That is the mole,\\\" thought he, and he fancied he could hear the voice of the somnambulist cry: \\\"Take away that mole! it hurts me!\\\" Shuddering at this recollection, he felt tempted to rush from the room; but a look from the Count recalled him to himself; he made a strong effort to master his emotion, and fixing his eyes upon the window, he looked at the falling rain. \\\"As a preliminary question,\\\" suddenly exclaimed the Count, speaking to his son; \\\"do me the favor, sir, to tell me how much time you have passed in what you call a dungeon, for I do not remember.\\\" Stephane's face colored with a vivid blush.  He hesitated a moment and then answered: \\\"I was there in all fifteen hours, which appeared to me as long as fifteen days.\\\" \\\"You see!\\\" said the Count, looking at Gilbert.  \\\"And now,\\\" resumed he, \\\"let us come to the point; a scene of the greatest impropriety occurred in this house this morning.  Fritz, my valet, in presenting himself to my secretary, who is my friend, permitted himself to say three times: 'Good-morning, comrade; comrade, good- morning!'\\\" At these words Stephane's lips contracted slightly, as if about to smile; but the smile was arrested on its way. \\\"My little story amuses you, apparently,\\\" pursued the Count, raising his head. \\\"It is the incredible folly of Fritz which diverts me,\\\" answered Stephane. \\\"His folly seems to me less than his insolence,\\\" replied the Count; \\\"but without discussing words, I am delighted to see that you disavow his conduct.  I ought not to conceal from you the fact, that this scoundrel wished to make me believe that he acted upon your orders, and I was resolved to punish you severely.  I see now that he has lied, and it remains for me but to dismiss him in disgrace.\\\"  Gilbert trembled lest Stephane's veracity should succumb under this temptation; the young man hesitated but an instant. \\\"I am the guilty one,\\\" answered he in a firm voice, \\\"and it is I who should be punished.\\\" \\\"What,\\\" said M. Leminof, \\\"was it then my son, who, availing himself of the only resources of his mind, conceived this truly happy idea. The invention was admirable, it does honor to your genius.  But if Fritz has been but the instrument to carry out your sublime conceptions, why do you laugh at his stupidity?\\\" \\\"Oh, poor soul!\\\" replied Stephane, with animation, \\\"oh! the donkey, how he spoiled my idea!  I didn't order him to call M. Saville his comrade, but to treat him as a comrade, which is a different thing. Unfortunately I had not time to give him minute instructions, and he misunderstood me, but he did what he could conscientiously to earn his fee.  The poor fellow must be pardoned.  I am the only guilty one, I repeat it.  I am the one to be punished.\\\" \\\"And might we know, sir,\\\" said the Count, \\\"what your intention was in causing M. Saville to be insulted by a servant?\\\" \\\"I wished to humiliate him, to disgust him, and to force him to leave this house.\\\" \\\"And your motive?\\\" \\\"My motive is that I hate him!\\\" answered he in a hoarse voice. \\\"Always exaggerations,\\\" replied the Count sneeringly.  \\\"Can you not, sir, rid yourself of this detestable habit of perpetual exaggeration in the expression of your thoughts?  Can I not impress upon your mind the maxims upon this subject which two men of equal genius have given us: M. de Metternich and Pigault Lebrun!  The first of these illustrious men used to say that superlatives were the seals of fools, and the second wrote these immortal words: \\\"'Everything exaggerated is insignificant.'\\\"  Then extending his arm: \\\"To hate! to hate!\\\" exclaimed he.  \\\"You say the word glibly.  Do you know what it is?  Sorrow, anger, jealousy, antipathy, aversion, you may know all these; but hatred, hatred!--you have no right to say this terrible word.  Ah! hatred is a rough work! it is ceaseless torture, it is a cross of lead to carry, and to sustain its weight without breaking down requires very different shoulders than yours!\\\" At this moment Stephane ventured to look his father in the face. He slowly uplifted his eyes, inclining his head backward.  His look signified \\\"You are right, I will take your word for it; you are better acquainted with it than I.\\\" But the Count's face was so terrible that Stephane closed his eyes and resumed his former attitude.  A slight shudder agitated his whole frame.  The Count perceived that he was near forgetting himself, and drove back the bitter wave which came up from his heart to his lips in spite of himself: \\\"Besides, my young friend here is the least detestable being in the world,\\\" pursued he in a tranquil tone.  \\\"Judge for yourself; just now he pleaded your cause to me with so much warmth, that he drew from me a promise not to punish you for what he has the kindness to call only a boy's freak.  He even stipulates that I shall restore you your flowers, which he pretends give you delight, and within an hour Ivan will have carried them to your room.  In short, two words of apology are all he requires of you.  You must admit that one could not have a more accommodating disposition, and that you owe him a thousand thanks.\\\" \\\"Apologies! to him!\\\" cried Stephane with a gesture of horror. \\\"You hesitate! oh! this is too much!  Do you then wish to revisit a certain rather gloomy hall?\\\" Stephane shuddered, his lips trembled. \\\"In mercy,\\\" cried he, \\\"inflict any other punishment upon me you please, but not that one.  Oh, no! I cannot go back to that frightful hall.  Oh! I entreat you, deprive me of my customary walks for six months; sell Soliman, cut my hair, shave my head,-- anything, yes, anything rather than put my feet in that horrible dungeon again!  I shall die there or go mad.  You don't want me to become insane?\\\" \\\"When one is unfortunate enough to believe in ghosts and apparitions at the age of sixteen,\\\" retorted the Count, \\\"he should free himself as soon as possible from the ridiculous weakness.\\\" Stephane's whole body trembled.  He staggered a few steps, and falling on his knees before his father, clung to him and cried: \\\"I am only a poor sick child, have pity on me.  You are still my father, are you not? and I am still your child?  Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!  You do not, you cannot, want your child to die!\\\" \\\"Put an end to this miserable comedy,\\\" cried the Count, disengaging himself from Stephane's clasp.  \\\"I am your father, and you are my son; no one here doubts it; but your father, sir, has a horror of scenes.  This has lasted too long; end it, I tell you.  You are already in a suitable posture.  The most difficult part is done, the rest is a trifle!\\\" \\\"What do you say, sir?\\\" answered the child impetuously, trying to rise.  \\\"I am on my knees to you only.  Ah! great God! I to kneel before this man! it is impossible! you know very well it is impossible! The Count, however, pressing his hand upon his shoulder, constrained him to remain upon his knees, and turning his face to Gilbert: \\\"I tell you, you are kneeling before the man you have insulted, and we all understand it.\\\" Was it, indeed thus, that Gilbert understood it?  Quiet, impassible, his eyes fixed upon the window, he seemed a perfect stranger to all that passed around him. A cry of anguish escaped Stephane, a frightful change came over his face.  Three times he tried to rise, and three times the hand of his father weighed him down again, and kept him in a kneeling posture.  Then, as if annihilated by the thought of his weakness and powerlessness, he yielded, and covering his eyes with both hands, he murmured these words in a stifled and convulsive voice: \\\"Sir they do me violence,--I ask pardon for hating you.\\\" And immediately his strength abandoned him, and he fainted; as a lily broken by the storm, his head sank, and he would have fallen backward, if his father had not signed to Ivan, who raised him like a feather in his robust arms, and carried him hastily out of the room. Gilbert's first care after returning to his turret, was to light a candle and burn Stephane's letter.  Then he opened a closet and began to prepare his trunk.  While engaged in this task, someone knocked at the door.  He had only time to close the closet and the trunk when Ivan appeared with a basket on his arm.  The serf came for the flowers, which he had orders to carry to the apartment of his young master.  Having placed five or six in his basket, he turned to Gilbert and gave him to understand, in his Teutonic gibberish mingled with French, that he had something important to communicate to him.  Gilbert answered in a tone of ill-humor, that he had not time to listen to him.  Ivan shook his head with a pensive air, and left.  Gilbert immediately seated himself at the table, and upon the first scrap of paper which came under his hand, hastily wrote the following lines: \\\"Poor child, do not distress yourself too much for the humiliation to which you have just submitted.  As you said yourself, you yielded only to violence, and your apologies are void in my eyes. Believe me, I exact nothing.  Why did I not divine, this morning, that Fritz spoke in your name!  I should not have felt offended, for it is not to me that your insults are addressed, it is to some strange Gilbert of your imagination.  I am not acquainted with him. But what can it avail you to provoke contests, the result of which is certain in advance?  It is a hand of iron which lately weighed upon your shoulder.  Do you hope then to free yourself so soon from its grasp?  Believe me, submit yourself to your lot, and mitigate its rigors by patience, until the day when your eyes have become strong enough to dare to look him in the face, and your hand manly enough to throw the gage of battle.  Poor child the only consolation I can offer you in your misfortune I should be a culprit to refuse.  I have but one night more to pass here; keep this secret for me for twenty-four hours, and receive the adieus of that Gilbert whom you have never known.  One day he passed near you and looked at you, and you read an offensive curiosity in his eyes. I swear to you, they were full of tears.\\\" Gilbert folded this letter, and slid it under the facing of one of his sleeves; then taking the key of the private door in his hand, and posting himself at the head of the staircase, he waited Ivan's return.  As soon as he heard the sound of his steps in the corridor, he descended rapidly and met him on the landing at the gallery. \\\"I do not know what to do,\\\" said Ivan to him.  \\\"My young master is not himself, and he has broken the first flower-pots I carried to him in a thousand pieces.\\\" \\\"Take the others too,\\\" replied Gilbert, taking care to let him see the key which he flourished in his hand.  \\\"You can put them in your room for the time being.  When he becomes calmer he will be glad to see them again.\\\" \\\"But will it not be better to leave them with you until he asks for them?\\\" \\\"I don't want to keep them half an hour longer,\\\" replied Gilbert quickly, and he descended the first steps of the private staircase. \\\"As you are going on the terrace, sir,\\\" cried the serf to him, \\\"don't forget, I beg of you, to close the door behind you.\\\" Gilbert promised this.  \\\"It works well,\\\" thought he; \\\"his caution proves to me that the wicket is not closed.\\\"  He was not mistaken. For the convenience of his transportation, the serf had left it half open, only taking the precaution to close and double-lock the door of the grand staircase.  Gilbert waited until Ivan had reached the second story, and immediately remounting upon tiptoe, he darted into the corridor, followed its entire length, turned to the right, passed before the Count's study, turned a second time to the right, found himself in the gallery which led to the square tower, sprang through the wicket, and arrived without obstacle at the foot of the tower staircase.  He found the steps littered with the debris of broken pots and flowers.  As he began to descend, loud voices came to his ears; he thought for a moment that M. Leminof was with his son.  This did not turn him from his project.  He had nothing to conceal.  \\\"I will beg the Count himself,\\\" thought he, \\\"to read my farewell letter to his son.\\\"  Having reached the top of the staircase, he crossed a vestibule and found himself in a long, dark alcove, lighted by a solitary glass door, opening into the great room ordinarily occupied by Stephane.  This door was ajar, and the strange scene which presented itself to Gilbert, as he approached, held him motionless a few steps from the threshold.  Stephane, with his back towards him, stood with his arms crossed upon his breast. He was not speaking to his father, but to two pictures of saints hanging from the wall above a lighted taper.  These two paintings on wood, in the style of Father Alexis, represented St. George and St. Sergius.  The child, looking at them with burning eyes, apostrophized them in a voice trembling with anger, at intervals stamping his foot and running his hands furiously through his long hair and tossing it in wild disorder.  Illustrious Saints of the Eastern Church, heard you ever such language before? Then he sprang on a chair, tore the two pictures from the wall, threw them to the ground, and seizing his riding whip, switched them furiously.  In this affair, St. George lost half of his head and one of his legs, and St. Sergius was disfigured for the rest of his days.  When he had satisfied his fury, Stephane hung them up again on their nails, turning their faces to the wall, and blew out the lamp; then he rolled upon the floor, twisting his arms and tearing his hair--but suddenly sitting up, he drew from his bosom a small, heart-shaped medallion which he gazed on fixedly, and as he looked the tears began to roll down his cheeks, and in the midst of his sobs, he cried out: \\\"Oh, my mother! I desire nothing from you! you could do nothing for me; but why did I have time to know you?  To remember! to remember-- what torment!  Yes, I can see you now--  Every morning you gave me a kiss, high on my forehead at the roots of my hair.  The mark is there yet--sometimes it burns me.  I have often looked in the glass to see if I had not a scar there--  Oh, my mother! come and heal my wound by renewing it!  To be kissed by one's mother, Great God! what happiness!  Oh! for a kiss, for a single kiss from you, I would brave a thousand dangers, I would give my blood, my life, my soul.  Ah! how sad you look! there are tears in your eyes.  You recognize me, do you not?  I am much changed, much changed; but I have always your look, your forehead, your mouth, your hair.\\\" Then starting up suddenly, Stephane walked around the room with an unsteady step.  He held the medallion closely grasped in his right hand and kept his eyes upon it.  Again he held it out at arm's length and looked at it steadily with half-closed eyes, or drawing it nearer to him, he said to it sweet and tender things, pressing it to his lips, kissing it a thousand times and passing it over his hair and his cheeks wet with tears; it seemed as though he were trying to make some particle of this sacred image penetrate his life and being.  At last, placing it on the bed, he knelt before it, and burying his face in his hands, cried out sobbing, \\\"Mother, mother, it is long since your daughter died.  When will you call your son to you?\\\" Gilbert retired in silence.  A voice from this room said to him: \\\"Thou art out of place here.  Take care not to meddle in the secret communion of a son and his mother.  Great sorrows have something sacred about them.  Even pity profanes them by its presence.\\\"  He descended the staircase with precaution.  When he had reached the last step,--extending his arm in the direction of the Count's room, he muttered in a low tone: \\\"You have lied!  Under that tunic of black velvet there is a beating heart!\\\"  Then advancing with a rapid step through the corridor, he hoped to pass out unseen; but on reaching the wicket, he found himself face to face with Ivan, who was coming out of his room, and who in his surprise dropped the basket he held in his hand. \\\"You here!\\\" exclaimed he in a severe tone.  \\\"Another would have paid dearly for this--\\\" Then in a soft voice, expressing profound melancholy: \\\"Brother,\\\" said he, \\\"do you want both of us to be killed?  I see you do not know the man whose orders you dare to brave.\\\"  And he added, bowing humbly: \\\"You will pardon me for calling you brother? In my mouth, that does not mean 'comrade.'\\\" Gilbert gave a sign of assent, and started to leave, but the serf, holding him by the arm, said: \\\"Fortunately the barine has gone out; but take care; two days since he had one of his turns, he has one every year, and while they last, his mind wanders at night, and his anger is terrible during the day.  I tell you there is a storm in the air, do not draw the thunderbolt upon your head.\\\" Then placing himself between Gilbert and the door, he added with a grave air: \\\"Upon your conscience, what have you been doing here?  Have you seen my young father?  Has he been talking to himself?  You could understand what he said, for he always talks in French.  He only knows enough Russian to scold me.  Tell me, what have you heard?  I must know.\\\" \\\"Don't be alarmed,\\\" answered Gilbert.  \\\"If he has secrets he has not betrayed them.  He was engaged in complaining to himself, in scolding the saints and weeping.  Neither must you think that I came hither to spy upon him, or to question him.  As he had met with sorrow, I wanted to console him by imparting the agreeable news of my near departure; but I had not the courage to show myself to him, and besides, I am not quite certain now what I shall do.\\\" \\\"Yes, you will do well to go,\\\" eagerly answered the serf; \\\"but go secretly, without warning anyone.  I will help you, if you wish it. You are too inquisitive to remain here.  Certain suspicions have already been excited on your account, which I have combated.  Then, too, you are imprudent!\\\"  Thus saying, he drew from his pocket the candle which Gilbert had dropped in the corridor, the preceding night. \\\"Fortunately,\\\" said he, returning it to him, \\\"it was I who found it, and picked it up, and I wish you well, you know why.  But before going from here,\\\" added he in a solemn tone, \\\"swear to me, that during the time you may yet remain in this house, you will not try to come into this gallery again, and that you will not ramble in the other any more in the night.  I tell you your life is in danger if you do.\\\" Gilbert answered him by a gesture of assent, and passing the wicket, regained his room, where alternately standing at the window, or stretched upon an easy-chair, he passed two full hours communing with his thoughts.  The dinner-bell put an end to his long meditations.  There was but little conversation during the repast.  M. Leminof was grave and gloomy, and seemed to be laboring under a great nervous excitement which he strove to conceal. Stephane was calmer than would have been expected, after the violent emotions he had experienced, but there was something singular in his look.  Father Alexis alone wore his everyday face; he found it very good, and did not judge it expedient to change it. Towards the end of the repast, Gilbert was surprised to see Stephane, who was in the habit of drinking only wine and water, fill his glass with Marsala three times, and swallow it almost at a single draught.  The young man was not long in feeling the effect of it; his face flushed, and his gaze became vacant.  Towards the close of the meal, he looked a great deal at the Apocalyptic frescoes of the vaulted ceiling: then turning suddenly to his father, he ventured to address him a question.  It was the first time for nearly two years,--an event which made even Father Alexis open his eyes. \\\"Is it true,\\\" asked Stephane, \\\"that living persons, supposed to be dead, have sometimes been buried?\\\" \\\"Yes, it has sometimes happened,\\\" replied the Count. \\\"But is there no way of establishing the certainty of death?\\\" \\\"Some say yes, others no.  I have been told of a frozen man who was dissected in a hospital.  The operator, in opening him, saw his heart beating in his breast; he took flight and is running yet.\\\" \\\"But when one dies a violent death--poisoned, for example?\\\" \\\"My opinion is, that they can still be mistaken.  Physiology is a great mystery.\\\" \\\"Oh! that would be horrible,\\\" said Stephane in a penetrating voice; \\\"to awaken by bruising one's forehead against the cover of a coffin.\\\" \\\"It would certainly be a very disagreeable experience, answered the Count.  And the conversation dropped.  Stephane appeared very much affected by his father's answers.  He gazed no more at the ceiling, but fixed his eyes on his plate.  His face changed color several times, and as if feeling the need of stupefying himself, he filled his glass with wine for the fourth time, but he could not empty it, and had hardly touched it with his lips before he set it on the table with an air of disgust. Tea was brought in.  M. Leminof served it; and leaving his cup to cool, rose and walked the floor.  After making two or three turns, he called Gilbert, and leaning upon his arm continued his walk, talking with him about the political news of the day.  Stephane saw them come and go; he was evidently deeply agitated.  Suddenly, at the moment when they turned their backs, he drew from his sleeve a small packet, which contained a pinch of yellow powder, and unfolding it quickly, held it over his still full cup; but as he was about emptying it, his hand trembled, and at this moment, his father and Gilbert returning to his side, he had only time to conceal the paper in his hand.  In an instant he raised it again, but at the decisive moment his courage again failed him.  It was not until the third trial that the yellow powder glided into the cup, where Stephane stirred it with his spoon.  This little scene had escaped Gilbert.  The Count alone had lost nothing of it; he had eyes at the back of his head.  He reseated himself in his place and drank his tea slowly, continuing to talk with Gilbert, and apparently quite unconscious of his son; but not a movement escaped him.  Stephane looked at his cup steadily, his agitation increased, he breathed heavily, he shuddered, and his hand trembled with feverish excitement.  After waiting several minutes, the Count turned to him and, looking him full in the eyes, said: \\\"Well! you do not drink?  Cold tea is a bad drug.\\\" The child trembled still more; his eyes had a glassy brightness. Turning his head slowly, they wandered over everything about him, the table, the chairs, the plate, and the black oak wainscoting. There are moments when the aspect of the most common objects stirs the soul with solemn emotion.  When the condemned man is led out to die, the least straw on the floor of his cell seems to say something to his heart.  Finally, gathering all his courage, Stephane raised the cup and carried it to his mouth; but before it had touched his lips, the Count took it roughly from his hands. Stephane uttered a piercing cry and fell back in his chair with closed eyes.  M. Leminof looked at him for a moment with a sarcastic and scornful smile; then bending over the cup he examined it with care, smelt of it, and dipping his spoon in it, drew out two or three yellow grains which he rubbed and pulverized between his fingers.  Then in a tone as tranquil and as indifferent as if speaking of the rain, or of the fine weather, he said: \\\"It is phosphorus, a sufficiently active poison, and phosphorus matches have been the death of a man more than once.  But I saw your little paper some time before.  If I am not mistaken the dose was not strong enough.\\\"  And dipping his finger in the cup, he passed it over his tongue, and curled his lip disdainfully.  \\\"I was not mistaken,\\\" continued he, \\\"it would only have given you a violent colic.  It was very imprudent in you; you do not like to suffer, and you know we have only fresh-water physicians in this neighborhood.  Why didn't you wait a few hours?  Doctor Vladimir Paulitch will be here to-morrow evening.\\\"  And then he went on in a more phlegmatic tone.  \\\"It should be a first principle to do thoroughly whatever you undertake to do at all.  Thus, when a man wants to kill himself according to rule, he should not begin by exciting suspicions in talking of the cemetery.  And as these affairs require the exercise of coolness, he should not try to get intoxicated.  The courage which a person finds at the bottom of a glass of Marsala is not of a good quality, and the approach of death always sobers one.  Finally, when a man has seriously resolved to kill himself, he does not do this little thing at the table, in company, but in his room, after having carefully bolted the door.  In short, your little scene has failed in every point, and you do not know the first rudiments of this fine art.  I advise you not to meddle with it any more.\\\" At these words he pulled the bell for Ivan. \\\"Your young master wanted to kill himself,\\\" said he; \\\"take him to his room and prepare him a composing draught that will put him to sleep.  Watch with him to-night, and in future be careful not to leave any phosphorus matches in his rooms.  Not that I suspect him of entertaining any intense desire of killing himself,--but who knows?  Wounded vanity might drive him to try it.  As his nerves are excited, you will see that for some days he takes a great deal of exercise.  If the weather is fine tomorrow, keep him in the open air all day, and in the evening walk him on the terrace; he must get his blood stirred up.\\\" From the moment that his father had taken the poisoned cup from him, Stephane had remained petrified on his chair, with livid face and arms hanging over his knees, giving no sign of life.  When Ivan approached to take him away, he rose with a start, and leaning upon the arm of the serf, he crossed the room without opening his eyes. When he had gone, the Count heaved a long sigh of weariness and dejection. \\\"What did I tell you?\\\" exclaimed he, throwing upon Gilbert a scrutinizing look; \\\"this boy has a theatrical turn of mind.  I would wager my life that he hadn't the faintest desire to kill himself: he only aimed at exciting us; but certainly if it was the sensitive heart of Father Alexis which he took for a target, he has lost the trouble.\\\"  And he directed Gilbert's attention to the worthy priest, who, as soon as he had emptied his cup, had fallen sound asleep on his stool, and smiled at the angels in his dreams. Gilbert gave the Count a lively and agreeable surprise by answering him in the steadiest tone: \\\"You are entirely right, sir; it was only a very ridiculous affectation.  Fortunately, we may consider it pretty certain that our young tragedian will not regale us a second time with his little play.  Where courage is required, it is good to have an opportunity of seeing to the bottom of one's sack; nothing is more likely to cure a boaster of the foolish mania for blustering.\\\" \\\"Decidedly my secretary is improving,\\\" thought the Count; \\\"he has a tender mouth and feels the curb.\\\"  And in the joy which this discovery gave him, he felt that he entertained for him sentiments of real friendship, of which he would not have believed himself capable.  His surprise and pleasure increased still more when Gilbert resumed: \\\"But apropos, sir, do you persist in\",\"timestamp\":1639708883,\"title\":\"\\nThe castle clock had struck eight, when Gilbert sprang from his bed.
