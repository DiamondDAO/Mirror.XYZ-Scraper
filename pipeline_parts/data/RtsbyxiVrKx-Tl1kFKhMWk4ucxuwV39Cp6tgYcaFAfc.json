"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hi all!  My name is Jared Lucas.  I’m a music producer and DJ-turned-Web3 enthusiast who wrote a Twitter thread that turned out to be very helpful for many of my friends:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/KapSlap/status/1446654191192002560?s=20](https://twitter.com/KapSlap/status/1446654191192002560?s=20)\\n\\nBecause of this, I have decided to create this post as a one stop shop for all of the knowledge I have accumulated about this space up to this point.  It is by no means exhaustive, but I hope it becomes a valuable resource for you to learn more about Web3.\\n\\nIdeally, if you are reading this, you may have heard of NFT’s and crypto, but do not really know why people are so excited about this technology or how to participate.\\n\\n### My goal with this post is to set you up with the knowledge, tools and direction necessary to explore what’s possible with Web3.\\n\\n*WHAT TO EXPECT HERE:*\\n\\n* An easy guide to understanding the vocabulary of Web3.\\n* Step by step onboarding into the blossoming ecosystem.\\n* Mint your **first NFT**!\\n* Become a voting member of a **DAO** (that’s a big deal!  I’ll tell you why later!)\\n\\n## What is Web3?\\n\\n![Protocol Labs, David Dias, TADSummit2018](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9BtaV_TbMxbakFPlzI-ZI.png?height=1392&width=2466)\\n\\n* Web 1: **Read** *(Publishing)* - mainly publications and businesses.  Eg. [CNN from 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/20000815052826/http://cnn.com/)\\n* Web 2: **Read, Write** *(Participation)* - social media, uploading, present day Internet\\n* Web 3: **Read, Write, Own** *([Provenance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance))* - decentralization, [interoperability](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interoperability)\\n\\nFor more reading, check the link below:\\n\\n[https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI](https://eshita.mirror.xyz/H5bNIXATsWUv_QbbEz6lckYcgAa2rhXEPDRkecOlCOI)\\n\\n## Web3 Vocabulary\\n\\n**[Crypto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) -** Short for cryptocurrency.  Secure transaction records.  An umbrella term encompassing many Web3 technologies.\\n\\n**[Blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) -** Computing primitive often secured by crypto.  Most popular cryptocurrencies use blockchains, but there are other methods ([IOTA’s Tangle](https://iota-beginners-guide.com/dlt/tangle/), [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/), etc.)\\n\\n**[Bitcoin (BTC)](https://bitcoin.org/en/) -** First blockchain cryptocurrency to get mainstream attention.  Imagine a shared Excel spreadsheet that tracks transactions, except no one company runs it.  Commonly referred to as “Digital Gold” because it takes [work](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/proof-work.asp) to mine it.\\n\\n**[Ethereum (ETH)](https://ethereum.org/en/) -** Another blockchain cryptocurrency, except this one has Smart Contracts (see below).  Imagine the same Excel sheet, but with [macros.](https://www.virginialeenlaw.com/tips/often-asked-what-are-macros-in-excel.html)\\n\\n**[Smart Contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp) -** Vending machine on the blockchain.  The code controls the execution, and transactions are trackable and irreversible.  This functionality will remove many intermediaries in the future.\\n\\n**[Gas Fees](https://carbono.com/blog/ethereum-gas-fees-explained/) -** Cost of doing a transaction on Ethereum that pays for the virtual computing power.\\n\\n**[Fiat](https://www.sofi.com/learn/content/fiat-currency/) -** Government money (USD, EUR).  Only valuable because the government says so.  Slowly being stolen from you (a.k.a. inflation).\\n\\n**[Exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/best-crypto-exchanges-5071855) -** The place you go to get crypto with fiat.\\n\\n**[Wallet](https://cryptotrader.tax/blog/best-crypto-wallet) -** The place you store your crypto.\\n\\n**[Public Key](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/public-key) -** Long string of letters and numbers that identifies your wallet on the blockchain.  You send this to people.\\n\\n**[Private Key](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/private-key) -** Long string of letters and numbers that lets you access your wallet.  You **DO NOT** send this to people.\\n\\n**[Seed phrase](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/crypto-basics/what-is-a-seed-phrase) -** 12-24 words that generate the private key.\\n\\n**[Fungible](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fungible) -** Interchangeable (grains, oil, cash).\\n\\n* **[Fungible Token](https://climatetrade.com/what-are-nfts-and-fungible-tokens/) -** BTC, ETH\\n\\n**[Non-Fungible](https://nerdschalk.com/what-does-non-fungible-mean/) -** Unique (music, art, Pokémon cards)\\n\\n* **[Non Fungible Token (NFT)](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/) -** A unique digital asset.  Examples include [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) and [Bored Ape Yacht Club](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/).\\n\\n**[Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) -** Internet communities with a shared bank account.\\n\\n**[The Metaverse](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse) -** Fuzzy term that describes the next evolution of the Internet. Digital land, avatars/items that carry over between platforms, Virtual/Augmented reality integrations, etc.\\n\\nNote: Facebook rebranded to “Meta” to pursue this vision, however it is **NOT** “The Metaverse”.  Best case scenario, they may be able to create tools for and easily onboard people into “The Metaverse”, but they will never be the entirety of the space by definition.\\n\\n## Onboarding Into Web3\\n\\nNow that you know how to talk like a pro, it’s time for the good stuff. Imagine these next steps as **“obtaining the credentials”** to be involved in almost anything Web3 related.\\n\\n*(This is **NOT** financial advice)*\\n\\n1. Use fiat to buy **1 part BTC** and **2 parts ETH** ([Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/) is a popular option).  I would budget at least a few thousand USD for step 2 if you can afford it, since gas fees are very high right now.\\n2. Create a [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) ETH wallet and transfer **1 part ETH** here.\\n   1. Download the phone app and browser extension (for browser, I'd suggest [Brave](https://brave.com/) or Chrome)\\n   2. [NEVER](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/83339/got-hacked-on-metamask-but-how) copy/paste the seed phrase of the wallet, only write it down on a physical piece of paper and put it in a safe.\\n   3. Consider beefing up security by adding a [hardware wallet](https://docs.stakewise.io/how-to/connect-metamask-to-hardware-wallets) if it is a substantial amount of funds.\\n   4. Wallets are transferrable, so if in the future you would rather use another wallet app instead of MetaMask, you can transfer your history and funds seamlessly if you have your seed phrase.\\n3. Register **{YourName}.eth** at [ENS](https://ens.domains/) and link with your MetaMask wallet.\\n4. Install [Discord](https://discord.com/) on your computer and phone.\\n5. Create a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) if you do not have one yet, as this is the main social network for the space.\\n6. Change your twitter name to **\\\"YourName.eth\\\"** in order to signal to the community that you are involved, and give people the opportunity to send things to you.\\n\\n## Mint an NFT\\n\\nOnce you have completed all of this, feel free to head back here and mint your first NFT below!  By doing this, you will be sending this NFT to your MetaMask wallet, where you will be able to see it once the transaction goes through.\\n\\nThen we’ll celebrate, because you will now own something on the blockchain that is completely yours and can never be taken away. YAY!\\n\\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=998](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=998)\\n\\nThere are a LOT of NFT marketplaces out there where you can buy and sell NFTs, but the most popular and accessible one is arguably [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/).  Create a profile there, check out how your new NFT looks and surf around!\\n\\n## Join a DAO\\n\\nHere is a tidbit from [Cooper Turley’s](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa?s=20) post called “[The DAO Landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)”\\n\\n> *A DAO is a commitment to share value with a community.*\\n>\\n> *DAOs seek to:*\\n>\\n> * *Provide members with a voice through governance.*\\n> * *Flatten hierarchy and create fluid workstreams.*\\n> * *Allocate resources to achieve a core mission.*\\n>\\n> *A Telegram group with 10 members and 1 ETH is a DAO.*\\n>\\n> *A DeFi protocol with $1B+ of assets governed on-chain by 10,000+ token holders is a DAO.*\\n>\\n> ***Regardless of size, DAOs look to solve core missions - evolving a group chat into a success-driven community.***\\n\\nDAO’s are such a big deal because they easily enable a group of people with a common purpose to band together to get things done in the real world.  Similar to companies, but different in a few key ways:\\n\\n![DAO vs Company.  Source: Aragon](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cnhKHCYtxQNNapS8bm_xs.png?height=1788&width=1744)\\n\\nFor the purpose of this educational post, I’ve set up a DAO to join to learn about what’s possible with this technology.\\n\\n### The goal of My First DAO is to be a self aware, learn-by-doing resource for people just dipping their toes into the space.  Click the link below to join:\\n\\n[https://discord.gg/FSXyYXfeVJ](https://discord.gg/FSXyYXfeVJ)\\n\\n*(Mind you, I am not a DAO expert.  If you have experience with Discord and would like to help me set up and run this, [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/KapSlap)!)*\\n\\n## Vote in the DAO\\n\\nEven more exciting is the possibility to help shape this DAOs future as a voting member.    From deploying millions of dollars to try and buy the constitution (yes, that [actually happened](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/what-is-a-dao-and-why-did-one-just-try-to-buy-the-us-constitution/ar-AAQW7UU)), to buying a shared vacation property for your friends, the possibilities here are endless. This will be necessary to understand and experience first hand if you ever want to create a DAO of your own.\\n\\n### Participate in the crowdfund below to get $MYFIRST tokens sent to your wallet, which will allow token gated access to voting proposals in the Discord!\\n\\n[crowdfund://0xBe5970115ab6ef33f6303e06602925a19f7AEc5A?version=tiered_3&network=mainnet)](crowdfund://0xBe5970115ab6ef33f6303e06602925a19f7AEc5A?version=tiered_3&network=mainnet))\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you are fully equipped to interact with Web3, head over to RabbitHole for more in depth learning - and earn more crypto in the process.  Learn to earn, baby!\\n\\n[https://rabbithole.gg/](https://rabbithole.gg/)\\n\\nHere is an incredible thread on who to follow on Twitter:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1462994664215105543?s=20](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1462994664215105543?s=20)\\n\\nAnd this is a list of some people who are thinking deeply about systems change, and some people actually doing it.  It would be nice if they intermingled a bit more, however.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/i/lists/1462826190633324550?s=20](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1462826190633324550?s=20)\\n\\nYou may also see a few abbreviations that are not familiar to you.  Here are the most common:\\n\\n**gm - good morning**\\n\\n**wagmi - we’re all gonna make it.**\\n\\nI hope this was helpful!  Whether you are here to flex on your friends, find financial freedom, create more equitable systems for society or just plain want to make more money, I wish you a hearty gm and hope you enjoy your Web3 learning experience!\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nJared\",\"timestamp\":1637696937,\"title\":\"Web3 Onboarding\"},\"digest\":\"lAsOmI49-833Hzszg3-t0Ukjx-w8IQy47h5B0JDzFJU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD2628EA414C98B6c93DE255504ab3aE050A0521E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Tqc1cn3-jeVowcRMpDN3o141pmcPMc2MMQo2zifiPJE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5dJBbBdantVQBFG5FCIu_xZu8Hpgza6OZgbp5d1XBhc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"P-dIXaulA11MHJ7enmIRMm4kzb9LNKpkZSQJq57jGV85FbdzDoSHBSKTpuGsORm_NOrh20Ndy60BdHNWK6nPlA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2592cc54d95cba765ccb4e156657b69b28f1e0cbd86a3a69219f2b9a22a28c2a5a2bdf6c6bbcb0e32ec70ab3fa5a577c296ffedc45eba39364ee40a3ed1897d21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Tqc1cn3-jeVowcRMpDN3o141pmcPMc2MMQo2zifiPJE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5dJBbBdantVQBFG5FCIu_xZu8Hpgza6OZgbp5d1XBhc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jsXyWQAqc3cXJeYGzaUBkQblTuob8FUwJMkUgfaotjw\"}"
