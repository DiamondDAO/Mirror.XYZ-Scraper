The pure product of direct democracy that many of us have thought about.\\n\\nBut there is always a downside to such large groups. People do not feel their contribution and often do not understand how to make this contribution.\\n\\nIf very much simplified, then this can be compared with the classic Ringelmann Effect.\\n\\nRingelmann conducted a simple experiment. He measured with what force a person pulls the rope when he is in teams with different numbers of people. An interesting dependency occurred.\\n\\nAs the number of members in the group increases, the average individual contribution to group work decreases.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/65tknhZwzihGaMm6j-4fA.JPG?height=1200&width=2133)\\n\\nMaybe the comparison is not very correct, but the answer is on the surface and it is logical: more participants - less contribution of each.\\n\\nAs a result, we identified 5 shortcomings of the current construction of the DAO:\\n\\n* Loss of personal responsibility for the final result\\n* Loss of coordination within a large group\\n* Decreased personal motivation\\n* Anonymity of personal contribution to the result\\n* Deindividuation (loss of personal identification of each participant)\\n\\nThe logical decision was to divide our DAO into Guilds according to their desires. To do this, we formed 4 questions, with the help of which each member of the community can form their own Guild and be a happy member of the community:\\n\\n* What would you like to do?\\n* What will be the main goal of the Guild?\\n* What role will you play in it?\\n* How can it help develop the DAO and the community around us?\\n\\nWe will collect all ideas together. The DAO will select the 5 most valuable and interesting Guilds to start.\\n\\nIn the future, the list will be expanded as the DAO desires and needs.\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to participate: [discord.gg/pawnshopgnomies](https://t.co/IqUOweFyPs)\",\"timestamp\":1642622567,\"title\":\"Introducing The Guilds of Gnomies\"},\"digest\":\"WHzXi2cQHqM6Gwyk4USsN_hM4UZRGnixfDCL0div3Fk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98d198B2735e050f291EC9B659014eE162BA5fbC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"I-UF15RJ4Swdjc8CgAam6HPDd0Vg74_DzKecvHlbTq8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RXfO1XDF0GpdEaVu4E3j_t-kPsAoYekjtIvs4wMUPHM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lhllq0ZsdpGh4XOwOyMYLko4tDwKAgtMECauGrT0T_qFx2SYiTiUtMjwVPo7C8iGssOmwssao3sv4H1yFl_npw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd3886a17bdcd529a8ea988be6e981e150482cfaa2b58f8af993a9c47117d4efc7e5d9ec7ef3385a07eaf05e552eccd499b0b3928d3a8fcde0ae6410e1f48c0621b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"I-UF15RJ4Swdjc8CgAam6HPDd0Vg74_DzKecvHlbTq8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RXfO1XDF0GpdEaVu4E3j_t-kPsAoYekjtIvs4wMUPHM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WHzXi2cQHqM6Gwyk4USsN_hM4UZRGnixfDCL0div3Fk\"}"
