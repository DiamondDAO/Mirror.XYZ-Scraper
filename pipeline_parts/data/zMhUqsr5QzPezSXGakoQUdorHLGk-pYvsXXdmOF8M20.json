"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"July 1941 Washington D.C.\\n\\nA Great War veteran, Silver Star and Purple Heart recipient. The recipient of the Medal of Honor, the Distinguished Service Cross, the Distinguished Service Medal, and the National Security Medal.\\n\\nIt was said that he, along with his surviving siblings, got from their mother, \\\"style and etiquette and the dreams of poets\\\", and from their father, \\\"toughness and duty and honor to country\\\".\\n\\nHe became a lawyer in 1909. He spent months in Berlin, in 1916, on behalf of the Rockefellers, to ask for food relief for Belgium, Serbia and Poland. Then he was called to war against Pancho Villa.\\n\\nIn the Great War, he took shrapnel in his leg, near-blinded by gas, and saved a man while under fire but refused France's Croix de Guerre because a Jewish comrade, part of the rescue, was not recognized. After the war he turned down the Medal of Honor, because he said it belonged to those who didn’t make it home.\\n\\nHis men called him \\\"Wild Bill\\\". \\\"Wild Bill\\\" Donovan, went into battle, telling men \\\"\\\"They can't hit me and they won't hit you!\\\".\\n\\nA U.S. Attorney willing to anger elites while fighting crime, who almost became U.S. Attorney General, then started a NYC law firm which prospered due to mergers needed after the ‘29 Crash.\\n\\nHe saw another global war coming because of what he did on the side. In the 1920s & 30s, Donovan travelled on intelligence trips. He became a trusted resource as part of an \\\"informal network of American businessmen and lawyers who closely tracked and collected intelligence on foreign affairs\\\".\\n\\nDespite being a critic of FDR's service as Governor of NY, FDR came to rely on and trust Donovan's insights. On July 1941, “Wild Bill” became the father of the OSS, later known as the CIA.\\n\\nDespite being a critic of FDR's service as Governor of NY, FDR came to rely on and trust Donovan's insights.

Your Uncle knew that you had to be made ready for a secret war that began before your birth. Your father, Commander Tagore, met with AL's 'father', Dr. John Cadmus, a fugitive from the Triumvirate. Cadmus and AL escaped house arrest. Years of secrets bundled in your bedtime stories - the monsters under the bed were real.”\\n\\n\\\"Director, you want us to extract the private keys for a network hidden in the DeepShips. They're 'Long War' behemoths, mothballed all over the system collecting dust. And you want us to capture one of the most powerful people in the system, the leader of the ‘Fosters’, the A.I.s, of the Triumvirate. And she happens to be \\\"family\\\" to me, Uncle AL's \\\"sister\\\", the first of Dr. Cadmus' ‘ALEP’ children. How do we get from here to there?”\\n\\nThe Director waved her hand at the table.\\n\\n\\\"Open next file. Jacob, we're gaming scenarios to find out how we don’t end the peace, at least in open, and stop the ‘Great Upload’.\\n\\nEveryone wants a new life, after the Long War. Nobody is warning them that it's a lie. Those naive enough to protest in public then disappear. The DeepShips came up in one scenario, as well the leading member of the Fosters, named ‘Alea’.\\n\\nThis means training and field operations to gather the small pieces into larger ones for the puzzle.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Director, John Cadmus, when he was alive, began fighting decades ago. The Triumvirate has power and resources.”\\n\\n\\\"This fight, this secret war, will be won or lost, because of the sacrifices of a secret network of special people who have been smart or lucky enough not to \\\"disappear\\\". You will be very busy.\\\"\\n\\nThe Director waved her hand by the table. \\\"Open mission file.\\\"\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MYPOlYiAFniyZBX6gWwlb.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7gehb0dZbfZOiNzJrsyE3.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633897594,\"title\":\"1961: 5.13 An Informal Network of Secrets, 2912\"},\"digest\":\"Gdss5eScmGs_P7LQBxw-9ukHvqU4rR7LN-TTWFY0Yms\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"G4s_bEP4og7ajV5q0-pU2pEhdStgdxdXSXz3mEOpF1v0qRgnEf6misW0_QDqDmXo2zqC8pwxF_OKpHSwCTbv4Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Gdss5eScmGs_P7LQBxw-9ukHvqU4rR7LN-TTWFY0Yms\"}"
