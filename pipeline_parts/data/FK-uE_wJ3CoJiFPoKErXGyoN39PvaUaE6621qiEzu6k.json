"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Solana (SOL) bounced considerably on Dec 4, preventing a breakdown from the current bullish structure.\\n\\nSOL has been falling since reaching an all-time high price of $259.9 on Nov 6. The decrease continued until a low of $169 was reached on Dec 4.Â \\n\\nDuring the descent, SOL broke down from an ascending support line that had previously been in place since Sept 22. Therefore, the breakdown suggests that this portion of the upward movement is complete. Furthermore, the token validated the line as resistance on Dec 9.\\n\\nHowever, after breaking down, SOL bounced at the $170 support on Dec 4. This is both a horizontal support area and the 0.618 Fib retracement support level when measuring the upward movement.\\n\\nThis is a very crucial support area that could initiate numerous short-term bounces. As long as SOL is trading above it, the price action can still be considered bullish, despite the breakdown from the support line.\",\"timestamp\":1639036153,\"title\":\"Solana (SOL) Attempts Bullish Reversal at $170\"},\"digest\":\"rZX2GmezviJAhfl8canoaclF4emjDayJNv1ltniVqn0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x15544da0Aeb27fC75cE4410e0D188e416a7b653b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"urztuO-rdMO3O766qG1S9kXSBrxZK_Wr00eO34JyZdk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"507adaV2yNOosoKSthU5f6DHWWN3BrdhbD5PiyQKEvc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cfWqt1diow8WKImlAZqAwZgludmEYPeN08i8w85t_IZCrK-vgXw4Utst6iLjhnnP8OFoAv0EiH3EhTYIjDNjbA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x053c0d35771ee24df833a105ffa21f4c5091d7d6e90fbd38fdb8745c8e8a40944da1cb0e52dba0dbc1b104df11c93e2bb32c8afc3e348df68776b95ef501cf111b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"urztuO-rdMO3O766qG1S9kXSBrxZK_Wr00eO34JyZdk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"507adaV2yNOosoKSthU5f6DHWWN3BrdhbD5PiyQKEvc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rZX2GmezviJAhfl8canoaclF4emjDayJNv1ltniVqn0\"}"
