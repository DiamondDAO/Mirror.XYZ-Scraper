With its foundation being the blockchain and  applications such as non-fungible tokens (NFTs), 2021 has seen a surge in new projects that take advantage of such technology and catalyze its usage and subsequently its impact and reach.  \\n\\n### Background\\n\\nI will be utilizing one specific project that I happen to be part of and love dearly. The [Non-Fungible Olive Garden](https://nonfungibleolivegardens.com/) (NFOG) project started in December of 2021 with the simple idea of producing NFTs of Olive Garden franchise locations on the blockchain. There are 880 NFOG franchise NFTs and accompanied by another set of NFTs based on the breadsticks that are famously offered by Olive Garden, and it true fashion, there is no limit to the supply of breadstick NFTs, if you are interested in owning a breadstick NFT, you can mint one on the [NFOG website](https://nonfungibleolivegardens.com/). \\n\\nOn December 29th, 2021, Darden, the parent company that holds the Olive Garden company issued a take down request to OpenSea, the platform that allows individuals to browse and purchase NFTs. On December 30th, 2021, OpenSea removed the NFOG collections off of their platform but the blockchain is not tied to any given platform, the owners of the NFOG NFTs have retained their assets and other platforms such as \\n\\nThe statement issued by Darden and the response sent by the NFOG core team can be found in this tweet: \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/NFOGtweets/status/1476742404631789571?s=20](https://twitter.com/NFOGtweets/status/1476742404631789571?s=20)\\n\\n### Implications \\n\\nWe could neglect this whole scenario all together and dismiss it as a simple meme project that eventually faced the inevitable shutdown that any other project of similar background and agenda would face. While that is certainly true, I believe there is an interesting take and learning that we can derive from this situation. There are multiple avenues we can dive deeper into and project trends, impact and importance of such event has on the cross-section and flow from web2 to web3. I will only focus on the link between corporations and web3 for this blog.  \\n\\n### Conclusion \\n\\nCorporations that fail to embrace the memes, community of fans and free publicity that these web3 projects offer will eventually find themselves losing out on a massive opportunity to leverage such community or project and build a foothold into the web3 revolution. While web3 is providing creators with the opportunity to own their content and not fear the dependency on centralized platforms to extend their reach, corporations also have the ability to utilize the communities and meme projects that spur up, providing them with additional support or partnerships to extend their reach which results in additional business and revenue for said corporation. \\n\\nI will note that there are instances where there might be a project that is built upon the malicious intent to harm a company and destroy its reputation. That topic lends itself to a separate discussion but irregardless of the intent of such project or organization, it would be a wise move by the corporations to find ways to leverage the use of these projects and establish their foundation in the web3 era. \",\"timestamp\":1640929937,\"title\":\"Web3, Corporations, and Memes\"},\"digest\":\"9rmi_FYgYpW4v_UqAlPRScns5Z-87uQCCBpXzRrMbgU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd269259ed7Fa5d3B04a114DA788744E72540Ba01\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"S5p-tIfEmVxQQAMG2FOCc2CATJWC1olkAHNlg5DBApI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cY94ZxK0ccS82KgCdD3LFXaEW0_noPl6jYQ6QNYL9do\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2hRA4--PwK7MWmvjTig86fDt00z2owk_qEAm60aeG2v64RMBuyW336vEWKxYwT_7Neeiq_wJpHVwXo8_EpNz9w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x90ebcf20d79a6d0be1ed521dc729ff9d4bb295866ebafb7c6119307613583d2c081bf334d7b90ad31faeb4d062e87d882cad70f4a874c97898ab82a44faa2c3a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"S5p-tIfEmVxQQAMG2FOCc2CATJWC1olkAHNlg5DBApI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cY94ZxK0ccS82KgCdD3LFXaEW0_noPl6jYQ6QNYL9do\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"9rmi_FYgYpW4v_UqAlPRScns5Z-87uQCCBpXzRrMbgU\"}"
