"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I became a dev because of the quarantine, it is actually kind of funny how today I see my code from almost two years ago and I say … Fuck I’ve learned a lot, and it’s not only the fact that I’ve get some skills in programming, but also now I see life as a whole new thing. So today’s article is about how can programming can save your life.\\n\\n### Programming as a life changer:\\n\\nWell, when I was a kid, I used to love amazing hacking groups, such as Anonymus, CozyBear etc, I learned actually some programming but only the basics. The last year for some reason, I started to watch some Udemy courses about JavaScript in games, so It all started for me, I learnt how to program a classic, Tetris. The course was completely beginner friendly, so I was actually amazed on how well everything was explained to me, even tho I had some previous experience. So I tried to apply everything to real life, starting from making more logical decisions and it actually worked. and then I read an amazing phrase that inspired me “Connecting the dots“. \\n\\n### The follow up\\n\\nWell, after all I decided to keep it going with my learning path, I got some jobs as a freelancer and It went pretty well I’m glad to say. I kept learning about JS frameworks and also some backend technologies.\\n\\n### The Plan\\n\\nMy actual plan is to continue growing as a developer, having fun in the process and hopefully one day I can make it to any amazing big tech company.\\n\\nThanks for reading. Hope you liked it.\\n\\n\\\\-Juan Romero\",\"timestamp\":1640746798,\"title\":\"How Programming can save you.\"},\"digest\":\"y91mcbD3bUcO-JWAW3b_erE0x4OSVxpLbFdUA_kRVBo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xAFb1A2903CA46f6CF40F5765573e5bFa37dD9afE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"14nzJm7a851dHK1c5HU3bo40IDHTVfJxskgbtGojwDA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MfiDx79sdVYKlbMWwk6APWFdzeUCOVyZ0PrhX_kLELg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bDS1euTkSWC2S5mcLNNiAqvEzlefVwekFL6Hk7MbIG9ETA5i7BKi8RPyzOtmbndqhhoOTlKrWU_nTvlcrjO7MQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xae533f85171fb990f6845e569b58059df00fc8056e63f6b1f45176792ef5bac656f9e1f8a9a847d0d52c53f3b19c0111be40e27b3e4bfb8cc35a1e5a8cc714c71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"14nzJm7a851dHK1c5HU3bo40IDHTVfJxskgbtGojwDA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MfiDx79sdVYKlbMWwk6APWFdzeUCOVyZ0PrhX_kLELg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"29bYFX52ny-L-CVdp_I8eedLfsrZn1B_pZ54nIzJ4F0\"}"
