"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"So since last time I did not actually write an hour a day or at all to be honest but this time I am determined to put more effort in. \\n\\nLots has changed for me, recently I went to India, nearly got arrested and learnt a lot on the way. This is a story I will come back to for learning purposes at some point in the future. Right now I would like to discuss free-will.\\n\\nThis week I started working for the Austrian state for less than minimum wage in a position I am overqualified for and which I do not want to do. Why? Because the only other alternative is joining the army. This is a modern example of forced labour, one where what we hold so dear, our “free-will” is taken away from us. Another example would be prison or to some extent most kinds of jobs.\\n\\nAn important point here is that we only possess limited free-will as we are ultimately always limited in some way or the other. Whether it is psychically such as the biological fact than men cannot have children, mentally as in “self-limiting beliefs” or even economically as in the need to work or gain income in order to survive. \\n\\nMy personal ultimate goal is to be liberated, free from all constraints and most people would agree that that sounds cool, nice and fun. The path towards it though is everything but that. Although usually a gained freedom is very hard to take away. Once you grow up and learn to dress yourself it is rare that your parents decide they want to dress you again as they did when you were a kid. This is a liberty that once gained remains and most do. Once you leave school you are never subject to learning things you are not interested in anymore. \\n\\nSo it makes sense that we retaliate against lost freedoms the strongest, hence why prison works as a major deterrent for crime. Nobody wants to lose the independence they have worked so hard to gain. I feel that I am in the same situation, after completing my studies which were a very liberal affair in a very liberal country I am forced to work not for money not for some greater ideal not for any real reason really except tradition. A tradition that most countries have broken with. \\n\\nIt is such a disappointing feeling to have to slow down personal progress, I felt like I was on an exciting path towards more liberation and then this major setback forces me to accept the fact that some decision made by some people many years back can limit me in such a major way. \\n\\nYet resignation is not the same as acceptance, one must accept facts as they are but seek the “right” path. Mine is fighting the power by explaining to a professional how this “duty” is destroying me and to hope she will understand and either put an end to this fiasco or at least temporarily liberate me. What is yours?\",\"timestamp\":1639477020,\"title\":\"forced labour\"},\"digest\":\"zmGt5-SldDgTzhpTClazL3HxWUuJQxo4AkC7SuSo_wc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcC1Fa03e8172B22B90a68615872F47D3B703A610\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kyxWuTgzv6dRYhrJYTKnZj3rUIdeqREjn6CpDsf2x2GNQfagUDkoRshRN-h97YJduCdKN_ZcejKbwXY3fk22Bw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x604ab1fb886724196c480c557c059bad0a71cc5d1af0bd5421202517fc744bd96d893a7212cc12082dbde2685be15114ba162a8c9742cf9a71a0be9568d930751b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zmGt5-SldDgTzhpTClazL3HxWUuJQxo4AkC7SuSo_wc\"}"
