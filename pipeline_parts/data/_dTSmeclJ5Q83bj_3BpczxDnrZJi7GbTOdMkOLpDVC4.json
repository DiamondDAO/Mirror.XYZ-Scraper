"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Radicle is an open source and community-led project. One priority of the project is to support the development and growth of collective community infrastructure that can be employed to [further decentralize the project](https://radicle.community/t/the-path-to-increasing-decentralization-within-radicle/2417).\\n\\n‚ÄúCommunity infrastructure‚Äù includes the project‚Äôs content hubs. While [radicle.community](https://radicle.community/) is the official forum for discussions related to Radicle development & governance, our [website blog](https://radicle.xyz/blog/https://radicle.xyz/blog/) is also used to distribute project-wide content and announcements.\\n\\nAs the project grows, Radicle‚Äôs community team sees a need to create more accessible channels for content contributions from the Radicle community. We believe that as an open source project, not only should anybody be able to contribute blog posts, onboarding guides, tutorials, and other content.\\n\\n## Mirror ‚úçÔ∏è + Radicle Orgs üé™\\n\\nToday, we launched [radicle.mirror.xyz](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/), a community blog for the Radicle project. Anybody is free to submit content to be published to the blog as long as it meets the following guidelines:\\n\\n* **Must be Radicle relevant** üå± \\\\\\\\n Content must be related to Radicle in some shape or form. Onboarding guides, tutorials, partnership announcements, and industry-specific thought pieces are all fair game.\\n* **Must pass official review by Radicle Community maintainers** üëÄ \\\\\\\\n At the moment, Prema Tsamy & Abbey Titcomb are the maintainers of radicle.mirror.xyz and conduct formal review of all submissions.\\n\\nWith Mirror and Radicle Orgs, we‚Äôre decentralizing the ownership, management, and collaboration of the community blog.\\n\\n### Dogfooding üê∂ü¶¥\\n\\nRecently, we launched [Radicle Orgs](https://radicle.xyz/blog/radicle-orgs.html), a decentralized code management tool for DAOs. Radicle Orgs are a platform-agnostic, and more secure alternative to organizations on centralized forges like GitHub and Gitlab. Relying on smart contracts instead of admins, they allow developers manage and anchor their codebases on-chain. Radicle Orgs give DAOs a way to truly decentralize & own their collaboration infrastructure without relying centralized accounts & platforms.\\n\\n[https://radicle.mirror.xyz/LC1gmqihYDbxGi_kWqm6Em7Gou1F1WzG_cjkdsrSSpo](https://radicle.mirror.xyz/LC1gmqihYDbxGi_kWqm6Em7Gou1F1WzG_cjkdsrSSpo)\\n\\nAfter deciding to launch a community blog, we decided this could be a great opportunity to dogfood Radicle Orgs. While Radicle Orgs are a perfect solution for codebases, they can easily be used to decentralize management of any version-controlled repository. At Radicle, our [website blog](https://radicle.xyz/blog/) was already version-controlled and [hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/radicle-dev/radicle.xyz).\\n\\nWe created an org for the [Community Team](https://app.radicle.network/orgs/community.radicle.eth) and [a repository](https://app.radicle.network/orgs/community.radicle.eth/projects/rad:git:hnrkxcktftwxbk9yshjgspqqyxnye1phzjz7y/e05dd68ad4e475a8582ddede52ee76c3d2218b9e) for managing content submissions. Ownership of the radicle.mirror.xyz domain will be transferred to the Gnosis Safe that owns the Radicle Org as soon as Mirror offers multi-sig support. For now, ownership of the publication will be controlled by the lead maintainer.\\n\\n### Contributing\\n\\nContributors can submit a post for review by [creating and publishing a patch](https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/using-radicle/creating-patches) to the radicle.mirror.xyz repository on Radicle. Contributors can [clone the repository](https://app.radicle.network/orgs/community.radicle.eth/projects/rad:git:hnrkxcktftwxbk9yshjgspqqyxnye1phzjz7y/e05dd68ad4e475a8582ddede52ee76c3d2218b9e) on app.radicle.network.\\n\\nOnce the patch is reviewed, maintainers will either merge the post or request changes. Once merged, the repository will be [anchored on-chain](https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/connecting-to-ethereum/anchoring-projects) and published promptly to radicle.mirror.network.\\n\\nAs the blog continues to grow, we can explore automating the publishing process, distributing ownership among the community, and rewarding contributors (*cough* Radicle Funding *cough* ü§≠). Let the dogfooding begin!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Join our Discord üëæ\\n\\n[https://discord.com/invite/fUK5BGtyTR](https://discord.com/invite/fUK5BGtyTR)\\n\\n### Get started with Radicle üå±\\n\\n[https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/connecting-to-ethereum/overview](https://docs.radicle.xyz/docs/connecting-to-ethereum/overview)\\n\\n### Follow us on Twitter üê•\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/radicle?lang=en](https://twitter.com/radicle?lang=en)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1632777276,\"title\":\"Introducing the Radicle Community Blog üå±\",\"publication\":\"radicle\"},\"digest\":\"i6InVN5BGbIwe2XQ6BUycNNbnlO7J7AnDmTyRP4FQkw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7BCf7A112e9fC7Ff2b54a52990976E5C3352F2D2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vT2z0Wwia8BWomjSHA5gTd8XuREGHio15OEjpIhU5_Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zKwUcTnqFydocfUfQaOjRMA32b2E83xsQ9CIwRBvDn0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"i3gPttNJcpep2mWQkPVFMdpGuAqph6rFvMVffmy4pmec1r_GRNr0-wq3aI17GxM94CA8Wf9JtuMOw092DI3tvQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x442d8186f415b43c72c43169b5edcc62c541c44b787a2da03a4604c150c83b4e1d603ef09911669621905a19cd66879b254797d5dbc91ef6ac0377538b7d04d11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on radicle.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vT2z0Wwia8BWomjSHA5gTd8XuREGHio15OEjpIhU5_Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zKwUcTnqFydocfUfQaOjRMA32b2E83xsQ9CIwRBvDn0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ya_vG_FlGpIa4RWE2g0rtaSrrTvnOfANs35Rj5P9vGo\"}"
