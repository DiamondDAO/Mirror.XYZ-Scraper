I was a style advisor for a while, but I had always been more interested in crafting and making things, so I started making and selling wire wrapped crystal jewelry on the side and knew I wanted a career where I would have a lot of creative freedom.\\n\\nI first found out about digital fashion around 2 years ago when I read that The Fabricant sold the first digital garment on auction for $9000. The industry was so fresh, I knew then that I needed to know more. I went on their website and looked at the job opportunities they had listed and found the softwares I had to learn, and from there I learned Clo3D.\\n\\nI started to develop digital fashion assets for brands and designers, each with their own reason and use case for the technology. Some wanted it mainly for promotional reasons; others wanted to test out garments before physically making them. But I knew that more could be done with the 3D models I was making and with the digital fashion industry as a whole. It was at that point that I was introduced to the GDN. I truly have found my tribe here. Even though we are all separated by distance and screens, we are connected in a way that transcends those limitations. We're building out not only an entirely new industry, but a new way of connecting,  collaborating and doing business with each other; a way that's cemented in supporting one another rather than competing. Competition is still there, but in more of a collaborative and open way that allows anyone to compete, regardless of background. Equal opportunities for everyone.\\n\\nI see digital fashion being the norm in the future and I'm extremely grateful to be helping to pioneer the industry in that direction in a more decentralised way through web3 fashion and NFT's. I have plans to grow into a business that can encapsulate all areas of digital/web3 fashion, to help traditional fashion brands transition more easily into the space, with the right advice and guidance. I also have plans to incorporate physical design, e.g. the jewelry I make into web3fashion, so that if you buy the NFT you get a one-off physical piece and also use cases within the metaverse and DeFi staking your digital version NFT on DIGITALAX for $MONA yield. I understand the value NFT technology could have in the future. That's what makes me so passionate about this side of the industry. In the end, I want all of my NFT holders to benefit from my success. Ideally I would like them to be the ones that fund my plans and ideas by buying my NFT's, rather than a centralised bank or organisation.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Web3 Renaissance Patronage\\n\\nAny patronage of the Weekly Designer Spotlight goes directly to the Global Designer Network Treasury, Spotlighted Designer and Core Writer (50/35/15), for further growing out the infrastructure, community and market of web3 fashion, the open metaverse and more.
