New York City continues to be the hardest hit area. The New York City healthcare system has been exhausted by the onslaught of COVID-19 cases and over the last two weeks healthcare workers have come forward to describe a hellish landscape within New York City hospitals.\\n\\nAt the prestigious NYU Langone Medical Center, staff have reported an alarming disregard for healthcare worker safety amidst the emergence of the pandemic.\\n\\nBy March, NYU Langone had begun designating certain floors within the hospital confirmed COVID areas. Healthcare workers have claimed that staff manning these areas were not made aware that they were working designated COVID floors or that the hospital had already seen several confirmed cases of the virus. Staff reported learning of confirmed cases through media reports.\\n\\nIn another troubling statement, healthcare workers have also claimed that by mid-March they were being instructed not to bag, or provide pressure ventilation, for patients that had gone into respiratory distress for fear of accelerating the spread of the virus.\\n\\n“I was a little bit surprised when I heard that because it was pretty early on in this whole thing and I thought it was a little bit too extreme for where we were at the time. And, I think that it just shows that we don’t have the proper equipment because in any other case we would definitely continue to bag and fight for the person’s life until we could get them supported on a ventilator. I think it’s something that we’re probably going to be seeing a lot of more of where we’re really having to choose who dies and who lives,” says a healthcare worker with the hospital speaking on conditions of anonymity after warnings that job security could be jeopardized for any staff speaking to the press without prior approval.\\n\\nAs has become commonplace in many hospitals within the US and other highly impacted regions around the world, healthcare workers at NYU Langone have been operating without the necessary PPE, or personal protective equipment, due to state and nation-wide shortages. And, on Sunday, April 5th, the Associated Press reported that the White House waited until mid-March to begin placing orders for desperately needed supplies like N95 masks and ventilators. These supplies are not required to be delivered until the end of April after New York is expected to reach its peak number of cases.\\n\\nFacing looming shortages of PPE, staff have claimed that as late as Wednesday, March 19th, when cases in the US had reached 13,133 and deaths attributed to COVID-19 had surged to a total of 195, healthcare workers were forbidden from bringing in N95 masks from their personal stores.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8sNsceSZZfusUox4K6mez.png?height=1016&width=1400)\\n\\n“We’re almost acting like the military and it’s in some small way like what we signed up for, but we signed up knowing that we would be able to help people and be protected. OSHA was created for a reason, JCAHO is there for a reason, but when push comes to shove, they’re not really doing anything. It’s like they created rules and then decided to go cowboy on us.”\\n\\nMedical personnel have asserted that this policy forced healthcare workers to reuse their protective N95 masks as hospital supplies dwindled. N95 masks are designed to be worn once during the care of one patient and then discarded. This prevents microbes from traveling from one patient to another or to healthcare workers in the vicinity.\\n\\nWhile this restriction has now been lifted, it remains to be seen what impact this will have on reported cases of COVID-19 amongst staff as the nation trudges reluctantly into what Surgeon General Jerome Adams has said may be “the hardest moment for many Americans in their entire lives,” on Sunday’s edition of Meet the Press.\\n\\n“Unless you’re deathly ill, they say come to work unless you can’t breathe. Breathing with an N95 mask is already difficult, it feels like you’re suffocating for 12 hours straight.”\\n\\nThose who display symptoms of COVID-19, or have received confirmation of the virus, may be required to continue working the COVID designated floors. “Patients are being intubated left and right, nurses are working until they drop, the hospital is going to kill them,” says another healthcare worker with the hospital. “I can’t even imagine what life is going to be like for these nurses when this is all over, after they’ve seen all these people die. There are going to be serious mental health consequences.”\\n\\nAnd already, we’re beginning to see the toll these conditions have taken on healthcare workers in Italy with reports of two nurses working with COVID-19 populations committing suicide in as many weeks. 66 Italian health workers have died since the pandemic began.\\n\\n“I have seven really close friends from nursing school, and as of now, four of them are confirmed positive for having COVID. This is not just a New York problem, we’re just the first one with the big hit. I have a lot of friends who go home and all they can do during their days off is sit on the couch and just watch TV and try to forget about it before going back to work. The problem with this is there’s a lot of young nurses at our hospital and this is their first nursing job. To deal with this in your first year of nursing is really traumatizing. And, I worry that for them, and for the future of our profession, it’s going to be really hard to get the workforce back together, to want to continue to be nurses. If you give us time to heal, we can fix the workforce; if you give us time to stay at home, we can better take care of our patients.”\\n\\nFollowing these interviews, one of the healthcare professionals quoted above reported testing positive for COVID-19 after experiencing mild symptoms. As plasma from recovered patients is expected to play a large role in formulating treatments for COVID-19, they’re hoping to donate plasma following their recovery.\\n\\nNYU Langone Medical Center has declined to comment.\\n\\nOriginally published on April 7, 2020 and featured on Medium’s Coronavirus and Health pages.\",\"timestamp\":1637082389,\"title\":\"“Patients are being intubated left and right, nurses are going to work until they drop, the hospital is going to kill them.”\"},\"digest\":\"K1ZWRAgq0_FcwbE8fA9HdWifXNYLQFY2fp0xxd3dAAw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x59B3869e43cF8B31EDB1d9303F31240b61A40710\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2vcc9KX7O1GyXWk3P48ILCBdfAUVx72gPo1dP24_8xU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rPw78axJlXw-fV464JF1VG_DLz08x8N6B817uzWPquQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qTXmU9S7m6TCO5AA1Xh03dL3HJdrzMeWsRpnMWIE3zOTI0tVWuGm7Gv09IrLaKd-65S3lgQCzNo8xY6r5h7rKw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1153e409a2d793e83378d0966c8c191bc94481be0821834e504d96fc8225881a46290f872c658066e8c0664efe04267aa0b9f37df50cf74bf0f659cabaf2e8ce1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2vcc9KX7O1GyXWk3P48ILCBdfAUVx72gPo1dP24_8xU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rPw78axJlXw-fV464JF1VG_DLz08x8N6B817uzWPquQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"K1ZWRAgq0_FcwbE8fA9HdWifXNYLQFY2fp0xxd3dAAw\"}"
