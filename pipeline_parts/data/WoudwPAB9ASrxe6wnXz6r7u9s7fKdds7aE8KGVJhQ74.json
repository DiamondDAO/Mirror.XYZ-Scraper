That’s a really great way to get entangled in extremely heated online fights – and wouldn’t you know it, Dorsey’s aggressive [dismissal of Web 3](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/21/bitcoin-will-replace-the-dollar-jack-dorsey/) as nothing more than a venture capitalist (VC) enrichment scheme has turned into a vicious airing of grievances, just in time for [Festivus](https://festivusweb.com/festivus-airing-of-grievances.php).\\n\\n自从正式离开 Twitter 以来，现在全职 做Block（前 Square）首席执行官 Jack Dorsey 对区块链和加密货币的辩论变得更加直言不讳和固执己见。这是陷入极度激烈的网络撕逼的绝佳方式——你难道不知道吗，多尔西 Jack Dorsey  激进的diss Web3成了VC的赚钱工具，双方的论战成了[Festivus](https://festivusweb.com/festivus-airing-of-grievances.php)及时的谈资。\\n\\nBut many new entrants who have become interested in crypto over the past two years are left scratching their heads. Web 3 is about blockchain, somehow, right? And Bitcoin is a blockchain – so why are Mom and Dad fighting?\\n\\n这两年新进入的人群会丈二和尚摸不着头脑，Web3是区块链，比特币是区块链\\n\\nWell, young ‘un, therein lies the long tale of a great feud.

The Dorsey blowup is a high-profile eruption of a fight that has been raging pretty much constantly since 2013, if not earlier, and has really heated up since the [2014 unveiling](https://fortune.com/2014/01/28/cash-menagerie-inside-the-bitcoin-confab/) of Ethereum.\\n\\n我们将讨论为什么 Dorsey 认为 VC 控制 Web 3 的问题，说到底其实还是从2014年ETH 登场\\n\\nOn one side of this debate is a loose alliance sometimes confusingly referred to by insiders like Dorsey as “crypto,” but which might be more accurately dubbed “Ethereans” – not because they all use or build on Ethereum specifically, but because basically all of these systems broadly mimic or parallel what Ethereum does. These are the folks behind the recent explosion in innovations like decentralized finance ([DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/)), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), play-to-earn gaming, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) – and very notably, decentralized social media, which Twitter began working on [when Dorsey was CEO](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/16/twitter-picks-crypto-developer-jay-graber-to-run-decentralized-social-media-wing/).\\n\\n上一轮可能是比特币分叉大战，虽然ETH也因ICO火起来了，但是也因为ICO项目的垃圾和项目方的抛盘，ETH差点陷入深渊。\\n\\n但这论牛市Defi的异军突起、NFT的接棒，到最近GameFi、DAO，都是基于ETH和其他主链，这个才引起ETH会不会超越BTC的问题成为争论点。\\n\\nThese applications largely rely on “smart contracts,” lines of code that live on blockchains and set the terms for transparent, irreversible and open-access transactions. As part of these structures, smart contract-based projects often require their own unique token to use, and these make up a large portion of the crypto market on exchanges like Coinbase. “Web 3″ is, very roughly, the idea that the web should integrate more smart contract applications, and their various tokens. NFTs aren’t inherently reliant on smart contracts, but they’ve become deeply enmeshed in this ecosystem, and they’re now a large part of the pitch for both Web 3 and the [metaverse](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/08/03/a-crypto-guide-to-the-metaverse/).\\n\\n这些应用都是基于智能合约，应该这些代币占了CEX和DEX大部分份额了。\\n\\nAnd yes, Web 3 and the metaverse are structurally synonymous. Both at their core are about building front-end interfaces and systems that use blockchain assets, which can be shared across a variety of these front ends. That includes things like having NFT-based game assets usable in a variety of games, or tokens that unlock a variety of services.\\n\\nWeb3和元宇宙也是类似。\\n\\n(This is what makes Facebook rebranding itself Meta and claiming to build “the metaverse” such terminal, drooling idiocy, if not an act of outright malice. It’s just as comically thickskulled as a company claiming to build “the blockchain.” I mean, it’s right there in the name: “Meta,” derived from Greek, means [“beyond” or “transcending,”](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/meta-meaning) in this case as in “transcending any single iteration of a virtual world.” Interoperability is inherent to the metaverse, and what Facebook is building will be at best be a shard of something much larger – though knowing Facebook, it will much more likely be a walled garden that smears on just enough metaverse-colored greasepaint to hustle the rubes.)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A1xrA_XTrjkMla5obyyQ-.jpeg?height=339&width=512)\\n\\n## Bitcoin bites back\\n\\nOn the other side of this Stalin versus Trotsky barroom brawl are Bitcoiners like Dorsey. This loose but passionate faction believes that the original cryptocurrency is also the best cryptocurrency, or maybe even the only legitimate one. The most extreme Bitcoiners are known as “Bitcoin Maximalists,” and they essentially believe that Bitcoin’s sturdiness and universality will make it a shared global currency, with democratized access benefiting humanity as a whole.\\n\\nMaximalists (though not all Bitcoiners) also believe that other cryptos are a threat to that vision (“an attack on Bitcoin,” as they often put it), primarily because of their compromises on decentralization. Some Maximalists feel that opposing other cryptos justifies, let’s say, a [wide diversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diversity_of_tactics) of rhetorical tactics. Their willingness to go for the figurative throat has often led to Bitcoiners being tarred as “toxic,” probably one reason the backlash to Dorsey’s comments has itself been so heated.\\n\\nWhile advocates are still working to define the precise benefits of “Web 3,” Bitcoiners have concise bullet points for the benefits of truly decentralized cryptocurrencies: extreme data security (you can’t hack the Bitcoin network), censorship resistance (anyone can use Bitcoin and nobody can stop any transaction by technical means), privacy (though not necessarily secrecy), and trustlessness. Trustlessness means that the system abides by reliable and transparent rules that no individual, entity or small consortium can change unilaterally. With Bitcoin, any changes require [genuine mass consensus](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/who-sets-the-rules-of-bitcoin-as-nation-states-and-corps-roll-in/) among developers, miners and nodes (though bitcoin holders basically have no say, apart from selling if they don’t like the way things are going).\\n\\nThe prerequisite for all those nice things is the core feature that Bitcoiners argue defines a “real” blockchain: true and full decentralization. This is a crucial distinction: Decentralization isn’t in and of itself a virtue or a goal; it’s a thing you must have to get the features unique to public blockchains. That also means, somewhat confusingly, that there are a handful of other truly decentralized cryptos that even the most hardened Maximalists can at the very least tolerate. One example is Monero, a privacy token that has one of the wildest [community-driven origin stories](https://medium.com/@favakrypt/the-long-fork-story-of-monero-xmr-cryptonote-code-forks-chain-splits-and-network-upgrades-bc5250b4db5) ever.\\n\\nThe test case for the importance of decentralization is pretty simple: If a very powerful government wanted to shut down or interfere with a particular blockchain, how many people or machines would they have to compromise to do it?\\n\\nBitcoiners look at Ethereum-style “crypto” and smart contracts and see tradeoffs in decentralization and security for the sake of throughput or features – what is sometimes derided as [“decentralization theater.”](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/19/gary-gensler-isnt-buying-your-decentralization-theater/) This is largely targeted at [proof-of-stake](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2020/12/30/what-is-proof-of-stake/) and other alternative [consensus mechanisms](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2017/03/04/a-short-guide-to-blockchain-consensus-protocols/), but even Ethereum itself, in its current proof-of-work iteration, gets knocked on this point: Bitcoiners argue that its structure makes independent nodes onerous to create and maintain, increasing centralization and fragility.\\n\\nThough it didn’t directly involve smart contracts, the same argument was central to the [“Block Size War”](https://www.amazon.com/Blocksize-War-Control-Bitcoins-Protocol/dp/B096CLR1SS) of 2015-2017, when a faction seeking faster transactions proposed making Bitcoin nodes similarly hefty. That battle also cemented another major Bitcoiner argument: that a diversity of cryptocurrencies, even those that are technologically similar to Bitcoin itself, threatens the growth of the crypto ecosystem because it splinters interest into a variety of factions. Some moderate Bitcoiners reject this critique, though, arguing that so-called “altcoins” can be useful test beds for future Bitcoin features.\\n\\nBut basically all Bitcoiners are extremely skeptical of the involvement of for-profit entities in creating new tokens, arguing in part that such a role inherently compromises the decentralization of systems because there’s either a centralized entity able to make their own changes to the system, or a clear target for government pressure to censor a system. See for example the stablecoins USDT and USDC, whose administrators, Tether and Circle respectively, have the power to block any blacklisted user, or seize their funds. (You can see for yourself on the blockchain, [here](https://bloxy.info/txs/calls_sc/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7?signature_id=37757) and [here](https://bloxy.info/txs/calls_sc/0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48?signature_id=4352).)\\n\\nDorsey’s critique of VCs’ role in Web 3 is focused on the financial implications of VC-backed blockchains, arguing that they inevitably siphon money away from users and basically wind up as landlords on their own systems. But that argument is somewhat downstream from the centralization critique.\\n\\n毫无疑问，比特币才是最去中心化的，所以比特币在SOV这块的地位不可撼动，比特币已经成了资产，其他Token很难承担其左右，ETH可能在资产方面勉强及格了。\\n\\n## Who actually needs Web 3?\\n\\nSo on the one side, you have a complex, experimental, and arguably fragile Etherean ecosystem that provides the exciting new features that advocates want to see democratized through Web 3. On the other side, you have Dorsey and the Bitcoiners saying those cool applications rely on systems that are inadequately decentralized to gain the fundamental benefits of a blockchain, in part because those compromises help make the systems’ backers rich.\\n\\nBut the excluded middle here is that a lot of what’s touted as the promise of Web 3 is either impossible or very difficult to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s decentralization and bombproof security come at the expense of storage space, features and, most of all, transaction speed. If you’re playing a metaverse or Web 3 game, you don’t want to wait ten minutes or more for a confirmation that your new sword has arrived.\\n\\nTo be fair, some Web 3 features appear possible through layers built [on top of Bitcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/the-importance-of-bitcoin-upgrades-and-layer-two-applications/). Hiro, formerly Blockstack PBC, is building [smart contracts using Bitcoin](https://www.hiro.so/), and the potential for rough functional equivalents to NFTs and Ethereum’s ERC-20 tokens (sort of) has existed on Bitcoin in the form of [“colored coins”](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Colored_Coins) since around 2012.\\n\\nBut it seems unlikely that Bitcoin itself could support these applications at the scale and speed Web 3 advocates have in mind, even using layer 2s. At the same time, Bitcoin’s robust decentralization was achieved under a set of circumstances that is unlikely to ever be reproduced, especially after the regulatory crackdown on initial coin offerings (ICOs) starting in 2018.\\n\\nSo Dorsey’s knock on VCs’ role in Web 3 would seem to back him into a corner: It’s unclear that there are alternative routes to funding and building the Web 3 vision. The unspoken implication of Dorsey’s attacks seems to be that the Web 3 vision being bandied about should be either entirely rejected, or scaled back to something that can be accomplished on Bitcoin. Which, again, is a bit strange coming from a man who [has sold NFTs](https://twitter.com/tyler/status/1473656958435696644) and invested in decentralized social media.\\n\\nThat’s not to discount specific critiques of how VCs invest in new crypto tokens. There are some serious problems with presale discounts and short lockup periods for token launches, which really do often amount to [VCs dumping their bags](https://twitter.com/CasPiancey/status/1412050136381853702) on retail investors without a care in the world for whether the idea or technology behind the token are any good. Those issues desperately need to be addressed, though it’s also worth noting that they aren’t entirely crypto-specific. VCs have been getting preferential insider terms for decades.\\n\\nBut in his Bitcoiner ferocity, Dorsey may have missed the subtler compromise position that is relatively common in the crypto industry. Everyone who’s really paying attention recognizes that Bitcoin is a rock-solid and transformative technology – but many also keep their minds open to the idea that less cosmically robust systems may have real applications and benefits, too. Do you really need an entirely censorship-resistant blockchain to manage profile pic NFTs or your multiverse robe and wizard hat? Do purpose-built blockchains [like Flow](https://www.onflow.org/) really threaten Bitcoin?\\n\\nThose are genuine questions. This entire sector is still very, very new: Ethereum only launched six years ago! So a lot of people are suspending judgment and letting the chips fall where they may. Wherever you land, though, it may be healthy to nurture a little Bitcoin Maximalist to live on your right shoulder. Let it be your voice of skepticism towards anyone trying to sell you a hot new token – or an entire new buzzword whose meaning nobody can quite agree on.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ffelxcEoCO3kJZ6YCFUr-.jfif?height=1821&width=1080)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640315729,\"title\":\"Jack Dorsey争论的Web3 到底是什么？\"},\"digest\":\"DLfGhA6Nbza9ojDwFU1jMlTn6NLVJTcUhFaad82XisQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd8E93E06a84581c10DC1F9F60ec91f0F38994f1b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cMFgJWo0R83IUGP-oC59cCKhgfKZrezq-aV3fQc1AbU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"86rM09yJV_iikmgyczrUUMM5VZnQukEhY2ZNhB6MoeM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cM-Bp6C7jlRECAv8jWGWXEBgqZWTsx4uEAvGt6pZ94Az_HM00_GLSrdhjODdbV6qlyD-1wucpSpOdeEqnoDy2Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x55561c7f900b4987fad58cdc00d1050605ccc32081b4ec5049f35b5f327004393564d889a3c6c359c17cf0f2e7910adf9841dd8da6452b86f800d0eb1a62cd481b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cMFgJWo0R83IUGP-oC59cCKhgfKZrezq-aV3fQc1AbU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"86rM09yJV_iikmgyczrUUMM5VZnQukEhY2ZNhB6MoeM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7pQ9zXDmqfXnT69fO7sruu24mRxqJL92MXUQvP7FdWQ\"}"
