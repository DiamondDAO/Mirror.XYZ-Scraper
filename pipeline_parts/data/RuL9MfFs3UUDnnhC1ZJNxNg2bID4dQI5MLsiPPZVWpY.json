"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Central Bank of Russia is trying to assess the Bitcoin holdings of local investors because a large amount of funds have not returned to the bank after the withdrawal caused by the new crown pneumonia. According to Elizaveta Danilova, head of the Financial Stability Department of the Central Bank of Russia, the Bank of Russia is conducting a poll of local cryptocurrency investors to estimate the amount of cryptocurrency investment in Russia. Danilova said in an interview with Reuters, “We need to work on both data and raising public awareness of the risks of such investments. These investments have no basis. Danilova argues that the cryptocurrency market lacks transparency not only in Russia, but also in other jurisdictions. The same is true for jurisdictions, noting that crypto-derivative products such as Bitcoin futures or ETFs are more risky. \\\"The challenge is that the market is cross-border. People can invest in cryptocurrency through foreign intermediaries. Some major foreign exchange transactions involve huge risks in cryptocurrency derivatives. As the Central Bank of Russia is trying to analyze the volume of local crypto investment, Russians have recently been reluctant to deposit money in banks. According to Danilova, due to the new crown pneumonia pandemic, after large-scale withdrawals in 2020, as much as 2.6 trillion rubles (36 million U.S. dollars) have not been deposited back to the bank. Some existing data prove that cryptocurrency investment has become extremely popular in Russia. According to a survey conducted by the Russian Association of Foreign Exchange Dealers, as many as 77% of Russian investors prefer Bitcoin compared to traditional investment tools such as gold and foreign exchange.\",\"timestamp\":1634315156,\"title\":\"The Central Bank of Russia tried to assess the investor’s Bitcoin holdings, because the funds were not deposited back to the bank after the withdrawal of US$36 million\"},\"digest\":\"iFxnb61IyhfInZw_SanjWmhwJMuEjkNln5JbFG6FTFU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x83B2eC5c916f535819C2Dd3b058027C702d765Ac\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VEPNWuX-H-PeyXlFngfY9Uq0EuzyHY4yQzK5z1tgtlM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NnxSOOrsJQBd5sbR6RZDeTtH8UkNVIPxokQCriae_IY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"p_4BNOjzbD_Nh3MZqDAhnoGs9c8cGV-LF6Lmd3g8zx-zt9pgKk6u2UuJffxx9EFbhYQZNWElYOaBcSGWwGhpPw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8fb30997534ee34805813656bf98f119b96337856af4ec162794eb9f1ba920c764ab4c94e4be76f2f5caf96c734db5ca559f95f5e3142b5c3f9ab05485ad0bcc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VEPNWuX-H-PeyXlFngfY9Uq0EuzyHY4yQzK5z1tgtlM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NnxSOOrsJQBd5sbR6RZDeTtH8UkNVIPxokQCriae_IY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iFxnb61IyhfInZw_SanjWmhwJMuEjkNln5JbFG6FTFU\"}"
