"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When you first go down the web3 rabbit hole, your head spins. There are hundreds of terms you never head of, words that resemble real words and might mean the same thing (or not) and abbreviations that make every single Discord seem like an alien world. Web3 has it’s own language. This is **a problem**.\\n\\nWeb3 natives speak the language as it were plain English, but to newcomers, the learning curve is steep. As the development of the whole space is “early”, there are projects and papers popping up everywhere, but where should one go to learn the actual language of this new thing called web3 or metaverse or crypto or decentralization. There’s no obvious answer. This is **a problem worth solving**.\\n\\nDo we need a Wikipedia of web3? Or more like a native web3 way of collecting, structuring, presenting and maintaining the vast amount of knowledge being created all over the metaverse? This is **an exciting problem worth solving**.\\n\\nHow does one start to imagine a solution to learning web3 as a language? And is there more to develop on this topic after the basics are covered? Web3 is a skill and it will continue to develop as a skill. The workers of the very near future will have to be trained in web3, because once the natives switch to web3 careers, the workforce will continue to grow. Web3 as a skill is **an exciting opportunity**.\\n\\nNo individual can build a knowledge base of such proportions by himself. Existing companies have not expressed an interest in such an endeavor. DAOs seem to be focused on education only on very specific topics, but not the basics. But it has to start somewhere very soon. \\n\\nMirror seems like the perfect place to build the home of web3 as a language and the develop the knowledge base as a skill to be taught to the workers of the future. One block at a time.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jy-5ybwyl6eaxSYSb2N6s.jpg?height=4000&width=6000)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638310625,\"title\":\"Web3 as a skill\"},\"digest\":\"B1w9I9BS_TSKX-yeEp3NIMC9CmaapAClKNNTnGyTFrA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x89dB5742Eb293113E827b76121864f693F8A1A57\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jK-3a9sO7-n8vUcpV1fwMkNlQGdNxiTq92MlqcMHu9w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a7_0z2_rzmYX9kDegvztf2DjujSUlMhsoCGEMWGtw8M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4ZbWvmcaCaHr5NnqZAnDqF_sk_oZ-C-Ab5YsDXhKE9uqP9cfFplJvBiS7bp1EdONsdAdgNPxz-tjgOwPNxJ64g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bbd8c59a15dbf8bff82cd35025c1455b7cc76623f7fc22cde2f4ba664444aac66c2d5c4fe795002b8ae4fb38cbd5c139ec285570e27b769df3c13076fbb4b5e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jK-3a9sO7-n8vUcpV1fwMkNlQGdNxiTq92MlqcMHu9w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"a7_0z2_rzmYX9kDegvztf2DjujSUlMhsoCGEMWGtw8M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"B1w9I9BS_TSKX-yeEp3NIMC9CmaapAClKNNTnGyTFrA\"}"
