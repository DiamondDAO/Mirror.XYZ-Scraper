"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For example, cross-chain DEX can be developed on X Protocol, so that tokens issued on different blockchains can be traded freely through X Protocol, regardless of which chain assets it comes from. We can trade tokens just like in centralized exchanges, which will greatly reduce the transaction threshold. Improve users' trading experience.\\n\\nAs for DApp of lending, it can also be developed on X Protocol. Decentralized lending projects on X Protocol naturally have cross-chain functions. We can also develop DeFi projects such as income machine gun pool on X Protocol. DeFi applications running on X Protocol will greatly facilitate the free flow of digital currencies.\\n\\nFor the current popular track NFT, X Protocol also has layout, and NFT is combined with prediction proposal to realize the prediction proposal namely NFT. Every prediction proposal can generate NFT bound with equity, that is to say, these NFT are bound with real interests behind.\\n\\nX Protocol is developing its own application scenarios. X Predict has already been implemented in the X Protocol ecosystem. X Protocol and \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Protocol also announced a strategic partnership last month.\\n\\nX Predict Market is a decentralized, cross-chain prediction Market platform. Users can create and participate in prediction projects and obtain the CORRESPONDING NFT of the project. They can be rewarded with governance token POT for successful prediction and liquidity provision.\\n\\nIn fact, the decentralized prediction market is relatively large, so it makes sense for X Protocol to choose decentralized prediction as the breakthrough of ecological application landing.\\n\\nIn addition to decentralized prediction, DeFi, NFT and other hot areas, X Protocol will expand into other different areas (such as the metasexes) in the future. It will take advantage of boca's cross-chain advantages to achieve free cross-chain flow between different digital assets.\\n\\nAll in all, X Protocol is a polkadot-based cross-chain Protocol, which not only provides a decentralized bridge solution to achieve cross-chain asset management between different blockchains, such as decentralized lending, DEX, etc., but also provides decentralized data aggregation analysis functions, such as decentralized prediction, etc. X Protocol will make use of its cross-chain advantages to continuously expand the application scenarios. Basically, X Protocol has all the functions that other public chains can provide, but other public chains may not have them.\\n\\nRisk Note: The above content does not constitute investment advice.
