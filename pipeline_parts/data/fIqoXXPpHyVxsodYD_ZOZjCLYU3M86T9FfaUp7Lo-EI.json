"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"She a beauty? I would sooner call Weasley a wit,\\\" Hermione repeated his words in a sullen tone that he shuddered to think was even close to what his had been. \\\"Viktor and I were within earshot and you most certainly knew it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because that Durmstrang pillock had his hand on your arse!\\\" Draco ground out, digging his fingernails into the flesh of his palm. \\\"The hands are supposed to be *strictly* restricted to the waist. Probably not civilized enough to take a waltz lesson in his entire life! Too busy acing the part of the hunchback of Notre Dame on his sodding broom! Or *maybe* he thought it was a convenient time to forget his manners and give his lust a free reign- you certainly looked very receptive of his advances-all giggles and hair flicking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Three things. One, how do you know anything about the hunchback of Notre Dame? Two, if I was willing, why do you care?\\\" She paused and considered him for a long moment before asking, \\\"And three, if we danced together, would you have kept your hands to my waist?\\\"\\n\\nHis tongue grew thick in his mouth. Numerous fantasies flashed through his mind. He would have to go all in. \\\"Because one, you told me you *may* consider holding hands with me if I educate myself on muggle literature. And now I know a great many things more than that tale because..I started enjoying what you recommended. For example, Her-mi-o-ne: the tip of the tongue takes a trip of four steps down the palate to circle inside the mouth, a wholesome fantasy. Because two, I couldn't sleep properly for three weeks wondering what Pureblood torture techniques I could use on his slimy hands without you ever finding out. Because three, I would have explored much more...if you were willing.\\\"\\n\\nHermione gazed at her feet. \\\"I was also not civilized enough to get dancing lessons my entire life.\\\"\\n\\nHe felt as if a particularly spiteful goblin was juggling knuts, sickles, and galleons inside his stomach. Sodding hell! Why could he not think through before speaking when most required?  At length- this time making sure his words could not be misconstrued in any way, even by her- he said, \\\"You are a quick learner. I could teach you.\\\" \\n\\n\\\"You mean here?\\\" She bit her bottom lip. He wondered if her lips would be as soft and welcoming as they looked.\\n\\n\\\"Here is perfect,\\\" he said, rolling back his shoulders and placing a trembling hand-he hoped she hadn't noticed that-on her waist to draw her closer. It was an immense consolation to his hyper alert senses that her breathing was also coming out ragged. A willing Granger in his arms, no spiked love potion in her system- not his finest moment but he did play with the thought one particularly anxious night-was his addled brain manifesting his lusty fantasies?\\n\\nThey had never been so close. She held herself very stiffly, probably as nervous as him. \\n\\nHe dipped his head next to her ear and said, \\\"What I meant that day was of course that you were the wit, and Weasley the beauty.\\\"\\n\\nA sudden laugh-throaty, unpolished, and unrestrained, broke out from her lips and she stifled it on his shoulder, her shoulders shaking with her mirth. Her hair smelled like Bulgarian roses.\\n\\n*He* had made her laugh. Without thirty dress rehearsals with the punchline no less.\\n\\nNo, his heart was not fluttering like a snitch. Maybe if Hippogriff could flutter, he decided, it could make for an apt and manly analogy.\\n\\nHis hand tightened on her waist.\\n\\nHe got this. \\n\\nFin.\\n\\n***Notes***\\n\\n\\\\*Pride & Prejudice insult: \\\"She a beauty? I would sooner call her mother a wit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\* Her-mi-o-ne: the tip of the tongue takes a trip of four steps down. This one from Lolita, what else? I had to say Hermione ten times to check if that reference was correct. Is it though?\\n\\nTitle quote from Leonard Cohen.
