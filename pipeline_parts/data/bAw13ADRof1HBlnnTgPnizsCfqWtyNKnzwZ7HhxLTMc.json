"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Now, every true venture is made against risk and uncertainty, against anxiety and danger and fear.  And it is just this that constitutes the nobleness and blessedness of faith. Faith sells all for Christ.  Faith risks all for eternal life. Faith faces all for salvation.  When it is at the worst, faith still says, Very well; even if there is no Celestial City anywhere in the world, it is better to die still seeking it than to live on in the City of Destruction.  Even if there is no Jesus Christ,--I have read about Him and heard about Him and pictured Him to myself, till, say what you will, I shall die kissing and embracing that Divine Image I have in my heart.  Even if there is neither mercy- seat nor intercession in heaven, I shall henceforth pray without ceasing.  Far far better for me all the rest of my sinful life to be clothed with sackcloth and ashes, even if there is no fountain opened in Jerusalem for sin and uncleanness, and no change of raiment.  Christian protested that, as for him, lions and all, he had no choice left.  And no more have we.  He must away somewhere, anywhere, from his past life.  And so must we.  If all the lions that ever drank blood are to collect upon his way, let them do so; they shall not all make him turn back.  Why should they?  What is a whole forest full of lions to a heart and a life full of sin? Lions are like lambs compared with sin.  'Good morning!  I for one must venture.  I shall yet go forward.'  So Mistrust and Timorous ran down the hill, and Christian went on his way.\\n\\nSo I saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward, that if possible he might get lodging in the house called Beautiful that stood by the highway side.  Now, before he had gone far he entered into a very narrow passage which was about a furlong off from the porter's lodge, and looking very narrowly before him as he went, he espied two lions in the way.  Then was he afraid, and thought also to go back, for he thought that nothing but death was before him. But the porter at the lodge, whose name was Watchful, perceiving that Christian made a halt, as if he would go back, cried unto him, saying, 'Is thy strength so small?  Fear not the lions, for they are chained, and are only placed there for the trial of faith where it is, and for the discovery of those who have none.  Keep the midst of the path and no hurt shall come to thee.'  Yes, that is all we have to do.  Whatever our past life may have been, whatever our past sins, past errors of judgment, past mistakes and mishaps, whatever of punishment or chastisement or correction or instruction or sanctification and growth in grace may be under those lions' skins and between their teeth for us, all we have got to do at present is to leave the lions to Him who set them there, and to go on, up to them and past them, keeping always to the midst of the path.  The lions may roar at us till they have roared us deaf and blind, but we are far safer in the midst of that path than we would be in our own bed.  Only let us keep in the midst of the path. When their breath is hot and full of blood on our cheek; when they paw up the blinding earth; when we feel as if their teeth had closed round our heart,--still, all the more, let us keep in the midst of the path.  We must sometimes walk on a razor-edge of fear and straightforwardness; that is the only way left for us now. But, then, we have the Divine assurance that on that perilous edge no hurt shall come to us.  'Temptations,' says our author in another place, 'when we meet them at first, are as the lion that roared upon Samson; but if we overcome them, the next time we see them we shall find a nest of honey in them.'  O God, for grace and sense and imagination to see and understand and apply all that to our own daily life!  O to be able to take all that home to-night and see it all there; lions and runaways, venturesome souls, narrow paths, palaces of beauty, everlasting life and all!  Open Thou our eyes that we may see the wonderful things that await us in our own house at home!\\n\\n'Things out of hope are compassed oft with venturing.'\\n\\nSo they are; and so they were that day with our terrified pilgrim. He made a venture at the supreme moment of his danger, and things that were quite out of all hope but an hour before were then compassed and ever after possessed by him.  Make the same venture, then, yourselves to-night.  Naught venture, naught have.  Your lost soul is not much to venture, but it is all that Christ at this moment asks of you--that you leave your lost soul in His hand, and then go straight on from this moment in the middle of the path: the path, that is, as your case may be, of purity, humility, submission, resignation, and self-denial.  Keep your mind and your heart, your eyes and your feet, in the very middle of that path, and you shall have compassed the House Beautiful before you know. The lions shall soon be behind you, and the grave and graceful damsels of the House--Discretion and Prudence and Piety and Charity--shall all be waiting upon you.\\n\\nPRUDENCE {1}\\n\\n'Let a man examine himself.'--Paul.\\n\\nLet a man examine himself, says the apostle to the Corinthians, and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.  And thus it was, that before the pilgrim was invited to sit down at the supper table in the House Beautiful, quite a number of most pointed and penetrating questions were put to him by those who had charge of that house and its supper table.  And thus the time was excellently improved till the table was spread, while the short delay and the successive exercises whetted to an extraordinary sharpness the pilgrim's hunger for the supper.  Piety and Charity, who had joint charge of the house from the Master of the house, held each a characteristic conversation with Christian, but it was left to Prudence to hold the most particular discourse with him until supper was ready, and it is to that so particular discourse that I much wish to turn your attention to-night.\\n\\nWith great tenderness, but at the same time with the greatest possible gravity, Prudence asked the pilgrim whether he did not still think sometimes of the country from whence he had come out. Yes, he replied; how could I help thinking continually of that unhappy country and of my sad and miserable life in it; but, believe me,--or, rather, you cannot believe me,--with what shame and detestation I always think of my past life.  My face burns as I now speak of my past life to you, and as I think what my old companions know and must often say about me.  I detest, as you cannot possibly understand, every remembrance of my past life, and I hate and never can forgive myself, who, with mine own hands, so filled all my past life with shame and self-contempt.  Gently stopping the remorseful pilgrim's self-accusations about his past life, Prudence asked him if he had not still with him, and, indeed, within him, some of the very things that had so destroyed both him and all his past life.  'Yes,' he honestly and humbly said.  'Yes, but greatly against my will:  especially my inward and sinful cogitations.'  At this Prudence looked on him with all her deep and soft eyes, for it was to this that she had been leading the conversation up all the time.  Prudence had a great look of satisfaction, mingled with love and pity, at the way the pilgrim said 'especially my inward and sinful cogitations.'  Those who stood by and observed Prudence wondered at her delight in the sad discourse on which the pilgrim now entered.  But she had her own reasons for her delight in this particular kind of discourse, and it was seldom that she lighted on a pilgrim who both understood her questions and responded to them as did this man now sitting beside her.  Now, my brethren, all parable apart, is that your religious experience?  Are you full of shame and detestation at your inward cogitations?  Are you tormented, enslaved, and downright cursed with your own evil thoughts?  I do not ask whether or no you have such thoughts always within you.  I do not ask, because I know. But I ask, because I would like to make sure that you know what, and the true nature of what, goes on incessantly in your mind and in your heart.  Do you, or do you not, spit out your most inward thoughts ten times a day like poison?  If you do, you are a truly religious man, and if you do not, you do not yet know the very ABC of true religion, and your dog has a better errand at the Lord's table than you have.  And if your minister lets you sit down at the Lord's table without holding from time to time some particular discourse with you about your sinful thoughts, he is deceiving and misleading you, besides laying up for himself an awakening at last to shame and everlasting contempt.  What a mill-stone his communion roll will be round such a minister's neck!  And how his congregation will gnash their teeth at him when they see to what his miserable ministry has brought them!\\n\\nLet a man examine himself, said Paul.  What about your inward and sinful cogitations? asked Prudence.  How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? demanded the bold prophet.  Now, my brethren, what have you to say to that particular accusation? Do you know what vain thoughts are?  Are you at all aware what multitudes of such thoughts lodge within you?  Do they drive you every day to your knees, and do you blush with shame when you are alone before God at the fountain of folly that fills your mind and your heart continually?  The Apostle speaks of vain hopes that make us ashamed that we ever entertained them.  You have been often so ashamed, and yet do not such hopes still too easily arise in your heart?  What castles of idiotic folly you still build!  Were a sane man or a modest woman even to dream such dreams of folly overnight, they would blush and hide their heads all day at the thought.  Out of a word, out of a look, out of what was neither a word nor a look intended for you, what a world of vanity will you build out of it! The question of Prudence is not whether or no you are still a born fool at heart, she does not put unnecessary questions:  hers to you is the more pertinent and particular question, whether, since you left your former life and became a Christian, you feel every day increasing shame and detestation at yourself, on account of the vanity of your inward cogitations.  My brethren, can you satisfy her who is set by her Master to hold particular discourse with all true Christians before supper?  Can you say with the Psalmist,-- could you tell Prudence where the Psalmist says,--I hate vain thoughts, but Thy law do I love?  And can you silence her by telling her that her Master alone knows with what shame you think that He has such a fool as you are among His people?\\n\\nAnger, also, sudden and even long-entertained anger, was one of the 'many failings' of which Christian was so conscious to himself. His outbursts of anger at home, he bitterly felt, might well be one of the causes why his wife and children did not accompany him on his pilgrimage.  And though he knew his failing in this respect, and was very wary of it, yet he often failed even when he was most wary.  Now, while anger is largely a result of our blood and temperament, yet few of us are so well-balanced and equable in our temperament and so pure and cool in our blood, as altogether to escape frequent outbursts of anger.  The most happily constituted and the best governed of us have too much cause to be ashamed and penitent both before God and our neighbours for our outbursts of angry passion.  But Prudence is so particular in her discourse before supper, that she goes far deeper into our anger than our wives and our children, our servants and our neighbours, can go. She not only asks if we stamp out the rising anger of our heart as we would stamp out sparks of fire in a house full of gunpowder; but she insists on being told what we think of ourselves when the house of our heart is still so full of such fire and such gunpowder.  Any man, to call a man, would be humbled in his own eyes and in his walk before his house at home after an explosion of anger among them; but he who would satisfy Prudence and sit beside her at supper, must not only never let his anger kindle, but the simple secret heat of it, that fire of hell that is hid from all men but himself in the flint of his own hard and proud heart,--what, asks Prudence, do you think of that, and of yourself on account of that? Does that keep you not only watchful and prayerful, but, what is the best ground in you of all true watchfulness and prayerfulness, full of secret shame, self-fear, and self-detestation?  One forenoon table would easily hold all our communicants if Prudence had the distribution of the tokens.\\n\\nAnd, then, we who are true pilgrims, are of all men the most miserable, on account of that 'failing,' that rankling sting in our hearts, when any of our friends has more of this world's possessions, honours, and praises than we have, that pain at our neighbour's pleasure, that sickness at his health, that hunger for what we see him eat, that thirst for what we see him drink, that imprisonment of our spirits when we see him set at liberty, that depression at his exaltation, that sorrow at his joy, and joy at his sorrow, that evil heart that would have all things to itself. Yes, said Christian, I am only too conversant with all these sinful cogitations, but they are all greatly against my will, and might I but choose mine own thoughts, do you suppose that I would ever think these things any more?  'The cause is in my will,' said Caesar, on a great occasion.  But the true Christian, unhappily, cannot say that.  If he could say that, he would soon say also that the snare is broken and that his soul has escaped.  And then the cause of all his evil cogitations, his vain thoughts, his angry feelings, his envious feelings, his ineradicable covetousness, his hell-rooted and heaven-towering pride, and his whole evil heart of unbelief would soon be at an end.  'I cannot be free of sin,' said Thomas Boston, 'but God knows that He would be welcome to make havoc of my lusts to-night and to make me henceforth a holy man.  I know no lust that I would not be content to part with.  My will bound hand and foot I desire to lay at His feet.'  Yes:  such is the mystery and depth of sin in the hearts of all God's saints, that far deeper than their will, far back behind their will, the whole substance and very core of their hearts is wholly corrupt and enslaved to sin.  And thus it is that while their renewed and delivered will works out, so far, their salvation in their walk and conversation among men, the helplessness of their will in the cleansing and the keeping of their hearts is to the end the sorrow and the mystery of their sanctification.  To will was present with Paul, and with Bunyan, and with Boston; but their heart--they could not with all their keeping keep their heart.  No man can; no man who has at all tried it can.  'Might I but choose mine own thoughts, I would choose never to think of these things more:  but when I would be doing of that which is best, that which is worst is with me.'  We can choose almost all things.  Our will and choice have almost all things at their disposal.  We can choose our God. We can choose life or death.  We can choose heaven or hell.  We can choose our church, our minister, our books, our companions, our words, our works, and, to some extent, our inward thoughts, but only to some extent.  We can encourage this or that thought; we can entertain it and dwell upon it; or we can detect it, detest it, and cast it out.  But that secret place in our heart where our thoughts hide and harbour, and out of which they spring so suddenly upon the mind and the heart, the imagination and the conscience,--of that secretest of all secret places, God alone is able to say, I search the heart.  'As for secret thoughts,' says our author, speaking of his own former religious life, 'I took no notice of them, neither did I understand what Satan's temptations were, nor how they were to be withstood and resisted.'  But now all these things are his deepest grief, as they are ours,--as many of us as have been truly turned in our deepest hearts to God.\\n\\n'But,' replied Prudence, 'do you not find sometimes as if those things were vanquished which at other times are your perplexity?' 'Yes, but that is but seldom; but they are to me golden hours in which such things happen to me.'  'Can you remember by what means you find your annoyances at times as if they were vanquished?' 'Yes, when I think what I saw at the cross, that will do it; and when I look upon my broidered coat, that will do it; also, when I look into the roll that I carry in my bosom, that will do it; and when my thoughts wax warm about whither I am going, that will do it.'  Yes; and these same things have many a time done it to ourselves also.  We also, my brethren--let me tell you your own undeniable experience--we also have such golden hours sometimes, when we feel as if we should never again have such an evil heart within us.  The Cross of Christ to us also has done it.  It is of such golden hours that Isaac Watts sings in his noble hymn:\\n\\n'When I survey the wondrous Cross;'\\n\\nand as often as we sing that hymn with our eyes upon the object, that will for a time vanquish our worst cogitations.  Also, when we read the roll that we too carry in our bosom--that is to say, when we go back into our past life till we see it and feel it all, and till we can think and speak of nothing else but the sin that abounded in it and the grace that much more abounded, that has a thousand times given us also golden hours, even rest from our own evil hearts.  And we also have often made our hearts too hot for sin to show itself, when we read our hearts deep into such books as The Paradiso, The Pilgrim's Progress, The Saint's Rest, The Serious Call, The Religious Affections, and such like.  These books have often vanquished our annoyances, and given us golden hours on the earth.  Yes, but that is but seldom.\\n\\n'Now, what is it,' asked Prudence, as she wound up this so particular colloquy, 'that makes you so desirous to go to Mount Zion?'\\n\\n'Why,' replied the pilgrim, and the water stood in his eyes, 'why, there I hope to see Him alive that did hang dead on the cross; and there I hope to be rid of all those things that to this day are an annoyance to me; there they say is no death, and there shall I dwell with such company as I love best.  For, to tell you truth, I love Him, because by Him I was eased of my burden, and I am weary of my inward sickness; and I would fain be where I shall die no more, and for ever with that company that shall continually cry, Holy, holy, holy.'\\n\\nCHARITY\\n\\n'I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.'--David.\\n\\nThere can be nobody here to-night so stark stupid as to suppose that the pilgrim had run away from home and left his wife and children to the work-house.  There have been wiseacres who have found severe fault with John Bunyan because he made his Puritan pilgrim such a bad husband and such an unnatural father.  But nobody possessed of a spark of common sense, not to say religion or literature, would ever commit himself to such an utter imbecility as that.  John Bunyan's pilgrim, whatever he may have been before he became a pilgrim, all the time he was a pilgrim, was the most faithful, affectionate, and solicitous husband in all the country round about, and the tenderest, the most watchful, and the wisest of fathers.  This pilgrim stayed all the more at home that he went so far away from home; he accomplished his whole wonderful pilgrimage beside his own forge and at his own fireside; and he entered the Celestial City amid trumpets and bells and harps and psalms, while all the time sleeping in his own humble bed.  The House Beautiful, therefore, to which we have now come in his company, is not some remote and romantic mansion away up among the mountains a great many days' journey distant from this poor man's everyday home.  The House Beautiful was nothing else,--what else better, what else so good could it be?--than just this Christian man's first communion Sabbath and his first communion table (first, that is, after his true conversion from sin to God and his confessed entrance into a new life), while the country from whence he had come out, and concerning which both Piety and Prudence catechised him so closely, was just his former life of open ungodliness and all his evil walk and conversation while he was as yet living without God and without hope in the world.  The country on which he confessed that he now looked back with so much shame and detestation was not England or Bedfordshire, but the wicked life he had lived in that land and in that shire.  And when Charity asked him as to whether he was a married man and had a family, she knew quite well that he was, only she made a pretence of asking him those domestic questions in order thereby to start the touching conversation.\\n\\nBeginning, then, at home, as she always began, Charity said to Christian, 'Have you a family?  Are you a married man?'  'I have a wife and four small children,' answered Christian.  'And why did you not bring them with you?'  Then Christian wept and said, 'Oh, how willingly would I have done so, but they were all of them utterly averse to my going on pilgrimage.'  'But you should have talked to them and have shown them their danger.'  'So I did,' he replied, 'but I seemed to them as one that mocked.'  Now, this of talking, and, especially, of talking about religious things to children, is one of the most difficult things in the world,--that is, to do it well.  Some people have the happy knack of talking to their own and to other people's children so as always to interest and impress them.  But such happy people are few.  Most people talk at their children whenever they begin to talk to them, and thus, without knowing it, they nauseate their children with their conversation altogether.  To respect a little child, to stand in some awe of a little child, to choose your topics, your opportunities, your neighbourhood, your moods and his as well as all your words, and always to speak your sincerest, simplest, most straightforward and absolutely wisest is indispensable with a child.  Take your mannerisms, your condescensions, your affectations, your moralisings, and all your insincerities to your debauched equals, but bring your truest and your best to your child.  Unless you do so, you will be sure to lay yourself open to a look that will suddenly go through you, and that will swiftly convey to you that your child sees through you and despises you and your conversation too.  'You should not only have talked to your children of their danger,' said Charity, 'but you should have shown them their danger.'  Yes, Charity; but a man must himself see his own and his children's danger too, before he can show it to them, as well as see it clearly at the time he is trying to show it to them.  And how many fathers, do you suppose, have the eyes to see such danger, and how then can they shew such danger to their children, of all people?  Once get fathers to see dangers or anything else aright, and then you will not need to tell them how they are to instruct and impress their children.  Nature herself will then tell them how to talk to their children, and when Nature teaches, all our children will immediately and unweariedly listen.\",\"timestamp\":1641288964,\"title\":\"I shall venture!' said Christian to the two terrified and retreating men\"},\"digest\":\"msli7dIs_1gNk4apXJWAMHM9cFRtdFRxW80R-VJDXZE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e5524266431C8A2Cd3e28b5B838834791C3533a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dq6XUvQxxinZFZbgjoT9unYhEgCaUYwPy8j3JueJC4I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rxdtT0ddIuTf3VZu8ut-OxudKw0Fti9DwymL1f1KuWw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Z_HxbBmoA401bdm2vUioVnef2yHZAjCyboyzFCUcaM8c6AkZ-Q4XiBn7oBmStoDY4lIHInmzNbqrX2w8v4dsOg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x98a0fa8af2e607ed47582981e1b33a4d956d08292d29c39bfd0e16ad611a70de3a78ae90241508566afa3d8c313139c28908ebaee822d8a60dfdc41396cf55e81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dq6XUvQxxinZFZbgjoT9unYhEgCaUYwPy8j3JueJC4I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rxdtT0ddIuTf3VZu8ut-OxudKw0Fti9DwymL1f1KuWw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"msli7dIs_1gNk4apXJWAMHM9cFRtdFRxW80R-VJDXZE\"}"
