"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Story; a form of stored information presented in a narrative form. \\n \\n\\nStories are how we make sense, perceive and enjoy the world. Everything is a story, from the gossip about our neighbours, to the more classical novel and all the way from instagram stories and Snapchat to movies and series. We consume stories in ways never heard of before. While they used to be passed on mouth to mouth and thought to contain events as they happened, we have moved toward elaborate fictional stories without any basis in our physical realm. Series are a good example of this. People are hooked on finding out what will happen in realms that never have nor ever could possibly exist. Yet they need to know how the story will continue. Often even when the end is not in sight or never will be. Series can go on for years given enough demand. The same is true of films. We have recently seen the fast and the furious 7 release date announced, even after people joke about how absurd the sequels are becoming. People love keeping a good story going even if it becomes very mediocre, the continuation takes precedence over the story in itself. After all it is better to have some story than none.\\n\\nBut this is in our fast modern day world. In simpler times people did not have access to as many or as quick and thrilling stories. They would either be told and would be considered represent the \\\"truth\\\" albeit bolstered out a bit, or later after invention of the printing press would have to be read and interpreted. Here is one key distinction that is important to make when considering how stories are told. The level of involvement by the listener. This varies hugely and is responsible for the effects stories have on their audience. One subtle point worth pointing out simultaneously is the illusion of a dichotomy between consuming and producing stories. It would be easy to say that the story teller tells and the listener listens but that is false. It is clear that both aspects are as important as they cannot exist without each other. Equally both lend aspects from each other. The listener does not blindly listen he has a mind and a set of beliefs that help him interpret and so to say \\\"retells\\\" the story to himself. The teller equally must also be aware of this fact and thus tell the story in such a way as to involve the listener to the desired extent. As stories are a form of communication (arguable the most important) they must famously be a two-way street.\\n\\nEach writer is also a reader and every reader also a writer what changes is the matter of degree on each behalf.\\n\\nLet us inspect some examples to illustrate this point. \\n \\n\\nWorld of Warcraft vs Netflix\\n\\nAs a child I was addicted to a massive multiplayer online role playing game, the most famous, largest and in my humble opinion still best game. You choose a customisable character from different races (elves, humans, orcs etc.) and a class (Mage, paladin, hunter, warrior etc.). After this it becomes your goal to write this character's story. You level them up, gain experience, earn gold, go on quests, socialise, ride animals and dragons, and fight; effectively writing the characters story. Yet the writing occurs only on a micro level limited by external factors such as the game designers and developers. It is for example impossible to make love in world of Warcraft such that even if you wanted your character to be a wild Casanova they could never be and would stay limited to riding the available animals and dragons. Yet still the choice of such a mount is more or less entirely up to the consumer of the game. So in video games as in life there are boundary conditions but still a relatively large amount of freedom in writing the story that is being consumed. So much so that they merge and the boundary between story writer and story reader become indistinguishable. Ultimately the game's producers are telling the vague story (you have character in this realm with these skills and it looks the way these artists imagined it) but the freedom left to the listener is very large in that he still creates a significant part of the story himself. \\n\\nIn stark contrast hereby stands Netflix, the brand name modern synonym for watching television. The selling point where Netflix one-ups good old fashioned telly is the fact that no longer am I subjected to some program running on a schedule but can more or less choose when and what I want to watch for as long as I want to. Of course there are limitations such as a not all episodes being available yet or having watched all seasons and having to wait for the next one to start but generally the freedom to choose is larger than with regular TV. This seems like an advantage and an equal freedom to video games, yet it is not. This freedom to choose is merely on a superficial level, it is the choice of which story to listen to. Once the series is selected it is watched and apart from the little room left to interpret the pixels on a screen the story has been written. Now one could argue that depending on the brain viewing the series the interpretation will vary and while this may be true it happens to much lesser degree than with a video game. The episode I am watching will be reproduced exactly as is for every viewer (except maybe with subtitles or different languages). Whereas video games offer a tailored experience depending on the player, thus creating a feedback loop. This loop is much less present with many forms of stories even if there is some interpretation and maybe even feedback (fans can play a large role in series' directions and stories) taking part on the story receivers side.\\n\\nThe active part in stories varies. If we would like to make a hierarchical list from most active to passive it would be as follows: writing a story by hand (or computer), telling a story (the listener is providing immediate feedback), shooting a film or taking a picture, posting on social media, reading a story, listening to a story, playing video games, viewing a film or picture. Ordering these serves merely as a guideline because the active/passive portions vary depending on specifics. The stories with large listener involvement may only slightly overweight the tellers role. For instance taking a picture could be viewed as an artistic endeavour with complex symbolism telling a meaningful story or it could be a drunken selfie on a night out that was taken in a forgotten stupor. Even then a story is told yet the person telling the story leaves less room for interpretation. Generally the rule seems to be that the more vague a story is the more equal the roles are, written stories due to their lack of any visual aids are the most ambiguous and leave much space for imagination. Films on the other hand have very clear visuals and cut out much interpretation, this is where the dilemma of books becoming films stems from. Oftentimes people feel books are deeper or richer than their cinematic counterparts , yet what they are trying to articulate is the vastness of their imagination. The written word apple conjures up many different apples for different people and even for the same person it is a dynamic apple than might instantly be eatable or poisoned, red or green depending on the following paragraphs and/or moods, culture even chance along with many other factors. Once the same apple is portrayed in film it is \\\"fixed\\\", definite so to say, it has lost all probability of being anything else than the apple filmed. It might still be poisoned or not but its colour for instance is set. It has lost much of is uncertainty that is conveyed by the written word. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1639476236,\"title\":\"A story about stories \\n\"},\"digest\":\"Dc9jVmK6768orjpu-4KJ9ME050eM_zDuMoDDbNhsNLw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcC1Fa03e8172B22B90a68615872F47D3B703A610\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eo3JkEAtfJinw21TQ172nixEGd1oZ38U6kn0Hh1isS3lcMlMCkE5McnbeTjr6ACTocR99iX4PnTK5yDERvBq9A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x604ab1fb886724196c480c557c059bad0a71cc5d1af0bd5421202517fc744bd96d893a7212cc12082dbde2685be15114ba162a8c9742cf9a71a0be9568d930751b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Dc9jVmK6768orjpu-4KJ9ME050eM_zDuMoDDbNhsNLw\"}"
