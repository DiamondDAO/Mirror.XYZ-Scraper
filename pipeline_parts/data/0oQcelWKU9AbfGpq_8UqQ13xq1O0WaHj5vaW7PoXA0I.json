"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1989 Berlin**\\n\\nThey were the \\\"No Future Generation\\\" and they had music to go with that vision of the future. \\n\\nIt was experimental. At first it was acid, it was new wave, it was punk. It was a sound for people in Berlin, after years of the Cold War, who didn't fit in the world. It was called \\\"Techno\\\" - sounds against the \\\"System\\\". Spartan music which made space for a generation to dance inside of.\\n\\nThere was no Johnny Rotten, no \\\"Mick\\\". There was for a moment Iggy and Bowie but they weren't staying. Those who came and stayed, and lived with hearts on sleeves, were into music, art and design (sometimes wore colored rats on their sleeves like punk girls did to match their hair colors.) Some tagged the \\\"Wall\\\".\\n\\nThe music was a bridge between East and West, and there was no \\\"Checkpoint Charlie\\\".\\n\\nWhen the dominoes propping up an Iron Curtain began to fall in reverse, there opened new spaces between spaces - in the mind and on the broken grid of a divided city. In old industrial spaces, in the woods, everywhere, they made a \\\"scene\\\" for the new sounds. In those post industrial ad hoc spaces, there was a post-industrial import which got plugged in like synths into amps, sounds from Detroit.\\n\\nThe first space included an abandoned basement vault of a forgotten building. Tresor. More came. East met west. The sound of the walls falling was a new sound for a generation reuniting with itself. Techno was the sound of the Walls falling.\\n\\nA secret war was giving way to summits on dance floors.\\n\\n\\\"No Future\\\" gave way to \\\"New Future\\\".\\n\\n**2917 Outer System, onboard the ship \\\"The Magpie\\\"**\\n\\n\\\"That's it, Jacob, you always had a touch the 'old girl' needed.\\\" teased AL. He patted an engine panel of their home, a world within a world.\\n\\n\\\"Uncle AL, I think the 'old girl' needs an overhaul, like me”, joked Jacob.\\n\\n\\\"Well, before we do that, I need to introduce you to a protege of June.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"June? I didn’t know she was taking on trainees after all this time.”\\n\\nJune knew Jacob since he was a baby, and when AL was a young man.\\n\\nJune Birmingham, left Earth decades ago, when the Long War ended. \\n\\nShe was the last of the great Shipbuilders, friend of late Cmdr. Jacob C. Tagore, Sr. and the late Dr. John Cadmus. And she was the last surviving member of the original trio who started a secret war of resistance against the Triumvirate.\\n\\n\\\"Jakey, it's been so long. You've been away from home for such a long time\\\" and then June paused, \\\"you look so much like 'Big Jake'. And you have the same eyes now too. You've seen too much but maybe that is for the best. I have someone I want you to meet. She's from Ganymede in a round'about way, her last home was Earth for while. Not sure if you met.\\\"\\n\\nIn walked a very familiar face, one of the System's most famous, the \\\"exotic Jovian\\\" star, \\\"1 of 1\\\", known as \\\"Lenamay\\\" to many of fans on the 'Verse. Elena Firmina May, one of the greatest “Expee” creators of the ‘Verse in the System.\\n\\n\\\"Jacob, I'm Elena. It's great to meet you. June told me we’d meet.\\\"\\n\\nJacob shook hands, and didn't mention that he knew Elena's last mentor, the \\\"Lady Fernanda\\\", the Grand Lady of 'Expees', or \\\"experiences\\\", the art, entertainment and medium of the 'Verse.\\n\\n\\\"Elena, I thought I recognized you... from your amazing work. It's great to meet you. Are you here for some kind of research for your art, or...?\\\" Jacob looked over at AL and June.\\n\\n\\\"Jakey, you might have been drafted as a family member. Elena is a volunteer. Her last mentor was an old acquaintance of mine.”\\n\\nJacob was surprised that June knew “Lady Fernanda” but didn’t show it, a habit burned into his mind and body after years with Mars Intelligence Services. He wondered if Fate was a real force.\\n\\n\\\"How?\\\" Jacob wanted to listen and not say too much just yet.\\n\\n\\\"Elena has become a promising Shipmaster. She has a talent for flying. Any kind of ship.”\\n\\nJacob thought about his team from Mars, who were training to pilot as many DeepShips as possible. They could use the help.\\n\\n\\\"I know we've just met, but I can help. I can do this,” said Elena.\\n\\n\\\"Elena, I think it's time we all have lunch and then talk about overhauling our \\\"Plan\\\". But first I need help to give the 'Magpie' an overhaul.\\\" There was so much to do, and years to go.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BdJA2dPzw6XR4bn_ocpj9.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IRkiImIj9a5KmNmUjD9nV.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633902893,\"title\":\"1961: 5.30 The Sounds of Falling Walls, The End of The Beginning Again, 2917\"},\"digest\":\"raXGh-UlFEyly7BOdukYQWILUfNM8L38Nif9CqpmxEY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bzrczE-vfcOuy4SzQgDV0mQnC0bMHajso_08C30SVUvepEVsBlSZWHxYBtiImILyT0SCF_25wccwKvzy4easyA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5nJ9FiwRQ3ubjr0uSiirzuMEFlNHxtrHHIGOxmcNXBk\"}"
