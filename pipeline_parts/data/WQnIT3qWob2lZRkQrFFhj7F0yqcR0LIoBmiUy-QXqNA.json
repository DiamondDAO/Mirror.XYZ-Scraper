"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Folk had fixed up a party at his studio to meet her.  She had been there once or twice; but this was a final affair.  She had finished her business in Paris and would be leaving the next morning.  To her surprise, she found Phillips there.  He had come over hurriedly to attend a Socialist conference, and Leblanc, the editor of Le Nouveau Monde, had brought him along.\\n\\n\\\"I took Smedley's place at the last moment,\\\" he whispered to her. \\\"I've never been abroad before.  You don't mind, do you?\\\"\\n\\nIt didn't strike her as at all odd that a leader of a political party should ask her \\\"if she minded\\\" his being in Paris to attend a political conference.  He was wearing a light grey suit and a blue tie.  There was nothing about him, at that moment, suggesting that he was a leader of any sort.  He might have been just any man, but for his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she whispered.  \\\"Of course not.  I don't like your tie.\\\"  It seemed to depress him, that.\\n\\nShe felt elated at the thought that he would see her for the first time amid surroundings where she would shine.  Folk came forward to meet her with that charming air of protective deference that he had adopted towards her.  He might have been some favoured minister of state kissing the hand of a youthful Queen.  She glanced down the long studio, ending in its fine window overlooking the park.  Some of the most distinguished men in Paris were there, and the immediate stir of admiration that her entrance had created was unmistakable.  Even the women turned pleased glances at her; as if willing to recognize in her their representative.  A sense of power came to her that made her feel kind to all the world.  There was no need for her to be clever:  to make any effort to attract.  Her presence, her sympathy, her approval seemed to be all that was needed of her.  She had the consciousness that by the mere exercise of her will she could sway the thoughts and actions of these men: that sovereignty had been given to her.  It reflected itself in her slightly heightened colour, in the increased brilliance of her eyes, in the confident case of all her movements.  It added a compelling softness to her voice.\\n\\nShe never quite remembered what the talk was about.  Men were brought up and presented to her, and hung about her words, and sought to please her.  She had spoken her own thoughts, indifferent whether they expressed agreement or not; and the argument had invariably taken another plane.  It seemed so important that she should be convinced.  Some had succeeded, and had been strengthened.  Others had failed, and had departed sorrowful, conscious of the necessity of \\\"thinking it out again.\\\"\\n\\nGuests with other engagements were taking their leave.  A piquante little woman, outrageously but effectively dressed--she looked like a drawing by Beardsley--drew her aside.  \\\"I've always wished I were a man,\\\" she said.  \\\"It seemed to me that they had all the power. From this afternoon, I shall be proud of belonging to the governing sex.\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed and slipped away.\\n\\nPhillips was waiting for her in the vestibule.  She had forgotten him; but now she felt glad of his humble request to be allowed to see her home.  It would have been such a big drop from her crowded hour of triumph to the long lonely cab ride and the solitude of the hotel.  She resolved to be gracious, feeling a little sorry for her neglect of him--but reflecting with satisfaction that he had probably been watching her the whole time.\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter with my tie?\\\" he asked.  \\\"Wrong colour?\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed.  \\\"Yes,\\\" she answered.  \\\"It ought to be grey to match your suit.  And so ought your socks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't know it was going to be such a swell affair, or I shouldn't have come,\\\" he said.\\n\\nShe touched his hand lightly.\\n\\n\\\"I want you to get used to it,\\\" she said.  \\\"It's part of your work. Put your brain into it, and don't be afraid.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll try,\\\" he said.\\n\\nHe was sitting on the front seat, facing her.  \\\"I'm glad I went,\\\" he said with sudden vehemence.  \\\"I loved watching you, moving about among all those people.  I never knew before how beautiful you are.\\\"\\n\\nSomething in his eyes sent a slight thrill of fear through her.  It was not an unpleasant sensation--rather exhilarating.  She watched the passing street till she felt that his eyes were no longer devouring her.\\n\\n\\\"You're not offended?\\\" he asked.  \\\"At my thinking you beautiful?\\\" he added, in case she hadn't understood.\\n\\nShe laughed.  Her confidence had returned to her.  \\\"It doesn't generally offend a woman,\\\" she answered.\\n\\nHe seemed relieved.  \\\"That's what's so wonderful about you,\\\" he said.  \\\"I've met plenty of clever, brilliant women, but one could forget that they were women.  You're everything.\\\"\\n\\nHe pleaded, standing below her on the steps of the hotel, that she would dine with him.  But she shook her head.  She had her packing to do.  She could have managed it; but something prudent and absurd had suddenly got hold of her; and he went away with much the same look in his eyes that comes to a dog when he finds that his master cannot be persuaded into an excursion.\\n\\nShe went up to her room.  There really was not much to do.  She could quite well finish her packing in the morning.  She sat down at the desk and set to work to arrange her papers.  It was a warm spring evening, and the window was open.  A crowd of noisy sparrows seemed to be delighted about something.  From somewhere, unseen, a blackbird was singing.  She read over her report for Mrs. Denton. The blackbird seemed never to have heard of war.  He sang as if the whole world were a garden of languor and love.  Joan looked at her watch.  The first gong would sound in a few minutes.  She pictured the dreary, silent dining-room with its few scattered occupants, and her heart sank at the prospect.  To her relief came remembrance of a cheerful but entirely respectable restaurant near to the Louvre to which she had been taken a few nights before.  She had noticed quite a number of women dining there alone.  She closed her dispatch case with a snap and gave a glance at herself in the great mirror.  The blackbird was still singing.\\n\\nShe walked up the Rue des Sts. Peres, enjoying the delicious air. Half way across the bridge she overtook a man, strolling listlessly in front of her.  There was something familiar about him.  He was wearing a grey suit and had his hands in his pockets.  Suddenly the truth flashed upon her.  She stopped.  If he strolled on, she would be able to slip back.  Instead of which he abruptly turned to look down at a passing steamer, and they were face to face.\\n\\nIt made her mad, the look of delight that came into his eyes.  She could have boxed his ears.  Hadn't he anything else to do but hang about the streets.\\n\\nHe explained that he had been listening to the band in the gardens, returning by the Quai d'Orsay.\\n\\n\\\"Do let me come with you,\\\" he said.  \\\"I kept myself free this evening, hoping.  And I'm feeling so lonesome.\\\"\\n\\nPoor fellow!  She had come to understand that feeling.  After all, it wasn't altogether his fault that they had met.  And she had been so cross to him!\\n\\nHe was reading every expression on her face.\\n\\n\\\"It's such a lovely evening,\\\" he said.  \\\"Couldn't we go somewhere and dine under a tree?\\\"\\n\\nIt would be rather pleasant.  There was a little place at Meudon, she remembered.  The plane trees would just be in full leaf.\\n\\nA passing cab had drawn up close to them.  The chauffeur was lighting his pipe.\\n\\nEven Mrs. Grundy herself couldn't object to a journalist dining with a politician!\\n\\nThe stars came out before they had ended dinner.  She had made him talk about himself.  It was marvellous what he had accomplished with his opportunities.  Ten hours a day in the mines had earned for him his living, and the night had given him his leisure.  An attic, lighted by a tallow candle, with a shelf of books that left him hardly enough for bread, had been his Alma Mater.  History was his chief study.  There was hardly an authority Joan could think of with which he was not familiar.  Julius Caesar was his favourite play.  He seemed to know it by heart.  At twenty-three he had been elected a delegate, and had entered Parliament at twenty-eight.  It had been a life of hardship, of privation, of constant strain; but she found herself unable to pity him.  It was a tale of strength, of struggle, of victory, that he told her.\\n\\nStrength!  The shaded lamplight fell upon his fearless kindly face with its flashing eyes and its humorous mouth.  He ought to have been drinking out of a horn, not a wine glass that his well-shaped hand could have crushed by a careless pressure.  In a winged helmet and a coat of mail he would have looked so much more fitly dressed than in that soft felt hat and ridiculous blue tie.\\n\\nShe led him to talk on about the future.  She loved to hear his clear, confident voice with its touch of boyish boastfulness.  What was there to stop him?  Why should he not climb from power to power till he had reached the end!\\n\\nAnd as he talked and dreamed there grew up in her heart a fierce anger.  What would her own future be?  She would marry probably some man of her own class, settle down to the average woman's \\\"life\\\"; be allowed, like a spoilt child, to still \\\"take an interest\\\" in public affairs:  hold \\\"drawing-rooms\\\" attended by cranks and political nonentities:  be President, perhaps, of the local Woman's Liberal League.  The alternative:  to spend her days glued to a desk, penning exhortations to the people that Carleton and his like might or might not allow them to read; while youth and beauty slipped away from her, leaving her one of the ten thousand other lonely, faded women, forcing themselves unwelcome into men's jobs.  There came to her a sense of having been robbed of what was hers by primitive eternal law.  Greyson had been right.  She did love power--power to serve and shape the world.  She would have earned it and used it well.  She could have helped him, inspired him.  They would have worked together:  he the force and she the guidance.  She would have supplied the things he lacked.  It was to her he came for counsel, as it was.  But for her he would never have taken the first step.  What right had this poor brainless lump of painted flesh to share his wounds, his triumphs?  What help could she give him when the time should come that he should need it?\\n\\nSuddenly he broke off.  \\\"What a fool I'm making of myself,\\\" he said.  \\\"I always was a dreamer.\\\"\\n\\nShe forced a laugh.  \\\"Why shouldn't it come true?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nThey had the little garden to themselves.  The million lights of Paris shone below them.\\n\\n\\\"Because you won't be there,\\\" he answered, \\\"and without you I can't do it.  You think I'm always like I am to-night, bragging, confident.  So I am when you are with me.  You give me back my strength.  The plans and hopes and dreams that were slipping from me come crowding round me, laughing and holding out their hands. They are like the children.  They need two to care for them.  I want to talk about them to someone who understands them and loves them, as I do.  I want to feel they are dear to someone else, as well as to myself:  that I must work for them for her sake, as well as for my own.  I want someone to help me to bring them up.\\\"\\n\\nThere were tears in his eyes.  He brushed them angrily away.  \\\"Oh, I know I ought to be ashamed of myself,\\\" he said.  \\\"It wasn't her fault.  She wasn't to know that a hot-blooded young chap of twenty hasn't all his wits about him, any more than I was.  If I had never met you, it wouldn't have mattered.  I'd have done my bit of good, and have stopped there, content.  With you beside me\\\"--he looked away from her to where the silent city peeped through its veil of night--\\\"I might have left the world better than I found it.\\\"\\n\\nThe blood had mounted to her face.  She drew back into the shadow, beyond the tiny sphere of light made by the little lamp.\\n\\n\\\"Men have accomplished great things without a woman's help,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Some men,\\\" he answered.  \\\"Artists and poets.  They have the woman within them.  Men like myself--the mere fighter:  we are incomplete in ourselves.  Male and female created He them.  We are lost without our mate.\\\"\\n\\nHe was thinking only of himself.  Had he no pity for her.  So was she, also, useless without her mate.  Neither was she of those, here and there, who can stand alone.  Her task was that of the eternal woman:  to make a home:  to cleanse the world of sin and sorrow, make it a kinder dwelling-place for the children that should come.  This man was her true helpmeet.  He would have been her weapon, her dear servant; and she could have rewarded him as none other ever could.  The lamplight fell upon his ruddy face, his strong white hands resting on the flimsy table.  He belonged to an older order than her own.  That suggestion about him of something primitive, of something not yet altogether tamed.  She felt again that slight thrill of fear that so strangely excited her.  A mist seemed to be obscuring all things.  He seemed to be coming towards her.  Only by keeping her eyes fixed on his moveless hands, still resting on the table, could she convince herself that his arms were not closing about her, that she was not being drawn nearer and nearer to him, powerless to resist.\\n\\nSuddenly, out of the mist, she heard voices.  The waiter was standing beside him with the bill.  She reached out her hand and took it.  The usual few mistakes had occurred.  She explained them, good temperedly, and the waiter, with profuse apologies, went back to have it corrected.\\n\\nHe turned to her as the man went.  \\\"Try and forgive me,\\\" he said in a low voice.  \\\"It all came tumbling out before I thought what I was saying.\\\"\\n\\nThe blood was flowing back into her veins.  \\\"Oh, it wasn't your fault,\\\" she answered.  \\\"We must make the best we can of it.\\\"\\n\\nHe bent forward so that he could see into her eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Tell me,\\\" he said.  There was a note of fierce exultation in his voice.  \\\"I'll promise never to speak of it again.  If I had been a free man, could I have won you?\\\"\\n\\nShe had risen while he was speaking.  She moved to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders.\\n\\n\\\"Will you serve me and fight for me against all my enemies?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"So long as I live,\\\" he answered.\\n\\nShe glanced round.  There was no sign of the returning waiter.  She bent over him and kissed him.\\n\\n\\\"Don't come with me,\\\" she said.  \\\"There's a cab stand in the Avenue.  I shall walk to Sevres and take the train.\\\"\\n\\nShe did not look back.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nShe reached home in the evening.  The Phillips's old rooms had been twice let since Christmas, but were now again empty.  The McKean with his silent ways and his everlasting pipe had gone to America to superintend the production of one of his plays.  The house gave her the feeling of being haunted.  She had her dinner brought up to her and prepared for a long evening's work; but found herself unable to think--except on the one subject that she wanted to put off thinking about.  To her relief the last post brought her a letter from Arthur.  He had been called to Lisbon to look after a contract, and would be away for a fortnight.  Her father was not as well as he had been.\\n\\nIt seemed to just fit in.  She would run down and spend a few quiet days at Liverpool.  In her old familiar room where the moon peeped in over the tops of the tall pines she would be able to reason things out.  Perhaps her father would be able to help her.  She had lost her childish conception of him as of someone prim and proper, with cut and dried formulas for all occasions.  That glimpse he had shown her of himself had established a fellowship between them. He, too, had wrestled with life's riddles, not sure of his own answers.  She found him suffering from his old heart trouble, but more cheerful than she had known him for years.  Arthur seemed to be doing wonders with the men.  They were coming to trust him.\\n\\n\\\"The difficulty I have always been up against,\\\" explained her father, \\\"has been their suspicion.  'What's the cunning old rascal up to now?  What's his little game?'  That is always what I have felt they were thinking to themselves whenever I have wanted to do anything for them.  It isn't anything he says to them.  It seems to be just he, himself.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/111](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/111)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639210854,\"title\":\"She deserves the Croix de Guerre, if it is proved that she did it,\\\" he thought.  \\\"She will have saved many thousands of lives--for the present.\"},\"digest\":\"7P6fw_bwGZwdOr45YNp3Ki4hZMOtGDVHBRxNohm2nbc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x12DAB7FFceEebeDFF34FE12b77b7a16997723371\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rbrb8FXUJ-8DaMy7A2STo7R4QRsPoI9J2ngmbSqKx-Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f2PqIbq2il9RoMAnSYW8Q_Hth6lIXmwTcbsogYvNSzg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"11cI_mKVZuaF0QpDV04wERe3nhWoGIZIutYZpMVWyxROdqkg6qgTSSN8X7kpbd1pD5eVgoCnfkDFGqFdgxe9Fw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc3566d6207118a882bea5a325047add971c7e2d5dcd829d2afc55411c451bd0d31afdfa313fb00bb90b139e8d0199c57f59a32ea9e9bbbb42ca5c43df97c2c551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rbrb8FXUJ-8DaMy7A2STo7R4QRsPoI9J2ngmbSqKx-Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f2PqIbq2il9RoMAnSYW8Q_Hth6lIXmwTcbsogYvNSzg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7P6fw_bwGZwdOr45YNp3Ki4hZMOtGDVHBRxNohm2nbc\"}"
