"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Part Three — The Evening\\n\\n![Illustration by Ieva Berzina, aka xxzbat](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/70Uj2JaQ7cSbaogv7Kz8V.jpeg?height=2560&width=4000&&&&&size=large)\\n\\nI grabbed my backpack and went for a much-needed dip in the Melendiz, the river that runs through Ihlara Valley.\\n\\nAs the afternoon slowly dimmed into early evening, I figured this would be the best time to catch a ride to Nevşehir, the town where I aimed to find a place for the night. The heat was becoming more tolerable for hitchhiking, and my hope was to be picked up by visitors leaving the Valley.\\n\\nOne hour or so walking down by the stream turned the imposing canyon walls into subdue hills, and eventually, I found myself out of the Ihlara grounds, just at the entrance of a troglodyte village called Selime. The number of sightseers walking around was enthralling to me, at the time unaware that this was yet another tourist hotspot, one where you can find the largest religious edifice in Cappadocia.\\n\\nOblivious to the whole apparatus, I swiftly made my way through random blocks of people and shortly after found myself on the village outskirts, next to a strategically placed souvenir store that faced what seemed to be a national road.\\n\\nWhile inside the store asking for directions, a middle-aged man overheard me and presented himself as a tour agent. One look at me and he could tell I was not a potential customer, which he wisely acknowledged, in turn giving me the friendly smile that was all too familiar at this point.He explained his company had a minivan transfer for a group of tourists departing soon and there were seats available. The van was headed to Göreme, a nearby village to where I aimed to go. For a small fee, he’d ask the driver to drop me off.\\n\\nThe clock was close to the 6 pm mark, which meant both my chances and my will to hitch a ride were literally fading away by the minute, so I accepted the tour guy’s offer. He walked me out to the van, introducing me to the driver in Turkish.They asked me where was I staying for the night, to determine how much of a detour my drop off would entail. After explaining I had no accommodation booked, they suggested dropping me off at Göreme instead, together with the rest of the group, as according to them this town had many more lodgings on offer and was easier to navigate.\\n\\nGöreme was already in my plans for the next day, so I acquiesced. The tour group arrived minutes later, everyone boarded the van and we drove off at 6 pm sharp. Got to love a well-programmed tour.\\n\\nAs an obvious outsider who had just crashed their ride, I felt the odd stares all around. But it didn’t take long for conversation to be struck with the man next to me, a Dutch national who was no stranger to Turkey or Cappadocia.\\n\\nWe chatted about our origins and what brought us to that moment in time. He was a Buddhist devotee on holiday, trying to learn a bit more about the origins of Christianity in the region as part of his research for a project which had no final materialisation defined at the time. His demeanour was calm whilst assertive, like an old family member whom you respect and cherish at the same time.\\n\\nWe talked about Buddhism and our travels for a bit. The subject of my lack of accommodation eventually came up. Visibly on a tight budget, I mentioned trying to find a cheap hostel for the night. He deterred me:\\n\\n“I don’t think there are any hostels in Göreme, at least not the ones with dorms …it’s a bit expensive there, you’ll mostly find hotels and guest houses.”\\n\\nI mentioned sleeping rough on a couple of occasions during my time in Turkey and that I was ready to do it again if it came to it. He seemed astounded by my nonchalant reply:\\n\\n“Well, in that case, why not sleep inside one of the cave houses?”\\n\\n“I thought the government didn’t allow people to live there…”\\n\\n“Well nobody lives inside anymore, but the houses are still there. If you just walk out of town, into the mountains, you can see plenty of them carved around, you can just walk in.”\\n\\n“Are you sure?”\\n\\n“Just make sure you walk far out enough not to be disturbed. There are many houses in the valleys. I’m sure no one goes there at night.”\\n\\nThe minivan came to a halt shortly after. We all stepped out to a square surrounded by structures carved in monolithic stones — hoodoos they are called, or fairy chimneys. Hotels, shops, restaurants, local housing…all rock-cut or annexed to one of these big giants.\\n\\nEverything was beige, brown…or so it seemed under the early evening light. Unlike the sandy-white and mostly uninhabited Selime, in Göreme you could tell the construction inside the rock had been reinforced over the years with wood and concrete. The aesthetic was still troglodyte, but a closer look would inform you that people were living in modern times.\\n\\nI grabbed my rucksack from the trunk and said my goodbyes to the Dutchman. He wished me luck and pointed me in the right direction: a straight road shooting off out of town, with these pinkish hills in the background.\\n\\nIf I was going to spend the night as a hermit, I needed water and supplies. Images of a little fire pit popped up in my head. I bought canned sausages and a few other items from a local minimarket and made my way out of town, with the famous Cappadocia hills on the horizon and the sun slowly setting on my left.\\n\\n### Previous part:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa/yXk7Rc3Z1mcGWrFk87RgF37BC93Ln0cuInYo9DMY9d4](https://mirror.xyz/0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa/yXk7Rc3Z1mcGWrFk87RgF37BC93Ln0cuInYo9DMY9d4)\\n\\n### Next part:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa/6N1ahQc57lHYBwcrSETDa0fuYRSYkYS83F2oOTjpu2c](https://mirror.xyz/0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa/6N1ahQc57lHYBwcrSETDa0fuYRSYkYS83F2oOTjpu2c)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640772989,\"title\":\"That Time I Almost Died in Cappadocia (3/5)\"},\"digest\":\"ood4YT7Nb4zOc0ZhFarIfcP--d3OLapNtYWjeT0veEQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x778b5DeBb5127a7B6F87e28E7033Dd54F6d1Ffaa\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PwYaAPmavm8yMAX7NDWlZjQMI3dT_nl_CVyLhn3v6gQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w5ioO7jGlEOFm0c5fp9jhr7v32_sAjfTZY1Kn6dU7g8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mcHQSOCx8oR1QWJqYCoSWrpylf2xwXBAG8O8VkC8epzbY2K5kBLWQDsMlJUUd97KbFo4TzX0PBGqEpjdBx3Atw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5b8475ac802c007d3f3275bc5ca573854f06e88fe557476e8e02ee217667520d7202f18c98929aac75c363b83d952ff9bc2dacffa90719caa8e96d2956ee58671c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PwYaAPmavm8yMAX7NDWlZjQMI3dT_nl_CVyLhn3v6gQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w5ioO7jGlEOFm0c5fp9jhr7v32_sAjfTZY1Kn6dU7g8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1ByUvEMzQ30lvvTpcdfpqA3dK1zXQJ9x03Epy9r6yKc\"}"
