"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"With the development of the society and economy, various private schools arise. When you read newspapers, turn on TV, or even walk on the road, you will inevitably see lots of advertisements about private schools, mainly dealing with foreign languages, computers, music, sports, and so on. \\n \\n\\nHowever, is it a good or bad thing to have so many private schools? As a coin has two sides, so are the private schools. On the one hand, private schools can cater to the special need of the society and the special need of people. On the other hand, they often bring people extra burden because of comparison and competition.\\n\\nWere it left to me decide whether we should have a society without private schools or a society with private schools, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.   \",\"timestamp\":1640952092,\"title\":\"Private School\"},\"digest\":\"W07g6c7vvyhi-JiZQ_W4Wq_QZUKleTE393LTpTMcr4E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc3638F9368C8AB51672204E3AEE048c46360Dda7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aY47f5MX5vd4K5qPGK3RIB9Eg_CZpqf-GvLo2niCseo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y_T2gLvnZHjeABSvyUNidEZ-gUXLv7cnz8LZrshlvbw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"foCQ5SS0emMXDQ2WIqPYCtzny6mZobw3TVE_pVYJ8-Dr3Rxf3LB8ylk5herYkIdsMsIoQUPg_8BUSiJEqGK8oQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc00740c2b1e9f42f8b6509897a2d5bb52ebd87572822e9516466c99041b7bb07713096d1deaf8cd57578aa8fc67dc354da2d02577625a98c52ea0fc879b66d501b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"aY47f5MX5vd4K5qPGK3RIB9Eg_CZpqf-GvLo2niCseo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Y_T2gLvnZHjeABSvyUNidEZ-gUXLv7cnz8LZrshlvbw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"W07g6c7vvyhi-JiZQ_W4Wq_QZUKleTE393LTpTMcr4E\"}"
