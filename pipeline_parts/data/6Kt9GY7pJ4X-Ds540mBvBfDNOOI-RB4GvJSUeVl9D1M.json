"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"One of the earliest provocations at Mirror went a little like this: what if you had a great idea, and when telling the story introducing it to the world you could *also* enable the reader to participate in making that story *come to life*. What if that happened directly within the narrative as part of the story?\\n\\nThis scenario has informed our approach to interface since day one, and lead us to creating a series of *Economic Blocks*‚Äîembeddable interfaces you can place within a story enabling readers to interact by funding and sustaining great ideas. *To be active participants of the story being created.*\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6a6ce55c-ead2-4343-99ae-93568ffbd715.jpeg?height=1012&width=2024&hide=true)\\n\\nClearly there was something to this. We‚Äôre beginning to lose count of how many successful projects have taken place during Mirror‚Äôs first few months! Projects like Colin and Samir‚Äôs [NFT auction and split](https://colinandsamir.mirror.xyz/G5kD1SysIvVE-Socv7zknOExp3wZWZPSZ9_sxBj_cV4), Songcamp‚Äôs [auctions and splits for three original songs](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM), Emily‚Äôs [crowdfund for $NOVEL](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), and many more.\\n\\n![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/permalinks.svg?height=1012&width=2024&size=medium)\\n\\nThe economic blocks powering these projects have turned out to be just that‚Äî*very powerful.* Although they take form as focused embeddable blocks within stories, each contain much of the same functionality you‚Äôd expect from an *entire platform*. No joke!\\n\\nWith this in mind, we decided to give economic blocks permanent homes by creating **Permalinks**‚Äîdirect links to URLs where blocks are accessible outside of entries. You can discover a block‚Äôs permalink by clicking the üîó link icon in the a block heading. Auctions in particular look good! Here are a few favorite examples:\\n\\n- COPE‚Äôs [First Issue crowdfund and split](https://cope.mirror.xyz/crowdfunds/0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36)\\n- SongCamp‚Äôs [auction and split for an NFT](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/auctions/0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/3028)\\n- Visualize Value‚Äôs [split for the Infinite Players auction](https://mirror.xyz/splits/0xc811597463a2A5ec2dda2291fF3F35938dE48702)\\n\\nIn truth, this has been on our mind since day one, but overtime the idea was validated by seeing how blocks have been used by *you*. We‚Äôre excited to continue introducing other ideas up our sleeve. It‚Äôs easy to imagine how a design system of embeddable ‚Äúblocks‚Äù which represent expanded web3 ‚Äúapps‚Äù may evolve in the future. *Yes, we‚Äôre thinking about THAT thing you just thought of, too* üòâ\\n\\nOnwards!\",\"timestamp\":1620774441,\"title\":\"Introducing Block Permalinks\",\"publication\":\"jktest\"},\"digest\":\"-UGFYsXE7RrTo9zTUBQMaL9PrTL6GSRegNhwjIhGOqI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BwMOeSYPanA7vfLVrjkx_Hn-yihPsoDDjn1mBmI2SuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KCu6GKru7ORz-i1EpWsku16K1lZ38egx5Fm5-wwV-Z4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1DD_wcIvgBZd2KaEP1lcRemTXWqMDGQ5S1z2CVetWFYGIrnvvMjv6xfjK-c-buHDhFa4Mzf_C4YbmxclJ2Jqqg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x13c8cd7532a0227ad94187f35b5c2b871fdeff064faefbc58d47e78f3f927e6c0200dd7898497fb92f5d91d229cb943b98e5ed1c484f7f06b04be7150c9aa6111c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jktest.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BwMOeSYPanA7vfLVrjkx_Hn-yihPsoDDjn1mBmI2SuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KCu6GKru7ORz-i1EpWsku16K1lZ38egx5Fm5-wwV-Z4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8a229fd0939cf46675bfc68bb941a49203106713cfe3a0e79a9ba6e58bd1804d\"}"
