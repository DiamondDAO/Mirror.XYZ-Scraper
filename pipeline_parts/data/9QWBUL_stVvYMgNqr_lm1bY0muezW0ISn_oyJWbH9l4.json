"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"said\\nBearwarden.  \\\"I suggest that we investigate this further.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How?\\\" asked Cortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"By destroying its life,\\\" replied Bearwarden.  \\\"Give it one\\nbarrel from your gun, doctor, and see if it can then defy\\ngravitation.\\\"\\n\\nAccordingly Cortlandt took careful aim at the object, about\\ntwenty-yards away, and fired.  The main portion of the jellyfish,\\nwith the snake still in its embrace, sailed away, but many pounds\\nof jelly fell to the ground.  Most of this remained where it had\\nfallen, but a few of the larger pieces showed a faint luminosity\\nand rose again.\\n\\n\\\"You cannot kill that which is simply a mass of protoplasm,\\\" said\\nCortlandt.  \\\"Doubtless each of those pieces will form a new\\norganism.  This proves that there are ramifications and\\ndevelopments of life which we never dreamed of.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER VII.\\n\\n                    AN UNSEEN HUNTER.\\n```\\n\\nThey calculated that they had come ten or twelve miles from the\\nplace at which they built the raft, while the damp salt breeze\\nblowing from the south showed them they were near the ocean.\\nConcluding that large bodies of water must be very much alike on\\nall planets, they decided to make for a range of hills due north\\nand a few miles off, and to complete the circuit of the square in\\nreturning to the Callisto.  The soft wet sand was covered with\\nhuge and curious tracks, doubtless made by creatures that had\\ncome to the stream during the night to drink, and they noticed\\nwith satisfaction as they set out that the fresher ones led off\\nin the direction in which they were going.  For practice, they\\nblew off the heads of the boa-constrictors as they hung from the\\ntrees, and of the other huge snakes that moved along the ground,\\nwith explosive bullets, in every thicket through which they\\npassed, knowing that the game, never having been shot at, would\\nnot take fright at the noise.  Sometimes they came upon great\\nmasses of snakes, intertwined and coiled like worms; in these\\ncases Cortlandt brought his gun into play, raking them with\\nduck-shot to his heart's content.  \\\"As the function of these\\nreptiles,\\\" he explained, \\\"is to form a soil on which higher life\\nmay grow, we may as well help along their metamorphosis by\\nartificial means.\\\"  They were impressed by the tremendous\\ncannon-like reports of their firearms, which they perceived at\\nonce resulted from the great density of the Jovian atmosphere.\\nAnd this was also a considerable aid to them in making muscular\\nexertion, for it had just the reverse effect of rarefied mountain\\nair, and they seldom had to expand their lungs fully in order to\\nbreathe.\\n\\nThe ground continued to be marked with very large footprints.\\nOften the impressions were those of a biped like some huge bird,\\nexcept that occasionally the creature had put down one or both\\nforefeet, and a thick tail had evidently dragged nearly all the\\ntime it walked erect.  Presently, coming to something they had\\ntaken for a large flat rock, they were surprised to see it move.\\nIt was about twelve feet wide by eighteen feet long, while its\\nshell seemed at least a foot thick, and it was of course the\\nlargest turtle they had ever seen.\\n\\n\\\"Twenty-four people could dine at a table of this size with\\nease,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"while it would make soup for a regiment.\\nI wonder if it belongs to the snapping or diamond-backed\\nspecies.\\\"\\n\\nAt this juncture the monster again moved.\\n\\n\\\"As it is heading in our direction,\\\" resumed Bearwarden, \\\"I vote\\nwe strike for a free pass,\\\" and, taking a run, he sprang with his\\nspiked boots upon the turtle's shell and clambered upon the flat\\ntop, which was about six feet from the ground.  He was quickly\\nfollowed by Ayrault, who was not much ahead of Cortlandt, for,\\nnotwithstanding his fifty years, the professor was very spry.\\nThe tortoise was almost the exact counterpart of the Glyptodon\\nasper that formerly existed on earth, and shambled along at a\\njerky gait, about half as fast again as they could walk, and\\nwhile it continued to go in their direction they were greatly\\npleased.  They soon found that by dropping the butts of their\\nrifles sharply and simultaneously on either side, just back of\\nthe head, they could direct their course, by making their steed\\nswerve away from the stamping.\\n\\n\\\"It is strange,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"that, with the\\nexception of the mastodon and this tortoise, we have seen\\nnone of the monsters that seem to appear at the close of\\nCarboniferous periods, although the ground is covered\\nwith their tracks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Probably we did not reach the grounds at the right time of day,\\\"\\nreplied Bearwarden.  \\\"The large game doubtless stays in the woods\\nand jungles till night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I fancy,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"we shall find representatives of all\\nthe species that once lived upon the earth.  In the case of the\\nsinging flowers and the Jack-o'-lantern jelly-fish, we have, in\\naddition, seen developments the existence of which no scientist\\nhas ever before even suspected.\\\"\\n\\nOccasionally the tortoise stopped, whereupon they poked it from\\nbehind with their knives.  It was a vicious-looking brute, and\\nhad a huge horny beak, with which it bit off young trees that\\nstood in its way as though they had been blades of grass.  They\\nwere passing through a valley about half a mile wide, bordered on\\neach side by woods, when Bearwarden suddenly exclaimed, \\\"Here we\\nhave it!\\\" and, looking forward, they unexpectedly saw a head rise\\nand remain poised about fifteen feet from the ground.  It was a\\ndinosaur, and belonged to the scaled or armoured species.  In a\\nfew moments another head appeared, and towered several feet above\\nthe first.  The head was obviously reptilian, but had a beak\\nsimilar to that of their tortoise.  The hind legs were developed\\nlike those of a kangaroo, while the small rudimentary forepaws,\\nwhich could be used as hands or for going quadruped-fashion, now\\nhung down.  The strong thick tail was evidently of great use to\\nthem when standing erect, by forming a sort of tripod.\\n\\n\\\"How I wish we could take a pair of those creatures with us when\\nwe return to the earth!\\\" said Cortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"They would be trump cards,\\\" replied Bearwarden, \\\"in a zoological\\ngarden or a dime museum, and would take the wind out of the sails\\nof all the other freaks.\\\"\\n\\nAs they lay flat on the turtle's back, the monsters gazed at them\\nunconcernedly, munching the palm-tree fruit so loudly that they\\ncould be heard a long distance.\\n\\n\\\"Having nothing to fear from a tortoise,\\\" resumed Cortlandt,\\n\\\"they may allow us to stalk them.  We are in their eyes like\\nhippocentaurs, except that we are part of a tortoise instead of\\npart of a horse, or else they take us for a parasite or fibrous\\ngrowth on the shell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They would not have much to fear from us as we really are,\\\"\\nreplied Bearwarden, \\\"were it not for our explosive bullets.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am surprised,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"that graminivorous animals\\nshould be so heavily armed as these, since there can be no great\\nstruggle in obtaining their food.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From the looks of their jaws,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"I should say\\nthey are omnivorous, and would doubtless prefer meat to what they\\nare eating now.  Something seems to have gone wrong with the\\nanimal creation hereabouts to-day.\\\"\\n\\nTheir war-horse clanked along like a badly rusted machine,\\napproaching the dinosaurs obliquely.  When only about fifty yards\\nintervened, as the hunters were preparing to aim, their attention\\nwas diverted by a tremendous commotion in the woods on their left\\nand somewhat ahead.  With the crunching of dead branches and\\nswaying of the trees, a drove of monsters made a hasty exit and\\nsped across the open valley.  Some showed only the tops of their\\nbacks above the long grass, while others shambled and leaped with\\ntheir heads nearly thirty feet above the ground.  The dinosaurs\\ninstantly dropped on all-fours and joined in the flight, though\\nat about half-minute intervals they rose on their hind legs and\\nfor a few seconds ran erect.  The drove passed about half a mile\\nbefore the travellers, and made straight for the woods opposite;\\nbut hardly had the monsters been out of sight two minutes when\\nthey reappeared, even more precipitately than before, and fled up\\nthe valley in the same direction as the tortoise.\\n\\n\\\"The animals here,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"behave as though they were\\ngoing to catch a train; only our friend beneath us seems superior\\nto haste.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would give a good deal to know,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"what is\\npursuing those giants, and whether it is identical or similar to\\nthe mutilator of the mastodon.  Nothing but abject terror could\\nmake them run like that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have a well-formed idea,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"that a hunt is\\ngoing on, with no doubt two parties, one in the woods on either\\nside, and that the hunters may be on a scale commensurate with\\nthat of their victims.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If the excitement is caused by men,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"our\\nexploration may turn out to be a far more difficult undertaking\\nthan we anticipated.  But why, if there are men in those woods,\\ndo they not show themselves?--for they could certainly keep pace\\nwith the game more easily in the open than among the trees.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because,\\\" replied Bearwarden, \\\"the men in the woods are\\ndoubtless the beaters, whose duty it is to drive the game into\\nand up the valley, at the end of which the killing will be done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We may have a chance to see it,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"or to take a\\nhand, for we are travelling straight in that direction, and shall\\nbe able to give a good account ourselves if our rights are\\nchallenged.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why,\\\" asked Cortlandt, \\\"if the hunting parties that have been in\\nour vicinity were only beaters, should they have mutilated the\\nmastodon in such it way that he could not walk?  And how were\\nthey able to take themselves off so quickly--for man in his\\nnatural state has never been a fast mover?  I repeat, it will\\nupset my theories if we find men.\\\"\\n\\nIt was obvious to them that tortoises were not much troubled by\\nthe apparently general foe, for the specimen in which they were\\njust then interested continued his course entirely unconcerned.\\nSoon, however, he seemed to feel fatigue, for he drew his feet\\nand head within his shell, which he tightly closed, and after\\nthat no poking or prodding had the desired effect.\\n\\n\\\"I suspect we must depend on shank's mares for a time,\\\" said\\nBearwarden, cheerfully, as they scrambled down.\\n\\n\\\"We can now see,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"why our friend was so\\nunconcerned, since he has but to draw himself within himself to\\nbecome invulnerable to anything short of a stroke of lightning;\\nfor no bird could have power enough to raise and drop him from a\\ngreat height upon rocks, as the eagles do on earth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suspect, if anxious for turtle soup,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"we\\nmust attach a lightning--rod, and wait for a thunderstorm to\\nelectrocute him.\\\"\\n\\n```\\n                      CHAPTER VIII.\\n\\n                  SPORTSMEN'S REVERIES.\\n```\\n\\nFeeling grateful to the huge tortoise for the good service he had\\nrendered, they shot a number of the great snakes that were\\ngliding about on the ground, and placed them where he would find\\nthem on awaiting.  They then picked their way carefully towards\\nstretches on which the grass was shortest.  When they had gone\\nabout two miles, and had already reached higher ground, they came\\nto a ridge of rock running at right angles to their course.  This\\nthey climbed, and on looking over the edge of the crest beheld a\\nsight that made their hearts stand still.  A monster, somewhat\\nresembling an alligator, except that the back was arched, was\\nwaddling about perhaps seventy- five yards from them.  It was\\nsixty feet long, and to the top of its scales was at least\\ntwenty-five feet high.  It was constantly moving, and the\\ntravellers noticed with some dismay that its motion was far more\\nrapid than they would have supposed it could be.\\n\\n\\\"It is also a dinosaur,\\\" said the professor, watching it sharply,\\n\\\"and very closely resembles the Stegosaurus ungulatus restored in\\nthe museums.  The question is, What shall we do with the living\\nspecimen, now that we have it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Our chairman,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"must find a way to kill it, so\\nthat we may examine it closely.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The trouble is,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"our bullets will explode\\nbefore they penetrate the scales.  In the absence of any way of\\nmaking a passage for an explosive ball by means of a solid one,\\nwe must strike a vital spot.  His scales being no harder than the\\ntrunk of a tree, we can wound him terribly by touching him\\nanywhere; but there is no object in doing this unless we can kill\\nhim, especially as there is no deep stream, such as would have\\ndelayed the mastodon in reaching us, to protect us here.  We must\\nspread out so as to divert his attention from one to another.\\\"\\n\\nAfter some consultation it was decided that Cortlandt, who had\\nonly a shot-gun, should remain where they were, while Bearwarden\\nand Ayrault moved some distance to the right and left.  At a\\nsignal from Cortlandt, who was to attract the monster's\\nattention, the wings were to advance simultaneously.  These\\narrangements they carried out to the letter.  When Bearwarden and\\nAyrault had gone about twenty-five yards on either side, the\\ndoctor imitated the peculiar grunting sound of an alligator, at\\nwhich the colossal monster turned and faced him, while Bearwarden\\nand Ayrault moved to the attack.  The plan of this was good, for,\\nwith his attention fixed on three objects, the dinosaur seemed\\nconfused, and though Bearwarden and Ayrault had good angles from\\nwhich to shoot, there was no possibility of their hitting each\\nother.  They therefore advanced steadily with their rifles half\\nup.  Though their own danger increased with each step, in the\\nevent of their missing, the chance of their shooting wild\\ndecreased, the idea being to reach the brain through the eye.\\nCortlandt's part had also its risks, for, being entirely\\ndefenceless with his shot-gun against the large creature, whose\\nattention it was his duty to attract, he staked all on the\\nmarksmanship of his friends.  Not considering this, however, he\\nstood his ground, having the thumb-piece on his Winchester\\nmagazine shoved up and ready to make a noisy diversion if\\nnecessary in behalf of either wing.  Having aroused the monster's\\ncuriosity, Cortlandt sprang up, waving his arms and his gun.  The\\ndinosaur lowered his head as if to charge, thereby bringing it to\\na level with the rifles, either of which could have given it the\\nfatal shot.  But as their fingers pressed the triggers the\\nreptile soared up thirty feet in the air.  Ayrault pulled for his\\nfirst sight, shooting through the lower jaw, and shivering that\\nmember, while Bearwarden changed his aim and sighted straight for\\nthe heart.  In an instant the monster was down again, just\\nmissing Ayrault's head as he stepped back, and Bearwarden's rifle\\npoured a stream of explosive balls against its side, rending and\\nblowing away the heavy scales.  Having drawn the dinosaur's\\nattention to himself, he retreated, while Ayrault renewed the\\nattack.  Cortlandt, seeing that the original plan had miscarried,\\npoured showers of small shot against the huge beast's face.\\nFinally, one of Ayrault's balls exploded in the brain, and all\\nwas over.\\n\\n\\\"We have killed it at last,\\\" said Bearwarden \\\"but the first\\nattack, though artistic, had not the brilliant results we\\nexpected.  These creatures' mode of fighting is doubtless\\nsomewhat similar to that of the kangaroo, which it is said puts\\nits forepaws gently, almost lovingly, on a man's shoulders, and\\nthen disembowels him by the rapid movement of a hind leg.  But we\\nshall get used to their method, and can do better next time.\\\"\\n\\nThey then reloaded their weapons and, while Cortlandt examined\\ntheir victim from a naturalist's point of view, Bearwarden and\\nAyrault secured the heart, which they thought would be the most\\nedible part, the operation being rendered possible by the amount\\nof armour the explosive balls had stripped off.\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"we must make it a point to get\\nsome well-fed birds; for I can roast, broil, or fricassee them to\\na turn.  Life is too short to live on this meat in such a\\nsportsman's paradise.  In any case there can be no end of\\nmastodons, mammoths, woolly rhinoceroses, moa birds, and all such\\nshooting.\\\"\\n\\nAs the sun was already near the horizon, they chose a dry, sandy\\nplace, to secure as much immunity as possible from nocturnal\\nvisits, and, after procuring a supply of water from a pool,\\nproceeded to arrange their camp for the night.  They first laid\\nout the protection- wires, setting them while the sun still\\nshone.  Next they built a fire and prepared their evening meal.\\nWhile they ate it, twilight became night, and the fire-flies,\\ntwinkling in legions in the neighbouring valley, seemed like the\\nlamps of a great city.\\n\\n\\\"Their lights,\\\" said Bearwarden, pointing to them, \\\"are not as\\nfine as the jelly-fish Will-o'-the wisps were last night, but\\nthey are not so dangerous.  No gymnotus or electric eel that I\\nhave ever seen compared with them, and I am convinced that any\\none of us they might have touched would have been in kingdom\\ncome.\\\"\\n\\nThe balmy air soothed the travellers' brows as they reclined\\nagainst mounds of sand, while the flowers in the valley sent up\\ntheir dying notes.  One by one the moons arose, till four--among\\nthem the Lilliputian, discovered by Prof. Barnard in 1893--were\\nin the sky, flooding the landscape with their silvery light, and\\nsomething in the surroundings touched a sympathetic cord in the\\nmen.\\n\\n\\\"Oh that I were young again,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"and had life\\nbefore me!  I should like to remain here and grow up with this\\nplanet, in which we already perceive the next New World.  The\\nbeauties of earth are barren compared with the scenes we have\\nhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You remember,\\\" replied Bearwarden, \\\"how Cicero defends old age\\nin his De Senectute, and shows that while it has almost\\neverything that youth has, it has also a sense of calm and many\\nthings besides.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" answered Cortlandt, \\\"but, while plausible, it does not\\nconvince.  The pleasures of age are largely negative, the old\\nbeing happy when free from pain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Since the highest joy of life,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"is coming to know\\nour Creator, I should say the old, being further advanced, would\\nbe the happier of the two.  I should never regard this material\\nlife as greatly to be prized for itself.  You remember the old\\nsong:\\n\\\"'O Youth!  When we come to consider\\nThe pain, the toil, and the strife,\\nThe happiest man of all is\\nThe one who has finished his life.'\\n\\n\\\"I suspect,\\\" continued Ayrault, \\\"that the man who reaches even\\nthe lowest plane in paradise will find far more beautiful visions\\nthan any we have here.\\\"\\n\\nAs they had but little rest the night before, they were all\\ntired.  The warm breeze swayed the long dry grass, causing it to\\ngive out a soft rustle; all birds except the flitting bats were\\nasleep among the tall ferns or on the great trees that spread\\ntheir branches towards heaven.  There was nothing to recall a\\npicture of the huge monsters they had seen that day, or of the\\nstill more to be dreaded terror these had borne witness to.  Thus\\nnight closes the activities of the day, and in its serene\\ngrandeur the soul has time to think.  While they thought,\\nhowever, drowsiness overcame them, and in a little while all were\\nasleep.\\n\\nThe double line of protection-wires encircled them like a silent\\nguard, while the methodical ticking of the alarm-clock that was\\nto wake them at the approach of danger, and register the hour of\\ninterruption, formed a curious contrast to the irregular cries of\\nthe night-hawks in the distance.  Time and again some huge\\niguanodon or a hipsohopus would pass, shaking the ground with its\\ntread; but so implicit was the travellers' trust in the vigilance\\nof their mechanical and tireless watch, that they slept on as\\ncalmly and unconcernedly as though they had been in their beds at\\nhome, while the tick was as constant and regular as a sentry's\\nmarch.  The wires of course did not protect them from creatures\\nhaving wings, and they ran some risk of a visitation from the\\nblood-sucking bats.  The far-away volcanoes occasionally sent up\\nsheets of flame, which in the distance were like summer\\nlightning; the torrents of lava and crashes that had sounded so\\nthunderous when near, were now like the murmur of the ocean's ebb\\ntide, lulling the terrestrials to deeper sleep.  The pale moons\\nwere at intervals momentarily obscured by the rushing clouds in\\nthe upper air, only to reappear soon afterwards as serene as\\nbefore.  All Nature seemed at rest.\\n\\nShortly before dawn there was an unusually heavy step.  A moment\\nlater the ever-vigilant batteries poured forth their current, and\\nthe clang of the alarm-bell made the still night ring.  In an\\ninstant the three men were awake, each resting on one knee, with\\ntheir backs towards the centre and their polished barrels raised.\\nIt was not long before they perceived the intruder by the\\nmoonlight.  A huge monster of the Triceratops prorsus species had\\nentered the camp.  It was shaped something like an elephant, but\\nhad ten or twelve times the bulk, being over forty feet in\\nlength, not including the long, thick tail.  The head carried two\\nhuge horns on the forehead and one on the nose.\\n\\n\\\"A plague on my shot-gun!\\\" said Cortlandt.  \\\"Had I known how much\\nof this kind of game we should see, I too should have brought a\\nrifle.\\\"\\n\\nThe monster was entangled in the wires, and in another second\\nwould have stepped on the batteries that were still causing the\\nbell to ring.\\n\\n\\\"Aim for the heart,\\\" said Bearwarden to Ayrault.  \\\"When you show\\nme his ribs, I will follow you in the hole.\\\"\\n\\nAyrault instantly fired for a point just back of the left\\nforeleg.  The explosion had the same effect as on the mastodon,\\nremoving a half-barrel of hide, etc; and the next second\\nBearwarden sent a bullet less than an inch from where Ayrault's\\nhad stopped.  Before the colossus could turn, each had caused\\nseveral explosions in close proximity to the first.  The creature\\nwas of course terribly wounded, and several ribs were cracked,\\nbut no ball had gone through.  With a roar it made straight for\\nthe woods, and with surprising agility, running fully as fast as\\nan elephant.  Bearwarden and Ayrault kept up a rapid fire at the\\nleft hind leg, and soon completely disabled it.  The dinosaur,\\nhowever, supported itself with its huge tail, and continued to\\nmake good time.  Knowing they could not give it a fatal wound at\\nthe intervening distance, in the uncertain light, they stopped\\nfiring and set out in pursuit.  Cortlandt paused to stop the bell\\nthat still rang, and then put his best foot foremost in regaining\\nhis friends.  For half a mile they hurried along, until, seeing\\nby the quantity of blood on the ground that they were in no\\ndanger of losing the game, they determined to save their\\nstrength.  The trail entered the woods by a narrow ravine, passed\\nthrough what proved to be but a belt of timber, and then turned\\nnorth to the right.  Presently in the semi-darkness they saw the\\nmonster's head against the sky.  He was browsing among the trees,\\ntearing off the young branches, and the hunters succeeded in\\ngetting within seventy-five yards before being discovered.  Just\\nas he began to run, the two rifles again fired, this time at the\\nright hind leg, which they succeeded in hamstringing.  After that\\nthe Triceratops prorsus was at their mercy, and they quickly put\\nan end to its suffering.\\n\\n\\\"The sun is about to rise,\\\" said Bearwarden; \\\"in a few minutes we\\nshall have enough light.\\\"\\n\\nThey cut out a dozen thick slices of tenderloin steak, and soon\\nwere broiling and eating a substantial breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"There are not as many spectators to watch us eat here,\\\" said\\nCortlandt, \\\"as in the woods.  I suggest that, after returning to\\ncamp for our blankets and things, we steer for the Callisto, via\\nthis Triceratops, to see what creatures have been attracted by\\nthe body.\\\"\\n\\nOn finishing their meal they returned to the place at which they\\nhad passed the night.  Having straightened the protection-wires,\\nwhich had become twisted, and arranged their impedimenta, they\\nset out, and were soon once more beside their latest victim.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER IX.\\n\\n                   THE HONEY OF DEATH.\\n```\\n\\nAt first nothing seemed to have been disturbed, when they\\nsuddenly perceived that both forelegs were missing.  On further\\nexamination they found that the ponderous tail, seven feet in\\ndiameter, was cut through in two places, the thicker portion\\nhaving disappeared, and that the heavy bones in this extremity of\\nthe vertebral column had been severed like straws.  The cut\\nsurfaces were but little cooler than the interior of the body,\\nshowing how recently the mutilation had been effected.\\n\\n\\\"By all the gods!\\\" exclaimed Bearwarden, \\\"it is easy to see the\\nmethod in this; the hunters have again cut off only those parts\\nthat could be easily rolled.  These Jovian fellows must have\\nweapons compared with which the old scythe chariots would be but\\ntoys, with which they amputate the legs of their victims.  We\\nmust see to it that their scimitars do not come too near to us,\\nand I venture to hope that in our bullets they will find their\\nmatch.
