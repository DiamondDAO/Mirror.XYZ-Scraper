"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\\[The room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests.  At the top of the staircase stands LADY CHILTERN, a woman of grave Greek beauty, about twenty-seven years of age.  She receives the guests as they come up.  Over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax lights, which illumine a large eighteenth-century French tapestry - representing the Triumph of Love, from a design by Boucher - that is stretched on the staircase wall.  On the right is the entrance to the music-room.  The sound of a string quartette is faintly heard.  The entrance on the left leads to other reception- rooms.  MRS. MARCHMONT and LADY BASILDON, two very pretty women, are seated together on a Louis Seize sofa.  They are types of exquisite fragility.  Their affectation of manner has a delicate charm. Watteau would have loved to paint them.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Going on to the Hartlocks' to-night, Margaret?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  I suppose so.  Are you?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Yes.  Horribly tedious parties they give, don't they?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Horribly tedious!  Never know why I go.  Never know why I go anywhere.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  I come here to be educated\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Ah!  I hate being educated!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  So do I.  It puts one almost on a level with the commercial classes, doesn't it?  But dear Gertrude Chiltern is always telling me that I should have some serious purpose in life.  So I come here to try to find one.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Looking round through her lorgnette.\\\\]  I don't see anybody here to-night whom one could possibly call a serious purpose. The man who took me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole time.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  How very trivial of him!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Terribly trivial!  What did your man talk about?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  About myself.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Languidly.\\\\]  And were you interested?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Shaking her head.\\\\]  Not in the smallest degree.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  What martyrs we are, dear Margaret!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Rising.\\\\]  And how well it becomes us, Olivia!\\n\\n\\\\[They rise and go towards the music-room.  The VICOMTE DE NANJAC, a young attache known for his neckties and his Anglomania, approaches with a low bow, and enters into conversation.\\\\]\\n\\nMASON.  \\\\[Announcing guests from the top of the staircase.\\\\]  Mr. and Lady Jane Barford.  Lord Caversham.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter LORD CAVERSHAM, an old gentleman of seventy, wearing the riband and star of the Garter.  A fine Whig type.  Rather like a portrait by Lawrence.\\\\]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Good evening, Lady Chiltern!  Has my good-for- nothing young son been here?\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \\\\[Smiling.\\\\]  I don't think Lord Goring has arrived yet.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \\\\[Coming up to LORD CAVERSHAM.\\\\]  Why do you call Lord Goring good-for-nothing?\\n\\n\\\\[MABEL CHILTERN is a perfect example of the English type of prettiness, the apple-blossom type.  She has all the fragrance and freedom of a flower.  There is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair, and the little mouth, with its parted lips, is expectant, like the mouth of a child.  She has the fascinating tyranny of youth, and the astonishing courage of innocence.  To sane people she is not reminiscent of any work of art.  But she is really like a Tanagra statuette, and would be rather annoyed if she were told so.\\\\]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Because he leads such an idle life.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How can you say such a thing?  Why, he rides in the Row at ten o'clock in the morning, goes to the Opera three times a week, changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night of the season.  You don't call that leading an idle life, do you?\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  \\\\[Looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes.\\\\] You are a very charming young lady!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How sweet of you to say that, Lord Caversham!  Do come to us more often.  You know we are always at home on Wednesdays, and you look so well with your star!\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Never go anywhere now.  Sick of London Society. Shouldn't mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the right side.  But object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my wife's milliner.  Never could stand Lady Caversham's bonnets.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I love London Society!  I think it has immensely improved.  It is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant lunatics.  Just what Society should be.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Hum!  Which is Goring?  Beautiful idiot, or the other thing?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \\\\[Gravely.\\\\]  I have been obliged for the present to put Lord Goring into a class quite by himself.  But he is developing charmingly!\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Into what?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \\\\[With a little curtsey.\\\\]  I hope to let you know very soon, Lord Caversham!\\n\\nMASON.  \\\\[Announcing guests.\\\\]  Lady Markby.  Mrs. Cheveley.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter LADY MARKBY and MRS. CHEVELEY.  LADY MARKBY is a pleasant, kindly, popular woman, with gray hair e la marquise and good lace. MRS. CHEVELEY, who accompanies her, is tall and rather slight.  Lips very thin and highly-coloured, a line of scarlet on a pallid face. Venetian red hair, aquiline nose, and long throat.  Rouge accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion.  Gray-green eyes that move restlessly.  She is in heliotrope, with diamonds.  She looks rather like an orchid, and makes great demands on one's curiosity.  In all her movements she is extremely graceful.  A work of art, on the whole, but showing the influence of too many schools.\\\\]\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Good evening, dear Gertrude!  So kind of you to let me bring my friend, Mrs. Cheveley.  Two such charming women should know each other!\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \\\\[Advances towards MRS. CHEVELEY with a sweet smile. Then suddenly stops, and bows rather distantly.\\\\]  I think Mrs. Cheveley and I have met before.  I did not know she had married a second time.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  \\\\[Genially.\\\\]  Ah, nowadays people marry as often as they can, don't they?  It is most fashionable.  \\\\[To DUCHESS OF MARYBOROUGH.\\\\]  Dear Duchess, and how is the Duke?  Brain still weak, I suppose?  Well, that is only to be expected, is it not?  His good father was just the same.  There is nothing like race, is there?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \\\\[Playing with her fan.\\\\]  But have we really met before, Lady Chiltern?  I can't remember where.  I have been out of England for so long.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  We were at school together, Mrs. Cheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY \\\\[Superciliously.\\\\]  Indeed?  I have forgotten all about my schooldays.  I have a vague impression that they were detestable.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  \\\\[Coldly.\\\\]  I am not surprised!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \\\\[In her sweetest manner.\\\\]  Do you know, I am quite looking forward to meeting your clever husband, Lady Chiltern.  Since he has been at the Foreign Office, he has been so much talked of in Vienna.  They actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  That in itself is fame, on the continent.\\n\\nLADY CHILTERN.  I hardly think there will be much in common between you and my husband, Mrs. Cheveley!  \\\\[Moves away.\\\\]\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Ah! chere Madame, queue surprise!  I have not seen you since Berlin!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Not since Berlin, Vicomte.  Five years ago!\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  And you are younger and more beautiful than ever. How do you manage it?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  By making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming people like yourself.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Ah! you flatter me.  You butter me, as they say here.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Do they say that here?  How dreadful of them!\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  Yes, they have a wonderful language.  It should be more widely known.\\n\\n\\\\[SIR ROBERT CHILTERN enters.  A man of forty, but looking somewhat younger.  Clean-shaven, with finely-cut features, dark-haired and dark-eyed.  A personality of mark.  Not popular - few personalities are.  But intensely admired by the few, and deeply respected by the many.  The note of his manner is that of perfect distinction, with a slight touch of pride.  One feels that he is conscious of the success he has made in life.  A nervous temperament, with a tired look.  The firmly-chiselled mouth and chin contrast strikingly with the romantic expression in the deep-set eyes.  The variance is suggestive of an almost complete separation of passion and intellect, as though thought and emotion were each isolated in its own sphere through some violence of will-power.  There is nervousness in the nostrils, and in the pale, thin, pointed hands.  It would be inaccurate to call him picturesque.  Picturesqueness cannot survive the House of Commons. But Vandyck would have liked to have painted his head.\\\\]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, Lady Markby!  I hope you have brought Sir John with you?\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Oh!  I have brought a much more charming person than Sir John.  Sir John's temper since he has taken seriously to politics has become quite unbearable.  Really, now that the House of Commons is trying to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope not, Lady Markby.  At any rate we do our best to waste the public time, don't we?  But who is this charming person you have been kind enough to bring to us?\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Her name is Mrs. Cheveley!  One of the Dorsetshire Cheveleys, I suppose.  But I really don't know.  Families are so mixed nowadays.  Indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Mrs. Cheveley?  I seem to know the name.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  She has just arrived from Vienna.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Ah! yes.  I think I know whom you mean.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant scandals about all her friends.  I really must go to Vienna next winter.  I hope there is a good chef at the Embassy.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  If there is not, the Ambassador will certainly have to be recalled.  Pray point out Mrs. Cheveley to me.  I should like to see her.\\n\\nLADY MARKBY.  Let me introduce you.  \\\\[To MRS. CHEVELEY.\\\\]  My dear, Sir Robert Chiltern is dying to know you!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[Bowing.\\\\]  Every one is dying to know the brilliant Mrs. Cheveley.  Our attaches at Vienna write to us about nothing else.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thank you, Sir Robert.  An acquaintance that begins with a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  It starts in the right manner.  And I find that I know Lady Chiltern already.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Really?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Yes.  She has just reminded me that we were at school together.  I remember it perfectly now.  She always got the good conduct prize.  I have a distinct recollection of Lady Chiltern always getting the good conduct prize!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[Smiling.\\\\]  And what prizes did you get, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  My prizes came a little later on in life.  I don't think any of them were for good conduct.  I forget!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am sure they were for something charming!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I don't know that women are always rewarded for being charming.  I think they are usually punished for it!  Certainly, more women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than through anything else!  At least that is the only way I can account for the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in London!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What an appalling philosophy that sounds!  To attempt to classify you, Mrs. Cheveley, would be an impertinence. But may I ask, at heart, are you an optimist or a pessimist?  Those seem to be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I'm neither.  Optimism begins in a broad grin, and Pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  Besides, they are both of them merely poses.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You prefer to be natural?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  But it is such a very difficult pose to keep up.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What would those modern psychological novelists, of whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that psychology cannot explain us.  Men can be analysed, women . . . merely adored.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You think science cannot grapple with the problem of women?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Science can never grapple with the irrational.  That is why it has no future before it, in this world.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And women represent the irrational.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Well-dressed women do.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[With a polite bow.\\\\]  I fear I could hardly agree with you there.  But do sit down.  And now tell me, what makes you leave your brilliant Vienna for our gloomy London - or perhaps the question is indiscreet?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Questions are never indiscreet.  Answers sometimes are.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Well, at any rate, may I know if it is politics or pleasure?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Politics are my only pleasure.  You see nowadays it is not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  And philanthropy seems to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy their fellow-creatures.  I prefer politics.  I think they are more . . . becoming!\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  A political life is a noble career!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Sometimes.  And sometimes it is a clever game, Sir Robert.  And sometimes it is a great nuisance.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Which do you find it?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I?  A combination of all three.  \\\\[Drops her fan.\\\\]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[Picks up fan.\\\\]  Allow me!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Thanks.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  But you have not told me yet what makes you honour London so suddenly.  Our season is almost over.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh! I don't care about the London season!  It is too matrimonial.  People are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from them.  I wanted to meet you.  It is quite true.  You know what a woman's curiosity is.  Almost as great as a man's!  I wanted immensely to meet you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I hope it is not a little thing, Mrs. Cheveley. I find that little things are so very difficult to do.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \\\\[After a moment's reflection.\\\\]  No, I don't think it is quite a little thing.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  I am so glad.  Do tell me what it is.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Later on.  \\\\[Rises.\\\\]  And now may I walk through your beautiful house?  I hear your pictures are charming.  Poor Baron Arnheim - you remember the Baron? - used to tell me you had some wonderful Corots.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[With an almost imperceptible start.\\\\]  Did you know Baron Arnheim well?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  \\\\[Smiling.\\\\]  Intimately.  Did you?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  At one time.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Wonderful man, wasn't he?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[After a pause.\\\\]  He was very remarkable, in many ways.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I often think it such a pity he never wrote his memoirs.  They would have been most interesting.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes:  he knew men and cities well, like the old Greek.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Without the dreadful disadvantage of having a Penelope waiting at home for him.\\n\\nMASON.  Lord Goring.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter LORD GORING.  Thirty-four, but always says he is younger.  A well-bred, expressionless face.  He is clever, but would not like to be thought so.  A flawless dandy, he would be annoyed if he were considered romantic.  He plays with life, and is on perfectly good terms with the world.  He is fond of being misunderstood.  It gives him a post of vantage.\\\\]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Good evening, my dear Arthur!  Mrs. Cheveley, allow me to introduce to you Lord Goring, the idlest man in London.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I have met Lord Goring before.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \\\\[Bowing.\\\\]  I did not think you would remember me, Mrs. Cheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  My memory is under admirable control.  And are you still a bachelor?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I . . . believe so.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  How very romantic!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh!  I am not at all romantic.  I am not old enough.  I leave romance to my seniors.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Lord Goring is the result of Boodle's Club, Mrs. Cheveley.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  He reflects every credit on the institution.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  May I ask are you staying in London long?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  That depends partly on the weather, partly on the cooking, and partly on Sir Robert.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  You are not going to plunge us into a European war, I hope?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  There is no danger, at present!\\n\\n\\\\[She nods to LORD GORING, with a look of amusement in her eyes, and goes out with SIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  LORD GORING saunters over to MABEL CHILTERN.\\\\]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You are very late!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Have you missed me?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Awfully!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then I am sorry I did not stay away longer.  I like being missed.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How very selfish of you!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I am very selfish.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You are always telling me of your bad qualities, Lord Goring.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I have only told you half of them as yet, Miss Mabel!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Are the others very bad?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Quite dreadful!  When I think of them at night I go to sleep at once.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I delight in your bad qualities.  I wouldn't have you part with one of them.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How very nice of you!  But then you are always nice. By the way, I want to ask you a question, Miss Mabel.  Who brought Mrs. Cheveley here?  That woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the room with your brother?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Oh, I think Lady Markby brought her.  Why do you ask?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I haven't seen her for years, that is all.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  What an absurd reason!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  All reasons are absurd.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  What sort of a woman is she?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  I dislike her already.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  That shows your admirable good taste.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  \\\\[Approaching.\\\\]  Ah, the English young lady is the dragon of good taste, is she not?  Quite the dragon of good taste.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  So the newspapers are always telling us.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I read all your English newspapers.  I find them so amusing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Then, my dear Nanjac, you must certainly read between the lines.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I should like to, but my professor objects.  \\\\[To MABEL CHILTERN.\\\\]  May I have the pleasure of escorting you to the music-room, Mademoiselle?\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \\\\[Looking very disappointed.\\\\]  Delighted, Vicomte, quite delighted!  \\\\[Turning to LORD GORING.\\\\]  Aren't you coming to the music-room?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Not if there is any music going on, Miss Mabel.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  \\\\[Severely.\\\\]  The music is in German.  You would not understand it.\\n\\n\\\\[Goes out with the VICOMTE DE NANJAC.  LORD CAVERSHAM comes up to his son.\\\\]\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir! what are you doing here?  Wasting your life as usual!  You should be in bed, sir.  You keep too late hours! I heard of you the other night at Lady Rufford's dancing till four o'clock in the morning!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Only a quarter to four, father.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  Can't make out how you stand London Society.  The thing has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I love talking about nothing, father.  It is the only thing I know anything about.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You seem to me to be living entirely for pleasure.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  What else is there to live for, father?  Nothing ages like happiness.\\n\\nLORD CAVERSHAM.  You are heartless, sir, very heartless!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I hope not, father.  Good evening, Lady Basildon!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Arching two pretty eyebrows.\\\\]  Are you here?  I had no idea you ever came to political parties!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I adore political parties.  They are the only place left to us where people don't talk politics.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  I delight in talking politics.  I talk them all day long.  But I can't bear listening to them.  I don't know how the unfortunate men in the House stand these long debates.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  By never listening.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Really?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \\\\[In his most serious manner.\\\\]  Of course.  You see, it is a very dangerous thing to listen.  If one listens one may be convinced; and a man who allows himself to be convinced by an argument is a thoroughly unreasonable person.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Ah! that accounts for so much in men that I have never understood, and so much in women that their husbands never appreciate in them!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[With a sigh.\\\\]  Our husbands never appreciate anything in us.  We have to go to others for that!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Emphatically.\\\\]  Yes, always to others, have we not?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  \\\\[Smiling.\\\\]  And those are the views of the two ladies who are known to have the most admirable husbands in London.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  That is exactly what we can't stand.  My Reginald is quite hopelessly faultless.  He is really unendurably so, at times! There is not the smallest element of excitement in knowing him.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How terrible!  Really, the thing should be more widely known!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Basildon is quite as bad; he is as domestic as if he was a bachelor.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Pressing LADY BASILDON'S hand.\\\\]  My poor Olivia! We have married perfect husbands, and we are well punished for it.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I should have thought it was the husbands who were punished.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Drawing herself up.\\\\]  Oh, dear no!  They are as happy as possible!  And as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust us.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Perfectly tragic!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Or comic, Lady Basildon?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Certainly not comic, Lord Goring.  How unkind of you to suggest such a thing!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  I am afraid Lord Goring is in the camp of the enemy, as usual.  I saw him talking to that Mrs. Cheveley when he came in.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Handsome woman, Mrs. Cheveley!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Stiffly.\\\\]  Please don't praise other women in our presence.  You might wait for us to do that!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I did wait.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Well, we are not going to praise her.  I hear she went to the Opera on Monday night, and told Tommy Rufford at supper that, as far as she could see, London Society was entirely made up of dowdies and dandies.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  She is quite right, too.  The men are all dowdies and the women are all dandies, aren't they?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[After a pause.\\\\]  Oh! do you really think that is what Mrs. Cheveley meant?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Of course.  And a very sensible remark for Mrs. Cheveley to make, too.\\n\\n\\\\[Enter MABEL CHILTERN.  She joins the group.\\\\]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Why are you talking about Mrs. Cheveley?  Everybody is talking about Mrs. Cheveley!  Lord Goring says - what did you say, Lord Goring, about Mrs. Cheveley?  Oh!  I remember, that she was a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  What a horrid combination!  So very unnatural!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[In her most dreamy manner.\\\\]  I like looking at geniuses, and listening to beautiful people.\\n\\nLORD GORING.  Ah! that is morbid of you, Mrs. Marchmont!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Brightening to a look of real pleasure.\\\\]  I am to glad to hear you say that.  Marchmont and I have been married for seven years, and he has never once told me that I was morbid.  Men are so painfully unobservant!\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Turning to her.\\\\]  I have always said, dear Margaret, that you were the most morbid person in London.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Ah! but you are always sympathetic, Olivia!\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Is it morbid to have a desire for food?  I have a great desire for food.  Lord Goring, will you give me some supper?\\n\\nLORD GORING.  With pleasure, Miss Mabel.  \\\\[Moves away with her.\\\\]\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  How horrid you have been!  You have never talked to me the whole evening!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  How could I?  You went away with the child-diplomatist.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  You might have followed us.  Pursuit would have been only polite.  I don't think I like you at all this evening!\\n\\nLORD GORING.  I like you immensely.\\n\\nMABEL CHILTERN.  Well, I wish you'd show it in a more marked way! \\\\[They go downstairs.\\\\]\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Olivia, I have a curious feeling of absolute faintness.  I think I should like some supper very much.  I know I should like some supper.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  I am positively dying for supper, Margaret!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these things.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  Men are grossly material, grossly material!\\n\\n\\\\[The VICOMTE DE NANJAC enters from the music-room with some other guests.  After having carefully examined all the people present, he approaches LADY BASILDON.\\\\]\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  May I have the honour of taking you down to supper, Comtesse?\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  \\\\[Coldly.\\\\]  I never take supper, thank you, Vicomte. \\\\[The VICOMTE is about to retire.  LADY BASILDON, seeing this, rises at once and takes his arm.\\\\]  But I will come down with you with pleasure.\\n\\nVICOMTE DE NANJAC.  I am so fond of eating!  I am very English in all my tastes.\\n\\nLADY BASILDON.  You look quite English, Vicomte, quite English.\\n\\n\\\\[They pass out.  MR. MONTFORD, a perfectly groomed young dandy, approaches MRS. MARCHMONT.\\\\]\\n\\nMR. MONTFORD.  Like some supper, Mrs. Marchmont?\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Languidly.\\\\]  Thank you, Mr. Montford, I never touch supper.  \\\\[Rises hastily and takes his arm.\\\\]  But I will sit beside you, and watch you.\\n\\nMR. MONTFORD.  I don't know that I like being watched when I am eating!\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  Then I will watch some one else.\\n\\nMR. MONTFORD.  I don't know that I should like that either.\\n\\nMRS. MARCHMONT.  \\\\[Severely.\\\\]  Pray, Mr. Montford, do not make these painful scenes of jealousy in public!\\n\\n\\\\[They go downstairs with the other guests, passing SIR ROBERT CHILTERN and MRS. CHEVELEY, who now enter.\\\\]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  And are you going to any of our country houses before you leave England, Mrs. Cheveley?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, no!  I can't stand your English house-parties. In England people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  That is so dreadful of them!  Only dull people are brilliant at breakfast. And then the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  My stay in England really depends on you, Sir Robert.  \\\\[Sits down on the sofa.\\\\]\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  \\\\[Taking a seat beside her.\\\\]  Seriously?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Quite seriously.  I want to talk to you about a great political and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  What a tedious, practical subject for you to talk about, Mrs. Cheveley!\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Oh, I like tedious, practical subjects.  What I don't like are tedious, practical people.  There is a wide difference. Besides, you are interested, I know, in International Canal schemes. You were Lord Radley's secretary, weren't you, when the Government bought the Suez Canal shares?\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Yes.  But the Suez Canal was a very great and splendid undertaking.  It gave us our direct route to India.  It had imperial value.  It was necessary that we should have control.  This Argentine scheme is a commonplace Stock Exchange swindle.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  A speculation, Sir Robert!  A brilliant, daring speculation.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Believe me, Mrs. Cheveley, it is a swindle. Let us call things by their proper names.  It makes matters simpler. We have all the information about it at the Foreign Office.  In fact, I sent out a special Commission to inquire into the matter privately, and they report that the works are hardly begun, and as for the money already subscribed, no one seems to know what has become of it.  The whole thing is a second Panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that miserable affair ever had.  I hope you have not invested in it.  I am sure you are far too clever to have done that.\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  I have invested very largely in it.\\n\\nSIR ROBERT CHILTERN.  Who could have advised you to do such a foolish thing?\\n\\nMRS. CHEVELEY.  Your old friend - and mine.\",\"timestamp\":1639291313,\"title\":\"The octagon room at Sir Robert Chiltern's house in Grosvenor Square.\"},\"digest\":\"AdC7AWcUMktJ-gGfDD426jR_9GYsxfpCY_ocJHv_U2c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF165065007e6A50f160Ee022853535F41771C1a6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oBh7JKRPie5oCAEgUER9b5Y1aesdrpBobFPgCqLFYDU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xQYY8zMHeEo97-SEzB36waNqbUPFkXuTkuVrszN4kZ4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8Vsg30BWaKryokqt2iupWU-i7GtReSyme7mKlX6JSSrkYMxzKHlUyRuQitEtSge6JVm1L3-Cpd-2YmsFAtzRxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfa934ae8f4b42bc1c6094a32b6fd44819860bddfd399682c8c6cde13d7d4932b46b5c7b3c173ccb9195d392841cf58726ed0f5b4325bf472476d94f83da1684b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"oBh7JKRPie5oCAEgUER9b5Y1aesdrpBobFPgCqLFYDU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xQYY8zMHeEo97-SEzB36waNqbUPFkXuTkuVrszN4kZ4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AdC7AWcUMktJ-gGfDD426jR_9GYsxfpCY_ocJHv_U2c\"}"
