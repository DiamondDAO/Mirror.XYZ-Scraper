"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Monetization of publicly accessible written content has never had a strong basis on the internet, since it suffers from the [public goods](https://wikipedia.com) problem. As publishing has moved online, funding for high-quality, long-form writing has broken down.\\n\\nNFTs give us new tools to solve this problem — by a representing previously infinitely reproducible creative works as scarce, tradable digital assets. This means that artists can now sell a scarce digital asset representing an essay as a unique collectible or artwork, while the content itself remains open and freely accessible (a public good). Still, the problem remains for funding the time and work necessary for a creator to produce impactful writing.\\n\\n```js\\ncontract Crowdfund is ERC20 {\\n    using SafeMath for uint256;\\n\\n    // A list of possible states for crowd-funding.\\n    enum Status {FUNDING, TRADING}\\n    // The actual status of the crowd-fund, one of `Status`.\\n    Status internal _status;\\n\\n    // Events representing crowdfunding life-cycle.\\n    event FundingOpened(address media, address creator, uint256 creatorEquityPercent);\\n    event Contribution(address contributor, uint256 amount);\\n    event FundingClosed(uint256 amountRaised, uint256 creatorAllocation);\\n    event BidAccepted(uint256 amount);\\n    event Withdrawal(address contributor, uint256 amount);\\n```\\n\\n### Implementation Summary\\n- There is an ERC20-compatible contract that mints and owns an NFT upon deployment\\n- The contract can have an owner, but the owner cannot mint() tokens — we might call this an operator. The operator can accept bids on the NFT, and can simultaneously close funding and withdraw the funds that were raised.\\n- Contributors are able to send funds (e.g. ETH) to the contract in exchange for a proportional ownership stake in the future work.\\n- Contributors are able to exit by using a method that burns their equity tokens and sends them their funds (initial contribution + profits)\\n- The contract has a \\\"hard cap\\\", beyond which nobody else can join the crowdfund.\\n- This limits the original valuation for the NFT to something less than the expected profitability, limits exploitation of vulnerabilities, and also creates some scarcity around being part of the funding opportunity.\\n- The downside is that one person might just buy all of it, which is less fun.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1611200432,\"title\":\"Testing themes\",\"publication\":\"d\"},\"digest\":\"OF0aha9hfewQ_dxYByOQJ_SJhRS-a31pMMeP7IukoBA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5507dbd48a5A5bAcE8a6030e878cC4E0af147C33\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ou-dt8gfWIFv4DZCJzYTfTfFi5OfrTEEJH6PitXhIYw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1Vm1TTb2FyA5xiQX-_alMPD1QUEkNR4KTgSmIkZI8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hDvM76oAyjBSeQ-eDRNKgyHSp3usNtE6jMaEy86Il9QcUnIqoSLW1N4d4_alz3Gyh6wNWpWUW272iKb1rJ1lSQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4474c759029f7333b7665425bf96c19f8da8a105e8cbbaa771b22032c9ad737049da7027509d953a87066f861fe2366659cdb943cbf6491ceea9fafedf3821301c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on d.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ou-dt8gfWIFv4DZCJzYTfTfFi5OfrTEEJH6PitXhIYw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1Vm1TTb2FyA5xiQX-_alMPD1QUEkNR4KTgSmIkZI8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CJprE9nq6ok7v5Xc7XJ6Puhsb2N0mS2hv3is0qvSuuU\"}"
