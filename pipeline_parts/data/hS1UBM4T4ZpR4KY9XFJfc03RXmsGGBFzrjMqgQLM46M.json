"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have been researching mirror.xyz all morning, and there are still a few answers I am finding hard to get.\\n\\n1. Can I have the things I publish here published on another app? Or could I create another app if I wanted to? Say if I did not like the direction mirror was taking?\\n2. Where can I go and see my writing on the blockchain? Is it on the [ethereum](https://etherscan.io/) blockchain? Is it through [arweave](https://arweave.org)? It seems like some articles, [like this one](https://j.mirror.xyz/RUeJfZEZxr-hkuzUCakQyUuf2kOJVMPPiAWBaQFhhqc), I can see on the arweave blockchain. But others, [like this one](https://yakcollective.mirror.xyz/), don’t seem to have this. I wonder if I will find out after posting my first article\\n3. Does it cost me anything to publish? And if not, who is paying the gas fees for publishing my things to a blockchain?\\n4. Can I edit after publishing? My guess is that, if things are to be immutable and able to be sold as an NFT, then I should not be able to change what I write.\\n\\nThat might be it for the time being. I’ll add more to this post if I can edit, or to other posts if I can’t, including the answers to these questions as I find them.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nNote: This is what I see if I designate my piece as an NFT, just before publishing. It seems that this piece cannot be edited, and that there is no cost to publishing. The business model for mirror.xyz seems to be that they make money on the resale of an NFT.\\n\\n![mirror.xyz modal text displayed before publishing a piece as an NFT](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S7vT6C_SC_fRO8QA_QZp-.png?height=266&width=1210)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640745226,\"title\":\"All the basic mirror.xyz questions...\"},\"digest\":\"9aeCCFixW3wso9fA737h-RUvzH2eGoXuG5Q0sVVZRjA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x49B3b1155FabDAA360DF049060FC54932CebD7B1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W0ToTnca__Pf-iD4-LyNUjBdtnz_N6-_mOzGTU7sMQI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WcBmNky9g_HklrpICeDrSHAefBQr6Ru9YKNoQafYgy0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"x7Ufa-DqpQ0jw0v0AlEQgUGHQmusfgkUQwkCIEQWx9pQBtYGgXvjolD9sTjfK5gQO7URIwoTR6hMZEoJnnsNTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe6438d81c476a206f82435379a7e50934caa17f8ea17462547c9b4ecddf59edc665ad8392993586b349aa1304ead5880fc9da5301633b4bae6a7f0646e689ce41b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"W0ToTnca__Pf-iD4-LyNUjBdtnz_N6-_mOzGTU7sMQI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"WcBmNky9g_HklrpICeDrSHAefBQr6Ru9YKNoQafYgy0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4bKLuzGBcUyCqy8Eisd4Mti8GZQvedquY8nSfPsUBPk\"}"
