KB4 is an 8 week experience: an intro to KERNEL, co-created with 200 peers. It is a journey deep into the ♡ of web3. \\n\\n \\n When I first stumbled upon Kernel through this article, it immediately pulled me in. These were not mere words, but a feeling communicated with intention of touching deep with in the minds and hearts of readers.\\n\\n<https://kernel.community/en/learn/>\\n\\n![The Eighfold Noble Path](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lNX3nSSVIKNQW17TQU5xo.png?height=1120&width=1622)\\n\\nNot only was it deeply philosophical, it was equally approachable. Deeply personal, yet highly impactful on the environment. Web3 a word which was alienated by technological elitism, felt homely and welcoming to the artist and the coder alike.\\n\\nLike every story you begin with ‘Once upon a time’. To know where web3 comes from and what intentional direction was set. The intentions of people and how more people hijack them and how even more people come to re-instill them. And the same journeys we take in our innerworlds.\\n\\nIt’s important to do a Vibe Check!  \\n  \\n It’s a game of building trust. And creating a space, for a centered being to arise. \\n  \\n And then in this space, you meet people, from all over the world and worlds. Entrepreuners, Artists, Investors, Builders, Coders, Storytellers, Wanderers, Mystics. One of kind, of every kind. \\n\\nAnd then we drop all the charade’s of the personality, to be present and share a moment. And in that moment magic happens, intentions manifest through pure connection. A connection beyond time and space. \\n\\nIt’s a connection with yourself in the other. \\n\\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=686](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=686)\\n\\nCome experience that! \\n  \\n This is an invitation for those excited by this offering from [@KERNEL0x](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) to join the upcoming block KB5, which kicks off on the 28th of January, 2022.  \\n  \\n You may claim this NFT as a referral from your future friend! \\n  \\n You still have to apply [here](http://kernel.community/en/).
