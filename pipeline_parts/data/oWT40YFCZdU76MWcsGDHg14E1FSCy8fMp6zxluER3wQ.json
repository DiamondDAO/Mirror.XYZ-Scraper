The\\n\\npoultry-game, also the dairy-maid, assisted in the work of the\\n\\nhousehold; and the steward had hired a discharged soldier to groom the\\n\\nhorses and do the heavy labor.\\n\\nAt Nerville, Chaumont, Maffliers, Nointel, and other places of the\\n\\nneighborhood, the handsome wife of the steward was received by persons\\n\\nwho either did not know, or pretended not to know her previous\\n\\ncondition. Moreau did services to many persons. He induced his master\\n\\nto agree to certain things which seem trifles in Paris, but are really\\n\\nof immense importance in the country. After bringing about the\\n\\nappointment of a certain \\\"juge de paix\\\" at Beaumont and also at Isle-\\n\\nAdam, he had, in the same year, prevented the dismissal of a keeper-\\n\\ngeneral of the Forests, and obtained the cross of the Legion of honor\\n\\nfor the first cavalry-sergeant at Beaumont. Consequently, no festivity\\n\\nwas ever given among the bourgeoisie to which Monsieur and Madame\\n\\nMoreau were not invited. The rector of Presles and the mayor of\\n\\nPresles came every evening to play cards with them. It is difficult\\n\\nfor a man not to be kind and hospitable after feathering his nest so\\n\\ncomfortably.\\n\\nA pretty woman, and an affected one, as all retired waiting-maids of\\n\\ngreat ladies are, for after they are married they imitate their\\n\\nmistresses, Madame Moreau imported from Paris all the new fashions.\\n\\nShe wore expensive boots, and never was seen on foot, except,\\n\\noccasionally, in the finest weather. Though her husband allowed but\\n\\nfive hundred francs a year for her toilet, that sum is immense in the\\n\\nprovinces, especially if well laid out. So that Madame Moreau, fair,\\n\\nrosy, and fresh, about thirty-six years of age, still slender and\\n\\ndelicate in shape in spite of her three children, played the young\\n\\ngirl and gave herself the airs of a princess. If, when she drove by in\\n\\nher caleche, some stranger had asked, \\\"Who is she?\\\" Madame Moreau\\n\\nwould have been furious had she heard the reply: \\\"The wife of the\\n\\nsteward at Presles.\\\" She wished to be taken for the mistress of the\\n\\nchateau. In the villages, she patronized the people in the tone of a\\n\\ngreat lady. The influence of her husband over the count, proved in so\\n\\nmany years, prevented the small bourgeoisie from laughing at Madame\\n\\nMoreau, who, in the eyes of the peasants, was really a personage.\\n\\nEstelle (her name was Estelle) took no more part in the affairs of the\\n\\nstewardship then the wife of a broker does in her husband's affairs at\\n\\nthe Bourse. She even depended on Moreau for the care of the household\\n\\nand their own fortune. Confident of his MEANS, she was a thousand\\n\\nleagues from dreaming that this comfortable existence, which had\\n\\nlasted for seventeen years, could ever be endangered. And yet, when\\n\\nshe heard of the count's determination to restore the magnificent\\n\\nchateau, she felt that her enjoyments were threatened, and she urged\\n\\nher husband to come to the arrangement with Leger about Les\\n\\nMoulineaux, so that they might retire from Presles and live at Isle-\\n\\nAdam. She had no intention of returning to a position that was more or\\n\\nless that of a servant in presence of her former mistress, who,\\n\\nindeed, would have laughed to see her established in the lodge with\\n\\nall the airs and graces of a woman of the world.\\n\\nThe rancorous enmity which existed between the Reyberts and the\\n\\nMoreaus came from a wound inflicted by Madame de Reybert upon Madame\\n\\nMoreau on the first occasion when the latter assumed precedence over\\n\\nthe former on her first arrival at Presles, the wife of the steward\\n\\nbeing determined not to allow her supremacy to be undermined by a\\n\\nwoman nee de Corroy. Madame de Reybert thereupon reminded, or,\\n\\nperhaps, informed the whole country-side of Madame Moreau's former\\n\\nstation. The words \\\"waiting-maid\\\" flew from lip to lip. The envious\\n\\nacquaintances of the Moreaus throughout the neighborhood from Beaumont\\n\\nto Moisselles, began to carp and criticize with such eagerness that a\\n\\nfew sparks of the conflagration fell into the Moreau household. For\\n\\nfour years the Reyberts, cut dead by the handsome Estelle, found\\n\\nthemselves the objects of so much animadversion on the part of the\\n\\nadherents of the Moreaus that their position at Presles would not have\\n\\nbeen endurable without the thought of vengeance which had, so far,\\n\\nsupported them.\\n\\nThe Moreaus, who were very friendly with Grindot the architect, had\\n\\nreceived notice from him of the early arrival of the two painters sent\\n\\ndown to finish the decorations of the chateau, the principal paintings\\n\\nfor which were just completed by Schinner. The great painter had\\n\\nrecommended for this work the artist who was accompanied by Mistigris.\",\"timestamp\":1637316376,\"title\":\"\\nMadame Moreau had taken into her service a daughter of one of the\"},\"digest\":\"UnYesyUZjhEM4Vouv-3j3w5McWE1gQZSTr5yXZt3KCw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9GqUGIGA2-lVGI5wlwLk_s3pKa83_PiAzQ0cxgkNCxU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xmqgr-UdJPg-pgCaI_RwuELL6ScyKDuYli1rwaj8FSM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"M0qb4UC44YzFiEz3bI885qmeOIRxVUeEO2YiqvYGTb_ADipxXTn1jlTlflxtAyD3ts6Jtut8HkLt0gwaAFwnDQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x872f362c37bdb6fb1556a30c2118fd5b1d90891d3568e3c9ff650f7931679a4661798b29488e7a8808ec05287b57337739b50dfd32a29966a034658ada69d4631b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9GqUGIGA2-lVGI5wlwLk_s3pKa83_PiAzQ0cxgkNCxU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xmqgr-UdJPg-pgCaI_RwuELL6ScyKDuYli1rwaj8FSM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UnYesyUZjhEM4Vouv-3j3w5McWE1gQZSTr5yXZt3KCw\"}"
