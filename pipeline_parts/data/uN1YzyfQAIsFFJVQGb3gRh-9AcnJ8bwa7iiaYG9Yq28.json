"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There's a mighty difference between here and there.  Unless you mean to turn us into a town family while she stays--high quality, eh?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go along to your cattle! there's not much quality, high or low, where you are.\\\"\\n\\nBetty was indignant; but the annoyance exhausted itself healthfully while she was clearing away the dishes and restoring the room to its order, so that when Leonard drove up to the gate with the lumbering, old-fashioned carriage two hours afterwards, she came forth calm, cheerful, fresh as a pink in her pink muslin, and entirely the good, sensible country-girl she was.\\n\\nTwo or three years before, she and Miss Alice Bartram, daughter of the distinguished lawyer in the city, had been room-mates at the Nereid Seminary for Young Ladies.  Each liked the other for the contrast to her own self; both were honest, good and lovable, but Betty had the stronger nerves and a practical sense which seemed to be admirable courage in the eyes of Miss Alice, whose instincts were more delicate, whose tastes were fine and high, and who could not conceive of life without certain luxurious accessories.  A very cordial friendship sprang up between them,-- not the effusive girl-love, with its iterative kisses, tears, and flow of loosened hair, but springing from the respect inspired by sound and positive qualities.\\n\\nThe winter before, Betty had been invited to visit her friend in the city, and had passed a very excited and delightful week in the stately Bartram mansion.  If she were at first a little fluttered by the manners of the new world, she was intelligent enough to carry her own nature frankly through it, instead of endeavoring to assume its character.  Thus her little awkwardnesses became originalities, and she was almost popular in the lofty circle when she withdrew from it.  It was therefore, perhaps, slightly inconsistent in Betty, that she was not quite sure how Miss Bartram would accept the reverse side of this social experience.  She imagined it easier to look down and make allowances, as a host, than as a guest; she could not understand that the charm of the change might be fully equal.\\n\\nIt was lovely weather, as they drove up the sweet, ever-changing curves of the Brandywine valley.  The woods fairly laughed in the clear sunlight, and the soft, incessant, shifting breezes.  Leonard, in his best clothes, and with a smoother gloss on his brown hair, sang to himself as he urged the strong-boned horses into a trot along the levels; and Betty finally felt so quietly happy that she forgot to be nervous.  When they reached the station they walked up and down the long platform together, until the train from the city thundered up, and painfully restrained its speed.  Then Betty, catching sight of a fawn-colored travelling dress issuing from the ladies' car, caught hold of Leonard's arm, and cried:  \\\"There she is!\\\"\\n\\nMiss Bartram heard the words, and looked down with a bright, glad expression on her face.  It was not her beauty that made Leonard's heart suddenly stop beating; for she was not considered a beauty, in society.  It was something rarer than perfect beauty, yet even more difficult to describe,--a serene, unconscious grace, a pure, lofty maturity of womanhood, such as our souls bow down to in the Santa Barbara of Palma Vecchio.  Her features were not \\\"faultlessly regular,\\\" but they were informed with the finer harmonies of her character.  She was a woman, at whose feet a noble man might kneel, lay his forehead on her knee, confess his sins, and be pardoned.\\n\\nShe stepped down to the platform, and Betty's arms were about her.  After a double embrace she gently disengaged herself, turned to Leonard, gave him her hand, and said, with a smile which was delightfully frank and cordial:  \\\"I will not wait for Betty's introduction, Mr. Rambo.  She has talked to me so much of her brother Harry, that I quite know you already.\\\"\\n\\nLeonard could neither withdraw his eyes nor his hand.  It was like a double burst of warmth and sunshine, in which his breast seemed to expand, his stature to grow, and his whole nature to throb with some new and wonderful force.  A faint color came into Miss Bartram's cheeks, as they stood thus, for a moment, face to face.  She seemed to be waiting for him to speak, but of this he never thought; had any words come to his mind, his tongue could not have uttered them.\\n\\n\\\"It is not Harry,\\\" Betty explained, striving to hide her embarrassment.  \\\"This is Leonard Clare, who lives with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I do not know you so well as I thought,\\\" Miss Bartram said to him; \\\"it is the beginning of a new acquaintance, after all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There isn't no harm done,\\\" Leonard answered, and instantly feeling the awkwardness of the words, blushed so painfully that Miss Bartram felt the inadequacy of her social tact to relieve so manifest a case of distress.  But she did, instinctively, what was really best: she gave Leonard the check for her trunk, divided her satchels with Betty, and walked to the carriage.\\n\\nHe did not sing, as he drove homewards down the valley.  Seated on the trunk, in front, he quietly governed the horses, while the two girls, on the seat behind him, talked constantly and gaily.  Only the rich, steady tones of Miss Bartram's voice WOULD make their way into his ears, and every light, careless sentence printed itself upon his memory.  They came to him as if from some inaccessible planet.  Poor fellow! he was not the first to feel \\\"the desire of the moth for the star.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they reached the Rambo farm-house, it was necessary that he should give his hand to help her down from the clumsy carriage.  He held it but a moment; yet in that moment a gentle pulse throbbed upon his hard palm, and he mechanically set his teeth, to keep down the impulse which made him wild to hold it there forever.  \\\"Thank you, Mr. Clare!\\\" said Miss Bartram, and passed into the house.  When he followed presently, shouldering her trunk into the upper best-room, and kneeling upon the floor to unbuckle the straps, she found herself wondering:  \\\"Is this a knightly service, or the menial duty of a porter?  Can a man be both sensitive and ignorant, chivalrous and vulgar?\\\"\\n\\nThe question was not so easily decided, though no one guessed how much Miss Bartram pondered it, during the succeeding days.  She insisted, from the first, that her coming should make no change in the habits of the household; she rose in the cool, dewy summer dawns, dined at noon in the old brown room beside the kitchen, and only differed from the Rambos in sitting at her moonlit window, and breathing the subtle odors of a myriad leaves, long after Betty was sleeping the sleep of health.\\n\\nIt was strange how frequently the strong, not very graceful figure of Leonard Clare marched through these reveries.  She occasionally spoke to him at the common table, or as she passed the borders of the hay-field, where he and Henry were at work: but his words to her were always few and constrained.  What was there in his eyes that haunted her?  Not merely a most reverent admiration of her pure womanly refinement, although she read that also; not a fear of disparagement, such as his awkward speech implied, but something which seemed to seek agonizingly for another language than that of the lips,--something which appealed to her from equal ground, and asked for an answer.\\n\\nOne evening she met him in the lane, as she returned from the meadow.  She carried a bunch of flowers, with delicate blue and lilac bells, and asked him the name.\\n\\n\\\"Them's Brandywine cowslips,\\\" he answered; \\\"I never heard no other name.\\n\\n\\\"May I correct you?\\\" she said, gently, and with a smile which she meant to be playful.  \\\"I suppose the main thing is to speak one's thought, but there are neat and orderly ways, and there are careless ways.\\\"  Thereupon she pointed out the inaccuracies of his answer, he standing beside her, silent and attentive.  When she ceased, he did not immediately reply.\\n\\n\\\"You will take it in good part, will you not?\\\" she continued.  \\\"I hope I have not offended you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" he exclaimed, firmly, lifting his head, and looking at her.  The inscrutable expression in his dark gray eyes was stronger than before, and all his features were more clearly drawn.  He reminded her of a picture of Adam which she had once seen: there was the same rather low forehead, straight, even brows, full yet strong mouth, and that broader form of chin which repeats and balances the character of the forehead.  He was not positively handsome, but from head to foot he expressed a fresh, sound quality of manhood.\\n\\nAnother question flashed across Miss Bartram's mind:  Is life long enough to transform this clay into marble?  Here is a man in form, and with all the dignity of the perfect masculine nature: shall the broad, free intelligence, the grace and sweetness, the taste and refinement, which the best culture gives, never be his also?   If not, woman must be content with faulty representations of her ideal.\\n\\nSo musing, she walked on to the farm-house.  Leonard had picked up one of the blossoms she had let fall, and appeared to be curiously examining it.  If he had apologized for his want of grammar, or promised to reform it, her interest in him might have diminished; but his silence, his simple, natural obedience to some powerful inner force, whatever it was, helped to strengthen that phantom of him in her mind, which was now beginning to be a serious trouble.\\n\\nOnce again, the day before she left the Rambo farmhouse to return to the city, she came upon him, alone.  She had wandered off to the Brandywine, to gather ferns at a rocky point where some choice varieties were to be found.  There were a few charming clumps, half-way up a slaty cliff, which it did not seem possible to scale, and she was standing at the base, looking up in vain longing, when a voice, almost at her ear, said:\\n\\n\\\"Which ones do you want?\\\"\\n\\nAfterwards, she wondered that she did not start at the voice.  Leonard had come up the road from one of the lower fields: he wore neither coat nor waistcoat, and his shirt, open at the throat, showed the firm, beautiful white of the flesh below the strong tan of his neck.  Miss Bartram noticed the sinewy strength and elasticity of his form, yet when she looked again at the ferns, she shook her head, and answered:\\n\\n\\\"None, since I cannot have them.\\\"\\n\\nWithout saying a word, he took off his shoes, and commenced climbing the nearly perpendicular face of the cliff.  He had done it before, many a time; but Miss Bartram, although she was familiar with such exploits from the pages of many novels, had never seen the reality, and it quite took away her breath.\\n\\nWhen he descended with the ferns in his hand, she said:  \\\"It was a great risk; I wish I had not wanted them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was no risk for me,\\\" he answered.\\n\\n\\\"What can I send you in return?\\\" she asked, as they walked forwards.  \\\"I am going home to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Betty told me,\\\" Leonard said; \\\"please, wait one minute.\\\"\\n\\nHe stepped down to the bank of the stream, washed his hands carefully in the clear water, and came back to her, holding them, dripping, at his sides.\\n\\n\\\"I am very ignorant,\\\" he then continued,--\\\"ignorant and rough.  You are good, to want to send me something, but I want nothing.  Miss Bartram, you are very good.\\\"\\n\\nHe paused; but with all her tact and social experience, she did not know what to say.\\n\\n\\\"Would you do one little thing for me--not for the ferns, that was nothing--no more than you do, without thinking, for all your friends?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, surely!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Might I--might I--now,--there'll be no chance tomorrow,--shake hands with you?\\\"\\n\\nThe words seemed to be forced from him by the strength of a fierce will.  Both stopped, involuntarily.\\n\\n\\\"It's quite dry, you see,\\\" said he, offering his hand.  Her own sank upon it, palm to palm, and the fingers softly closed over each, as if with the passion and sweetness of a kiss.  Miss Bartram's heart came to her eyes, and read, at last, the question in Leonard's.  It was:  \\\"I as man, and you, as woman, are equals; will you give me time to reach you?\\\"  What her eyes replied she knew not.  A mighty influence drew her on, and a mighty doubt and dread restrained her.  One said:  \\\"Here is your lover, your husband, your cherished partner, left by fate below your station, yet whom you may lift to your side!  Shall man, alone, crown the humble maiden,--stoop to love, and, loving, ennoble?  Be you the queen, and love him by the royal right of womanhood!\\\"  But the other sternly whispered:  \\\"How shall your fine and delicate fibres be knit into this coarse texture?  Ignorance, which years cannot wash away,--low instincts, what do YOU know?--all the servile side of life, which is turned from you,--what madness to choose this, because some current of earthly magnetism sets along your nerves?  He loves you: what of that?  You are a higher being to him, and he stupidly adores you.  Think,--yes, DARE to think of all the prosaic realities of life, shared with him!\\\"\\n\\nMiss Bartram felt herself growing dizzy.  Behind the impulse which bade her cast herself upon his breast swept such a hot wave of shame and pain that her face burned, and she dropped her eyelids to shut out the sight of his face.  But, for one endless second, the sweeter voice spoke through their clasped hands.  Perhaps he kissed hers; she did not know; she only heard herself murmur:\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye!  Pray go on; I will rest here.\\\"\\n\\nShe sat down upon a bank by the roadside, turned away her head, and closed her eyes.  It was long before the tumult in her nature subsided.  If she reflected, with a sense of relief, \\\"nothing was said,\\\" the thought immediately followed, \\\"but all is known.\\\"  It was impossible,--yes, clearly impossible; and then came such a wild longing, such an assertion of the right and truth and justice of love, as made her seem a miserable coward, the veriest slave of conventionalities.\\n\\nOut of this struggle dawned self-knowledge, and the strength which is born of it.  When she returned to the house, she was pale and weary, but capable of responding to Betty Rambo's constant cheerfulness.  The next day she left for the city, without having seen Leonard Clare again.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nHenry Rambo married, and brought a new mistress to the farm-house.  Betty married, and migrated to a new home in another part of the State.  Leonard Clare went back to his trade, and returned no more in harvest-time.  So the pleasant farm by the Brandywine, having served its purpose as a background, will be seen no more in this history.\\n\\nMiss Bartram's inmost life, as a woman, was no longer the same.  The point of view from which she had beheld the world was shifted, and she was obliged to remodel all her feelings and ideas to conform to it.  But the process was gradual, and no one stood near enough to her to remark it.  She was occasionally suspected of that \\\"eccentricity\\\" which, in a woman of five-and-twenty, is looked upon as the first symptom of a tendency to old-maidenhood, but which is really the sign of an earnest heart struggling with the questions of life.  In the society of cities, most men give only the shallow, flashy surface of their natures to the young women they meet, and Miss Bartram, after that revelation of the dumb strength of an ignorant man, sometimes grew very impatient of the platitudes and affectations which came to her clad in elegant words, and accompanied by irreproachable manners.\\n\\nShe had various suitors; for that sense of grace and repose and sweet feminine power, which hung around her like an atmosphere, attracted good and true men towards her.  To some, indeed, she gave that noble, untroubled friendship which is always possible between the best of the two sexes, and when she was compelled to deny the more intimate appeal, it was done with such frank sorrow, such delicate tenderness, that she never lost the friend in losing the lover.  But, as one year after another went by, and the younger members of her family fell off into their separate domestic orbits, she began to shrink a little at the perspective of a lonely life, growing lonelier as it receded from the Present.\\n\\nBy this time, Leonard Clare had become almost a dream to her.  She had neither seen him nor heard of him since he let go her hand on that memorable evening beside the stream.  He was a strange, bewildering chance, a cypher concealing a secret which she could not intelligently read.  Why should she keep the memory of that power which was, perhaps, some unconscious quality of his nature (no, it was not so! something deeper than reason cried:), or long since forgotten, if felt, by him?\\n\\nThe man whom she most esteemed came back to her.  She knew the ripeness and harmony of his intellect, the nobility of his character, and the generosity of a feeling which would be satisfied with only a partial return.  She felt sure, also, that she should never possess a sentiment nearer to love than that which pleaded his cause in her heart.  But her hand lay quiet in his, her pulses were calm when he spoke, and his face, manly and true as it was, never invaded her dreams.  All questioning was vain; her heart gave no solution of the riddle.  Perhaps her own want was common to all lives: then she was cherishing a selfish ideal, and rejecting the positive good offered to her hands.\\n\\nAfter long hesitation she yielded.  The predictions of society came to naught; instead of becoming an \\\"eccentric\\\" spinster, Miss Bartram was announced to be the affianced bride of Mr. Lawrie.  A few weeks and months rolled around, and when the wedding-day came, she almost hailed it as the port of refuge, where she should find a placid and peaceful life.\\n\\nThey were married by an aged clergyman, a relative of the bridegroom.  The cross-street where his chapel stood, fronting a Methodist church--both of the simplest form of that architecture fondly supposed to be Gothic,--was quite blocked up by the carriages of the party.  The pews were crowded with elegant guests, the altar was decorated with flowers, and the ceremony lacked nothing of its usual solemn beauty.  The bride was pale, but strikingly calm and self-possessed, and when she moved towards the door as Mrs. Lawrie, on her husband's arm, many matrons, recalling their own experience, marvelled at her unflurried dignity.\\n\\nJust as they passed out the door, and the bridal carriage was summoned, a singular thing happened.  Another bridal carriage drew up from the opposite side, and a newly wedded pair came forth from the portal of the Methodist church.  Both parties stopped, face to face, divided only by the narrow street.  Mrs. Lawrie first noticed the flushed cheeks of the other bride, her white dress, rather showy than elegant, and the heavy gold ornaments she wore.  Then she turned to the bridegroom.  He was tall and well-formed, dressed like a gentleman, but like one who is not yet unconscious of his dress, and had the air of a man accustomed to exercise some authority.\\n\\nShe saw his face, and instantly all other faces disappeared.  From the opposite brink of a tremendous gulf she looked into his eyes, and their blended ray of love and despair pierced her to the heart.\\n\\nThere was a roaring in her ears, followed a long sighing sound, like that of the wind on some homeless waste; she leaned more heavily on her husband's arm, leaned against his shoulder, slid slowly down into his supporting clasp, and knew no more.\\n\\n\\\"She's paying for her mock composure, after all,\\\" said the matrons.\\n\\n\\\"It must have been a great effort.\\\"\\n\\nIII.\\n\\nTen years afterwards, Mrs. Lawrie went on board a steamer at Southampton, bound for New York.  She was travelling alone, having been called suddenly from Europe by the approaching death of her aged father.  For two or three days after sailing, the thick, rainy spring weather kept all below, except a few hardy gentlemen who crowded together on the lee of the smoke-stack, and kept up a stubborn cheerfulness on a very small capital of comfort.  There were few cabin-passengers on board, but the usual crowd of emigrants in the steerage.\\n\\nMrs. Lawrie's face had grown calmer and colder during these years.  There was yet no gray in her hair, no wrinkles about her clear eyes; each feature appeared to be the same, but the pale, monotonous color which had replaced the warm bloom of her youth, gave them a different character.  The gracious dignity of her manner, the mellow tones of her voice, still expressed her unchanging goodness, yet those who met her were sure to feel, in some inexplicable way, that to be good is not always to be happy.  Perhaps, indeed, her manner was older than her face and form: she still attracted the interest of men, but with a certain doubt and reserve.\\n\\nCertain it is that when she made her appearance on deck, glad of the blue sky and sunshine, and threw back her hood to feel the freshness of the sea air, all eyes followed her movements, except those of a forlorn individual, who, muffled in his cloak and apparently sea-sick, lay upon one of the benches.  The captain presently joined her, and the gentlemen saw that she was bright and perfectly self-possessed in conversation: some of them immediately resolved to achieve an acquaintance.  The dull, passive existence of the beginning of every voyage, seemed to be now at an end.  It was time for the little society of the vessel to awake, stir itself, and organize a life of its own, for the few remaining days.\\n\\nThat night, as Mrs. Lawrie was sleeping in her berth, she suddenly awoke with a singular feeling of dread and suspense.  She listened silently, but for some time distinguished none other than the small sounds of night on shipboard--the indistinct orders, the dragging of ropes, the creaking of timbers, the dull, regular jar of the engine, and the shuffling noise of feet overhead.  But, ere long, she seemed to catch faint, distant sounds, that seemed like cries; then came hurry and confusion on deck; then voices in the cabin, one of which said: \\\"they never can get it under, at this rate!\\\"\\n\\nShe rose, dressed herself hastily, and made her way through pale and excited stewards, and the bewildered passengers who were beginning to rush from their staterooms, to the deck.  In the wild tumult which prevailed, she might have been thrown down and trampled under foot, had not a strong arm seized her around the waist, and borne her towards the stern, where there were but few persons.\\n\\n\\\"Wait here!\\\" said a voice, and her protector plunged into the crowd.\\n\\nShe saw, instantly, the terrible fate which had fallen upon the vessel.  The bow was shrouded in whirls of smoke, through which dull red flashes began to show themselves; and all the length and breadth of the deck was filled with a screaming, struggling, fighting mass of desperate human beings.  She saw the captain, officers, and a few of the crew working in vain against the disorder: she saw the boats filled before they were lowered, and heard the shrieks as they were capsized; she saw spars and planks and benches cast overboard, and maddened men plunging after them; and then, like the sudden opening of the mouth of Hell, the relentless, triumphant fire burst through the forward deck and shot up to the foreyard.\\n\\nShe was leaning against the mizen shrouds, between the coils of rope.  Nobody appeared to notice her, although the quarter-deck was fast filling with persons driven back by the fire, yet still shrinking from the terror and uncertainty of the sea.  She thought:  \\\"It is but death--why should I fear?  The waves are at hand, to save me from all suffering.\\\"  And the collective horror of hundreds of beings did not so overwhelm her as she had both fancied and feared; the tragedy of each individual life was lost in the confusion, and was she not a sharer in their doom?\\n\\nSuddenly, a man stood before her with a cork life-preserver in his hands, and buckled it around her securely, under the arms.  He was panting and almost exhausted, yet he strove to make his voice firm, and even cheerful, as he said:\\n\\n\\\"We fought the cowardly devils as long as there was any hope.  Two boats are off, and two capsized; in ten minutes more every soul must take to the water.  Trust to me, and I will save you or die with you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What else can I do?\\\" she answered.\\n\\nWith a few powerful strokes of an axe, he broke off the top of the pilot-house, bound two or three planks to it with ropes, and dragged the mass to the bulwarks.\\n\\n\\\"The minute this goes,\\\" he then said to her, \\\"you go after it, and I follow.  Keep still when you rise to the surface.\\\"\\n\\nShe left the shrouds, took hold of the planks at his side, and they heaved the rude raft into the sea.  In an instant she was seized and whirled over the side; she instinctively held her breath, felt a shock, felt herself swallowed up in an awful, fathomless coldness, and then found herself floating below the huge towering hull which slowly drifted away.\\n\\nIn another moment there was one at her side.  \\\"Lay your hand on my shoulder,\\\" he said; and when she did so, swam for the raft, which they soon reached.  While she supported herself by one of the planks he so arranged and bound together the pieces of timber that in a short time they could climb upon them and rest, not much washed by the waves.  The ship drifted further and further, casting a faint, though awful, glare over the sea, until the light was suddenly extinguished, as the hull sank.\\n\\nThe dawn was in the sky by this time, and as it broadened they could see faint specks here and there, where others, like themselves, clung to drifting spars.  Mrs. Lawrie shuddered with cold and the reaction from an excitement which had been far more powerful than she knew at the time.\\n\\nHer preserver then took off his coat, wrapped it around her, and produced a pocket-flask, saying; \\\"this will support us the longest; it is all I could find, or bring with me.\\\"\\n\\nShe sat, leaning against his shoulder, though partly turned away from him: all she could say was: \\\"you are very good.\\\"\\n\\nAfter awhile he spoke, and his voice seemed changed to her ears.  \\\"You must be thinking of Mr. Lawrie.  It will, indeed, be terrible for him to hear of the disaster, before knowing that you are saved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"God has spared him that distress,\\\" she answered.  \\\"Mr. Lawrie died, a year ago.\\\"\\n\\nShe felt a start in the strong frame upon which she leaned.  After a few minutes of silence, he slowly shifted his position towards her, yet still without facing her, and said, almost in a whisper:\\n\\n\\\"You have said that I am very good.  Will you put your hand in mine?\\\"\\n\\nShe stretched hers eagerly and gratefully towards him.  What had happened?  Through all the numbness of her blood, there sprang a strange new warmth from his strong palm, and a pulse, which she had almost forgotten as a dream of the past, began to beat through her frame.  She turned around all a-tremble, and saw his face in the glow of the coming day.\\n\\n\\\"Leonard Clare!\\\" she cried.\\n\\n\\\"Then you have not forgotten me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Could one forget, when the other remembers?\\\"\\n\\nThe words came involuntarily from her lips.  She felt what they implied, the moment afterwards, and said no more.  But he kept her hand in his.\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Lawrie,\\\" he began, after another silence, \\\"we are hanging by a hair on the edge of life, but I shall gladly let that hair break, since I may tell you now, purely and in the hearing of God, how I have tried to rise to you out of the low place in which you found me.  At first you seemed too far; but you yourself led me the first step of the way, and I have steadily kept my eyes on you, and followed it.  When I had learned my trade, I came to the city.  No labor was too hard for me, no study too difficult.  I was becoming a new man, I saw all that was still lacking, and how to reach it, and I watched you, unknown, at a distance.  Then I heard of your engagement: you were lost, and something of which I had begun to dream, became insanity.  I determined to trample it out of my life.  The daughter of the master-builder, whose first assistant I was, had always favored me in her society; and I soon persuaded her to love me.  I fancied, too, that I loved her as most married men seemed to love their wives; the union would advance me to a partnership in her father's business, and my fortune would then be secured.  You know what happened; but you do not know how the sight of your face planted the old madness again in my life, and made me a miserable husband, a miserable man of wealth, almost a scoffer at the knowledge I had acquired for your sake.\\n\\n\\\"When my wife died, taking an only child with her, there was nothing left to me except the mechanical ambition to make myself, without you, what I imagined I might have become, through you.  I have studied and travelled, lived alone and in society, until your world seemed to be almost mine: but you were not there!\\\"\\n\\nThe sun had risen, while they sat, rocking on their frail support.  Her hand still lay in his, and her head rested on his shoulder.  Every word he spoke sank into her heart with a solemn sweetness, in which her whole nature was silent and satisfied.  Why should she speak?  He knew all.\\n\\nYes, it seemed that he knew.  His arm stole around her, and her head was drawn from his shoulder to the warm breadth of his breast.\\n\\nSomething hard pressed her cheek, and she lifted her hand to move it aside.  He drew forth a flat medallion case; and to the unconscious question in her face, such a sad, tender smile came to his lips, that she could not repress a sudden pain.  Was it the miniature of his dead wife?\\n\\nHe opened the case, and showed her, under the glass, a faded, pressed flower.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"The Brandywine cowslip you dropped, when you spoke to me in the lane.  Then it was that you showed me the first step of the way.\\\"\\n\\nShe laid her head again upon his bosom.  Hour after hour they sat, and the light swells of the sea heaved them aimlessly to and fro, and the sun burned them, and the spray drenched their limbs.  At last Leonard Clare roused himself and looked around: he felt numb and faint, and he saw, also, that her strength was rapidly failing.\\n\\n\\\"We cannot live much longer, I fear,\\\" he said, clasping her closely in his arms.  \\\"Kiss me once, darling, and then we will die.\\\"\\n\\nShe clung to him and kissed him.\\n\\n\\\"There is life, not death, in your lips!\\\" he cried.  \\\"Oh, God, if we should live!\\\"\\n\\nHe rose painfully to his feet, stood, tottering? on the raft, and looked across the waves.  Presently he began to tremble, then to sob like a child, and at last spoke, through his tears:\\n\\n\\\"A sail! a sail!--and heading towards us!\\\"\\n\\nMRS. STRONGITHARM'S REPORT.\\n\\nMr. Editor,--If you ever read the \\\"Burroak Banner\\\" (which you will find among your exchanges, as the editor publishes your prospectus for six weeks every year, and sends no bill to you) my name will not be that of a stranger.  Let me throw aside all affectation of humility, and say that I hope it is already and not unfavorably familiar to you.  I am informed by those who claim to know that the manuscripts of obscure writers are passed over by you editors without examination--in short, that I must first have a name, if I hope to make one.  The fact that an article of three hundred and seventy-five pages, which I sent, successively, to the \\\"North American Review,\\\" the \\\"Catholic World,\\\" and the \\\"Radical,\\\" was in each case returned to me with MY knot on the tape by which it was tied, convinces me that such is indeed the case.  A few years ago I should not have meekly submitted to treatment like this; but late experiences have taught me the vanity of many womanly dreams.\\n\\nYou are acquainted with the part I took (I am SURE you must have seen it in the \\\"Burroak Banner\\\" eight years ago) in creating that public sentiment in our favor which invested us with all the civil and political rights of men.  How the editors of the \\\"Revolution,\\\" to which I subscribe, and the conventions in favor of the equal rights of women, recently held in Boston and other cities, have failed to notice our noble struggle, is a circumstance for which I will not try to account.  I will only say--and it is a hint which SOME PERSONS will understand--that there are other forms of jealousy than those which spring from love.\\n\\nIt is, indeed, incredible that so little is known, outside the State of Atlantic, of the experiment--I mean the achievement--of the last eight years.  While the war lasted, we did not complain that our work was ignored; but now that our sisters in other States are acting as if in complete unconsciousness of what WE have done--now that we need their aid and they need ours (but in different ways), it is time that somebody should speak.  Were Selina Whiston living, I should leave the task to her pen; she never recovered from the shock and mortification of her experiences in the State Legislature, in '64--but I will not anticipate the history.  Of all the band of female iconoclasts, as the Hon. Mr. Screed called us in jest--it was no jest afterwards, HIS image being the first to go down--of all, I say, \\\"some are married, and some are dead,\\\" and there is really no one left so familiar with the circumstances as I am, and equally competent to give a report of them.\\n\\nMr. Spelter (the editor of the \\\"Burroak Banner\\\") suggests that I must be brief, if I wish my words to reach the ears of the millions for whom they are designed; and I shall do my best to be so.  If I were not obliged to begin at the very beginning, and if the interests of Atlantic had not been swallowed up, like those of other little States, in the whirlpool of national politics, I should have much less to say.  But if Mr. George Fenian Brain and Mrs. Candy Station do not choose to inform the public of either the course or the results of our struggle, am I to blame?  If I could have attended the convention in Boston, and had been allowed to speak--and I am sure the distinguished Chairwoman would have given me a chance--it would have been the best way, no doubt, to set our case before the world.\\n\\nI must first tell you how it was that we succeeded in forcing the men to accept our claims, so much in advance of other States.  We were indebted for it chiefly to the skill and adroitness of Selina Whiston.  The matter had been agitated, it is true, for some years before, and as early as 1856, a bill, drawn up by Mrs. Whiston herself, had been introduced into the Legislature, where it received three votes.  Moreover, we had held meetings in almost every election precinct in the State, and our Annual Fair (to raise funds) at Gaston, while the Legislature was in session, was always very brilliant and successful.  So the people were not entirely unprepared.\\n\\nAlthough our State had gone for Fremont in 1856, by a small majority, the Democrats afterwards elected their Governor; and both parties, therefore, had hopes of success in 1860.  The canvass began early, and was very animated.  Mrs. Whiston had already inaugurated the custom of attending political meetings, and occasionally putting a question to the stump orator--no matter of which party; of sometimes, indeed, taking the stump herself, after the others had exhausted their wind.  She was very witty, as you know, and her stories were so good and so capitally told, that neither Democrat nor Republican thought of leaving the ground while she was upon the stand.\\n\\nNow, it happened that our Congressional District was one of the closest.  It happened, also, that our candidate (I am a Republican, and so is Mr. Strongitharm) was rather favorably inclined to the woman's cause.  It happened, thirdly--and this is the seemingly insignificant pivot upon which we whirled into triumph--that he, Mr. Wrangle, and the opposing candidate, Mr. Tumbrill, had arranged to hold a joint meeting at Burroak.  This meeting took place on a magnificent day, just after the oats-harvest; and everybody, for twenty miles around, was there.  Mrs. Whiston, together with Sarah Pincher, Olympia Knapp, and several other prominent advocates of our cause, met at my house in the morning; and we all agreed that it was time to strike a blow.  The rest of us magnanimously decided to take no part in the concerted plan, though very eager to do so.  Selina Whiston declared that she must have the field to herself; and when she said that, we knew she meant it.\\n\\nIt was generally known that she was on the ground.  In fact, she spent most of the time while Messrs. Wrangle and Tumbrill were speaking, in walking about through the crowds--so after an hour apiece for the gentlemen, and then fifteen minutes apiece for a rejoinder, and the Star Spangled Banner from the band, for both sides, we were not a bit surprised to hear a few cries of \\\"Whiston!\\\" from the audience.  Immediately we saw the compact gray bonnet and brown serge dress (she knew what would go through a crowd without tearing!) splitting the wedge of people on the steps leading to the platform.  I noticed that the two Congressional candidates looked at each other and smiled, in spite of the venomous charges they had just been making.\\n\\nWell--I won't attempt to report her speech, though it was her most splendid effort (as people WILL say, when it was no effort to her at all).  But the substance of it was this: after setting forth woman's wrongs and man's tyranny, and taxation without representation, and an equal chance, and fair-play, and a struggle for life (which you know all about from the other conventions), she turned squarely around to the two candidates arid said:\\n\\n\\\"Now to the practical application.  You, Mr. Wrangle, and you, Mr. Tumbrill, want to be elected to Congress.  The district is a close one: you have both counted the votes in advance (oh, I know your secrets!) and there isn't a difference of a hundred in your estimates.  A very little will turn the scale either way.  Perhaps a woman's influence--perhaps my voice--might do it.  But I will give you an equal chance.  So much power is left to woman, despite what you withhold, that we, the women of Putnam, Shinnebaug, and Rancocus counties, are able to decide which of you shall be elected.  Either of you would give a great deal to have a majority of the intelligent women of the District on your side: it would already be equivalent to success.  Now, to show that we understand the political business from which you have excluded us-- to prove that we are capable of imitating the noble example of MEN--we offer to sell our influence, as they their votes, to the highest bidder!\\\"\\n\\nThere was great shouting and cheering among the people at this, but the two candidates, somehow or other, didn't seem much amused.\\n\\n\\\"I stand here,\\\" she continued, \\\"in the interest of my struggling sisters, and with authority to act for them.  Which of you will bid the most--not in offices or material advantages, as is the way of your parties, but in the way of help to the Woman's Cause?  Which of you will here publicly pledge himself to say a word for us, from now until election-day, whenever he appears upon the stump?\\\"\\n\\nThere was repeated cheering, and cries of \\\"Got 'em there!\\\"  (Men are so vulgar).\\n\\nI pause for a reply.  Shall they not answer me?\\\" she continued, turning to the audience.\\n\\n\\\"Then there were tremendous cries of \\\"Yes! yes! Wrangle! Tumbrill!\\\"\\n\\nMr. Wrangle looked at Mr. Tumbrill, and made a motion with his head, signifying that he should speak.  Then Mr. Tumbrill looked at Mr. Wrangle, and made a motion that HE should speak.  The people saw all this, and laughed and shouted as if they would never finish.\\n\\nMr. Wrangle, on second thoughts (this is my private surmise), saw that boldness would just then be popular; so he stepped forward.\\n\\n\\\"Do I understand,\\\" he said, \\\"that my fair and eloquent friend demands perfect political and civil equality for her sex?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do!\\\" exclaimed Selina Whiston, in her firmest manner.\\n\\n\\\"Let me be more explicit,\\\" he continued.  \\\"You mean precisely the same rights, the same duties, the same obligations, the same responsibilities?\\\"\\n\\nShe repeated the phrases over after him, affirmatively, with an emphasis which I never heard surpassed.\\n\\n\\\"Pardon me once more,\\\" said Mr. Wrangle; \\\"the right to vote, to hold office, to practise law, theology, medicine, to take part in all municipal affairs, to sit on juries, to be called upon to aid in the execution of the law, to aid in suppressing disturbances, enforcing public order, and performing military duty?\\\"\\n\\nHere there were loud cheers from the audience; and a good many voices cried out:  \\\"Got her there!\\\"  (Men are so very vulgar.)\\n\\nMrs. Whiston looked troubled for a moment, but she saw that a moment's hesitation would be fatal to our scheme, so she brought out her words as if each one were a maul-blow on the butt-end of a wedge:\\n\\n\\\"All--that--we--demand!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then,\\\" said Mr. Wrangle, \\\"I bid my support in exchange for the women's!  Just what the speaker demands, without exception or modification--equal privileges, rights, duties and obligations, without regard to the question of sex!  Is that broad enough?\\\"\\n\\nI was all in a tremble when it came to that.  Somehow Mr. Wrangle's acceptance of the bid did not inspire me, although it promised so much.  I had anticipated opposition, dissatisfaction, tumult.  So had Mrs. Whiston, and I could see, and the crowd could see, that she was not greatly elated.\\n\\nMr. Wrangle made a very significant bow to Mr. Tumbrill, and then sat down.  There were cries of \\\"Tumbrill!\\\" and that gentleman--none of us, of course, believing him sincere, for we knew his private views--came forward and made exactly the same pledge.  I will do both parties the justice to say that they faithfully kept their word; nay, it was generally thought the repetition of their brief pleas for woman, at some fifty meetings before election came, had gradually conducted them to the belief that they were expressing their own personal sentiments.  The mechanical echo in public thus developed into an opinion in private.  My own political experience has since demonstrated to me that this is a phenomenon very common among men.\\n\\nThe impulse generated at that meeting gradually spread all over the State.  We--the leaders of the Women's Movement--did not rest until we had exacted the same pledge from all the candidates of both parties; and the nearer it drew towards election-day, the more prominence was given, in the public meetings, to the illustration and discussion of the subject.  Our State went for Lincoln by a majority of 2763 (as you will find by consulting the \\\"Tribune Almanac\\\"), and Mr. Wrangle was elected to Congress, having received a hundred and forty-two more votes than his opponent.  Mr. Tumbrill has always attributed his defeat to his want of courage in not taking up at once the glove which Selina Whiston threw down.\\n\\nI think I have said enough to make it clear how the State of Atlantic came to be the first to grant equal civil and political rights to women.  When the Legislature of 1860-'61 met at Gaston, we estimated that we might count upon fifty-three out of the seventy-one Republican Senators and Assemblymen, and on thirty-four out of the sixty-five Democrats.  This would give a majority of twenty-eight in the House, and ten in the Senate.  Should the bill pass, there was still a possibility that it might be vetoed by the Governor, of whom we did not feel sure.  We therefore arranged that our Annual Fair should be held a fortnight later than usual, and that the proceeds (a circumstance known only to the managers) should be devoted to a series of choice suppers, at which we entertained, not only the Governor and our friends in both Houses, but also, like true Christians, our legislatorial enemies.  Olympia Knapp, who, you know, is so very beautiful, presided at these entertainments.  She put forth all her splendid powers, and with more effect than any of us suspected.  On the day before the bill reached its third reading, the Governor made her an offer of marriage.  She came to the managers in great agitation, and laid the matter before them, stating that she was overwhelmed with surprise (though Sarah Pincher always maintained that she wasn't in the least), and asking their advice.  We discussed the question for four hours, and finally decided that the interests of the cause would oblige her to accept the Governor's hand.  \\\"Oh, I am so glad!\\\" cried Olympia, \\\"for I accepted him at once.\\\"  It was a brave, a noble deed!\\n\\nNow, I would ask those who assert that women are incapable of conducting the business of politics, to say whether any set of men, of either party, could have played their cards more skilfully?  Even after the campaign was over we might have failed, had it not been for the suppers.  We owed this idea, like the first, to the immortal Selina Whiston.  A lucky accident--as momentous in its way as the fall of an apple to Newton, or the flying of a kite to Dr. Franklin--gave her the secret principle by which the politics of men are directed.  Her house in Whittletown was the half of a double frame building, and the rear-end of the other part was the private office of--but no, I will not mention the name--a lawyer and a politician.  He was known as a \\\"wirepuller,\\\" and the other wire-pullers of his party used to meet in his office and discuss matters.  Mrs. Whiston always asserted that there was a mouse-hole through the partition; but she had energy enough to have made a hole herself, for the sake of the cause.\\n\\nShe never would tell us all she overheard.  \\\"It is enough,\\\" she would say, \\\"that I know how the thing is done.\\\"\\n\\nI remember that we were all considerably startled when she first gave us an outline of her plan.  On my saying that I trusted the dissemination of our principles would soon bring us a great adhesion, she burst out with:\\n\\n\\\"Principles!  Why if we trust to principles, we shall never succeed!  We must rely upon INFLUENCES, as the men do; we must fight them with their own weapons, and even then we are at a disadvantage, because we cannot very well make use of whiskey and cigars.\\\"\\n\\nWe yielded, because we had grown accustomed to be guided by her; and, moreover, we had seen, time and again, how she could succeed-- as, for instance, in the Nelson divorce case (but I don't suppose you ever heard of that), when the matter seemed nigh hopeless to all of us.  The history of 1860 and the following winter proves that in her the world has lost a stateswoman.  Mr. Wrangle and Governor Battle have both said to me that they never knew a measure to be so splendidly engineered both before the public and in the State Legislature.\\n\\nAfter the bill had been passed, and signed by the Governor, and so had become a law, and the grand Women's Jubilee had been held at Gaston, the excitement subsided.  It would be nearly a year to the next State election, and none of the women seemed to care for the local and municipal elections in the spring.  Besides, there was a good deal of anxiety among them in regard to the bill, which was drawn up in almost the exact terms used by Mr. Wrangle at the political meeting.  In fact, we always have suspected that he wrote it.  The word \\\"male\\\" was simply omitted from all laws.  \\\"Nothing is changed,\\\" said Mrs. Whiston, quoting Charles X., \\\"there are only 201,758 more citizens in Atlantic!\\\"\\n\\nThis was in January, 1861, you must remember; and the shadow of the coming war began to fall over us.  Had the passage of our bill been postponed a fortnight it would have been postponed indefinitely, for other and (for the men) more powerful excitements followed one upon the other.  Even our jubilee was thinly attended, and all but two of the members on whom we relied for speeches failed us.  Governor Battle, who was to have presided, was at Washington, and Olympia, already his wife, accompanied him.  (I may add that she has never since taken any active part with us.  They have been in Europe for the last three years.)\\n\\nMost of the women--here in Burroak, at least--expressed a feeling of disappointment that there was no palpable change in their lot, no sense of extended liberty, such as they imagined would come to transform them into brighter and better creatures.  They supposed that they would at once gain in importance in the eyes of the men; but the men were now so preoccupied by the events at the South that they seemed to have forgotten our political value.  Speaking for myself, as a good Union woman, I felt that I must lay aside, for a time, the interests of my sex.  Once, it is true, I proposed to accompany Mr. Strongitharm to a party caucus at the Wrangle House; but he so suddenly discovered that he had business in another part of the town, that I withdrew my proposition.\\n\\nAs the summer passed over, and the first and second call for volunteers had been met, and more than met, by the patriotic men of the State (how we blessed them!) we began to take courage, and to feel, that if our new civil position brought us no very tangible enjoyment, at least it imposed upon us no very irksome duties.\\n\\nThe first practical effect of the new law came to light at the August term of our County Court.  The names of seven women appeared on the list of jurors, but only three of them answered to their names.  One, the wife of a poor farmer, was excused by the Judge, as there was no one to look after six small children in her absence; another was a tailoress, with a quantity of work on hand, some of which she proposed bringing with her into Court, in order to save time; but as this could not be allowed, she made so much trouble that she was also finally let off.  Only one, therefore, remained to serve; fortunately for the credit of our sex, she was both able and willing to do so; and we afterward made a subscription, and presented her with a silver fish-knife, on account of her having tired out eleven jurymen, and brought in a verdict of $5,000 damages against a young man whom she convicted of seduction.  She told me that no one would ever know what she endured during those three days; but the morals of our county have been better ever since.\\n\\nMr. Spelter told me that his State exchanges showed that there had been difficulties of the same kind in all the other counties.  In Mendip (the county-town of which is Whittletown, Mrs. Whiston's home) the immediate result had been the decision, on the part of the Commissioners, to build an addition at the rear of the Court- House, with large, commodious and well-furnished jury-rooms, so arranged that a comfortable privacy was secured to the jury-women.  I did my best to have the same improvement adopted here, but, alas! I have not the ability of Selina Whiston in such matters, and there is nothing to this day but the one vile, miserable room, properly furnished in no particular except spittoons.\\n\\nThe nominating Conventions were held in August, also, and we were therefore called upon to move at once, in order to secure our fair share.  Much valuable time had been lost in discussing a question of policy, namely, whether we should attach ourselves to the two parties already in existence, according to our individual inclinations, or whether we should form a third party for ourselves.  We finally accepted the former proposition, and I think wisely; for the most of us were so ignorant of political tricks and devices, that we still needed to learn from the men, and we could not afford to draw upon us the hostility of both parties, in the very infancy of our movement.\\n\\nNever in my life did I have such a task, as in drumming up a few women to attend the primary township meeting for the election of delegates.  It was impossible to make them comprehend its importance.  Even after I had done my best to explain the technicalities of male politics, and fancied that I had made some impression, the answer would be:  \\\"Well, I'd go, I'm sure, just to oblige you, but then there's the tomatoes to be canned\\\"--or, \\\"I'm so behindhand with my darning and patching\\\"--or, \\\"John'll be sure to go, and there's no need of two from the same house\\\"--and so on, until I was mightily discouraged.  There were just nine of us, all told, to about a hundred men.  I won't deny that our situation that night, at the Wrangle House, was awkward and not entirely agreeable.  To be sure the landlord gave us the parlor, and most of the men came in, now and then, to speak to us; but they managed the principal matters all by themselves, in the bar-room, which was such a mess of smoke and stale liquor smells, that it turned my stomach when I ventured in for two minutes.\\n\\nI don't think we should have accomplished much, but for a 'cute idea of Mrs. Wilbur, the tinman's wife.  She went to the leaders, and threatened them that the women's vote should be cast in a body for the Democratic candidates, unless we were considered in making up the ticket.  THAT helped: the delegates were properly instructed, and the County Convention afterward nominated two men and one woman as candidates for the Assembly.  That woman was--as I need hardly say, for the world knows it--myself.  I had not solicited the honor, and therefore could not refuse, especially as my daughter Melissa was then old enough to keep house in my absence.  No woman had applied for the nomination for Sheriff, but there were seventeen schoolmistresses anxious for the office of County Treasurer.  The only other nomination given to the women, however, was that of Director (or rather, Directress) of the Poor, which was conferred on Mrs. Bassett, wife of a clergyman.\\n\\nMr. Strongitharm insisted that I should, in some wise, prepare myself for my new duties, by reading various political works, and I conscientiously tried to do so--but, dear me! it was much more of a task than I supposed.  We had all read the debate on our bill, of course; but I always skipped the dry, stupid stuff about the tariff, and finance, and stay laws and exemption laws, and railroad company squabbles; and for the life of me I can't see, to this day, what connection there is between these things and Women's Rights.  But, as I said, I did my best, with the help of Webster's Dictionary; although the further I went the less I liked it.\\n\\nAs election-day drew nearer, our prospects looked brighter.  The Republican ticket, under the editorial head of the \\\"Burroak Banner,\\\" with my name and Mrs. Bassett's among the men's, was such an evidence, that many women, notably opposed to the cause, said:  \\\"We didn't want the right, but since we have it, we shall make use of it.\\\"  This was exactly what Mrs. Whiston had foretold.  We estimated that--taking the County tickets all over the State--we had about one-twentieth of the Republican, and one-fiftieth of the Democratic, nominations.  This was far from being our due, but still it was a good beginning.\\n\\nMy husband insisted that I should go very early to the polls.  I could scarcely restrain a tear of emotion as I gave my first ballot into the hands of the judges.  There were not a dozen persons present, and the act did not produce the sensation which I expected.  One man cried out:  \\\"Three cheers for our Assemblywoman!\\\" and they gave them; and I thereupon returned home in the best spirits.  I devoted the rest of the day to relieving poorer women, who could not have spared the time to vote, if I had not, meanwhile, looked after their children.  The last was Nancy Black, the shoemaker's wife in our street, who kept me waiting upon her till it was quite dark.  When she finally came, the skirt of her dress was ripped nearly off, her hair was down and her comb broken; but she was triumphant, for Sam Black was with her, and SOBER.\\\"  The first time since we were married, Mrs. Strongitharm!\\\" she cried.  Then she whispered to me, as I was leaving:  \\\"And I've killed HIS vote, anyhow!\\\"\\n\\nWhen the count was made, our party was far ahead.  Up to this time, I think, the men of both parties had believed that only a few women, here and there, would avail themselves of their new right-- but they were roundly mistaken.  Although only ten per cent. of the female voters went to the polls, yet three-fourths of them voted the Republican ticket, which increased the majority of that party, in the State, about eleven thousand.\\n\\nIt was amazing what an effect followed this result.  The whole country would have rung with it, had we not been in the midst of war.  Mr. Wrangle declared that he had always been an earnest advocate of the women's cause.  Governor Battle, in his next message, congratulated the State on the signal success of the experiment, and the Democratic masses, smarting under their defeat, cursed their leaders for not having been sharp enough to conciliate the new element.  The leaders themselves said nothing, and in a few weeks the rank and file recovered their cheerfulness.  Even Mrs. Whiston, with all her experience, was a little puzzled by this change of mood.  Alas! she was far from guessing the correct explanation.\\n\\nIt was a great comfort to me that Mrs. Whiston was also elected to the Legislature.  My husband had just then established his manufactory of patent self-scouring knife-blades (now so celebrated), and could not leave; so I was obliged to go up to Gaston all alone, when the session commenced.  There were but four of us Assemblywomen, and although the men treated us with great courtesy, I was that nervous that I seemed to detect either commiseration or satire everywhere.  Before I had even taken my seat, I was addressed by fifteen or twenty different gentlemen, either great capitalists, or great engineers, or distinguished lawyers, all interested in various schemes for developing the resources of our State by new railroads, canals or ferries.  I then began to comprehend the grandeur of the Legislator's office.  My voice could assist in making possible these magnificent improvements, and I promised it to all.  Mr. Filch, President of the Shinnebaug and Great Western Consolidated Line, was so delighted with my appreciation of his plan for reducing the freight on grain from Nebraska, that he must have written extravagant accounts of me to his wife; for she sent me, at Christmas, one of the loveliest shawls I ever beheld.\\n\\nI had frequently made short addresses at our public meetings, and was considered to have my share of self-possession; but I never could accustom myself to the keen, disturbing, irritating atmosphere of the Legislature.  Everybody seemed wide-awake and aggressive, instead of pleasantly receptive; there were so many \\\"points of order,\\\" and what not; such complete disregard, among the members, of each other's feelings; and, finally--a thing I could never understand, indeed--such inconsistency and lack of principle in the intercourse of the two parties.  How could I feel assured of their sincerity, when I saw the very men chatting and laughing together, in the lobbies, ten minutes after they had been facing each other like angry lions in the debate?\\n\\nMrs. Whiston, also, had her trials of the same character.  Nothing ever annoyed her so much as a little blunder she made, the week after the opening of the session.  I have not yet mentioned that there was already a universal dissatisfaction among the women, on account of their being liable to military service.  The war seemed to have hardly begun, as yet, and conscription was already talked about; the women, therefore, clamored for an exemption on account of sex.  Although we all felt that this was a retrograde movement, the pressure was so great that we yielded.  Mrs. Whiston, reluctant at first, no sooner made up her mind that the thing must be done, than she furthered it with all her might.  After several attempts to introduce a bill, which were always cut off by some \\\"point of order,\\\" she unhappily lost her usual patience.\\n\\nI don't know that I can exactly explain how it happened, for what the men call \\\"parliamentary tactics\\\" always made me fidgetty.  But the \\\"previous question\\\" turned up (as it always seemed to me to do, at the wrong time), and cut her off before she had spoken ten words.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Speaker!\\\" she protested; \\\"there is no question, previous to this, which needs the consideration of the house!  This is first in importance, and demands your immediate--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Order! order!\\\" came from all parts of the house.\\n\\n\\\"I am in order--the right is always in order!\\\" she exclaimed, getting more and more excited.  \\\"We women are not going to be contented with the mere show of our rights on this floor; we demand the substance--\\\"\\n\\nAnd so she was going on, when there arose the most fearful tumult.  The upshot of it was, that the speaker ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove Mrs. Whiston; one of the members, more considerate, walked across the floor to her, and tried to explain in what manner she was violating the rules; and in another minute she sat down, so white, rigid and silent that it made me shake in my shoes to look at her.\\n\\n\\\"I have made a great blunder,\\\" she said to me, that evening; \\\"and it may set us back a little; but I shall recover my ground.\\\"  Which she did, I assure you.  She cultivated the acquaintance of the leaders of both parties, studied their tactics, and quietly waited for a good opportunity to bring in her bill.  At first, we thought it would pass; but one of the male members presently came out with a speech, which dashed our hopes to nothing.  He simply took the ground that there must be absolute equality in citizenship; that every privilege was balanced by a duty, every trust accompanied with its responsibility.  He had no objection to women possessing equal rights with men--but to give them all civil rights and exempt them from the most important obligation of service, would be, he said, to create a privileged class--a female aristocracy.  It was contrary to the spirit of our institutions.  The women had complained of taxation without representation; did they now claim the latter without the former?\\n\\nThe people never look more than half-way into a subject, and so this speech was immensely popular.  I will not give Mrs. Whiston's admirable reply; for Mr. Spelter informs me that you will not accept an article, if it should make more than seventy or eighty printed pages.  It is enough that our bill was \\\"killed,\\\" as the men say (a brutal word); and the women of the State laid the blame of the failure upon us.  You may imagine that we suffered under this injustice; but worse was to come.\\n\\nAs I said before, a great many things came up in the Legislature which I did not understand--and, to be candid, did not care to understand.  But I was obliged to vote, nevertheless, and in this extremity I depended pretty much on Mrs. Whiston's counsel.  We could not well go to the private nightly confabs of the members--indeed, they did not invite us; and when it came to the issue of State bonds, bank charters, and such like, I felt as if I were blundering along in the dark.\\n\\nOne day, I received, to my immense astonishment, a hundred and more letters, all from the northern part of our county.  I opened them, one after the other, and--well, it is beyond my power to tell you what varieties of indignation and abuse fell upon me.  It seems that I had voted against the bill to charter the Mendip Extension Railroad Co.  I had been obliged to vote for or against so many things, that it was impossible to recollect them all.  However, I procured the printed journal, and, sure enough! there, among the nays, was \\\"Strongitharm.\\\"  It was not a week after that--and I was still suffering in mind and body--when the newspapers in the interest of the Rancocus and Great Western Consolidated accused me (not by name, but the same thing--you know how they do it) of being guilty of taking bribes.  Mr. Filch, of the Shinnebaug Consolidated had explained to me so beautifully the superior advantages of his line, that the Directors of the other company took their revenge in this vile, abominable way.\\n\\nThat was only the beginning of my trouble.  What with these slanders and longing for the quiet of our dear old home at Burroak, I was almost sick; yet the Legislature sat on, and sat on, until I was nearly desperate.  Then one morning came a despatch from my husband:  \\\"Melissa is drafted--come home!\\\"  How I made the journey I can't tell; I was in an agony of apprehension, and when Mr. Strongitharm and Melissa both met me at the Burroak Station, well and smiling, I fell into a hysterical fit of laughing and crying, for the first time in my life.\\n\\nBilly Brandon, who was engaged to Melissa, came forward and took her place like a man; he fought none the worse, let me tell you, because he represented a woman, and (I may as well say it now) he came home a Captain, without a left arm--but Melissa seems to have three arms for his sake.\\n\\nYou have no idea what a confusion and lamentation there was all over the State.  A good many women were drafted, and those who could neither get substitutes for love nor money, were marched to Gaston, where the recruiting Colonel was considerate enough to give them a separate camp.  In a week, however, the word came from Washington that the Army Regulations of the United States did not admit of their being received; and they came home blessing Mr. Stanton.  This was the end of drafting women in our State.\\n\\nNevertheless, the excitement created by the draft did not subside at once.  It was seized upon by the Democratic leaders, as part of a plan already concocted, which they then proceeded to set in operation.  It succeeded only too well, and I don't know when we shall ever see the end of it.\\n\\nWe had more friends among the Republicans at the start, because all the original Abolitionists in the State came into that party in 1860.  Our success had been so rapid and unforeseen that the Democrats continued their opposition even after female suffrage was an accomplished fact; but the leaders were shrewd enough to see that another such election as the last would ruin their party in the State.  So their trains were quietly laid, and the match was not applied until all Atlantic was ringing with the protestations of the unwilling conscripts and the laments of their families.  Then came, like three claps of thunder in one, sympathy for the women, acquiescence in their rights, and invitations to them, everywhere, to take part in the Democratic caucuses and conventions.  Most of the prominent women of the State were deluded for a time by this manifestation, and acted with the party for the sake of the sex.\\n\\nI had no idea, however, what the practical result of this movement would be, until, a few weeks before election, I was calling upon Mrs. Buckwalter, and happened to express my belief that we Republicans were going to carry the State again, by a large majority.\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad of it,\\\" said she, with an expression of great relief, \\\"because then my vote will not be needed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why!\\\" I exclaimed; \\\"you won't decline to vote, surely?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Worse than that,\\\" she answered, \\\"I am afraid I shall have to vote with the other side.\\\"\\n\\nNow as I knew her to be a good Republican, I could scarcely believe my ears.  She blushed, I must admit, when she saw my astonished face.\\n\\n\\\"I'm so used to Bridget, you know,\\\" she continued, \\\"and good girls are so very hard to find, nowadays.  She has as good as said that she won't stay a day later than election, if I don't vote for HER candidate; and what am I to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do without!\\\" I said shortly, getting up in my indignation.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that's very well for you, with your wonderful PHYSIQUE,\\\" said Mrs. Buckwalter, quietly, \\\"but think of me with my neuralgia, and the pain in my back!  It would be a dreadful blow, if I should lose Bridget.\\\"\\n\\nWell--what with torch-light processions, and meetings on both sides, Burroak was in such a state of excitement when election came, that most of the ladies of my acquaintance were almost afraid to go to the polls.  I tried to get them out during the first hours after sunrise, when I went myself, but in vain.  Even that early, I heard things that made me shudder.  Those who came later, went home resolved to give up their rights rather than undergo a second experience of rowdyism.  But it was a jubilee for the servant girls.  Mrs. Buckwalter didn't gain much by her apostasy, for Bridget came home singing \\\"The Wearing of the Green,\\\" and let fall a whole tray full of the best china before she could be got to bed.\\n\\nBurroak, which, the year before, had a Republican majority of three hundred, now went for the Democrats by more than five hundred.  The same party carried the State, electing their Governor by near twenty thousand.  The Republicans would now have gladly repealed the bill giving us equal rights, but they were in a minority, and the Democrats refused to co-operate.  Mrs. Whiston, who still remained loyal to our side, collected information from all parts of the State, from which it appeared that four-fifths of all the female citizens had voted the Democratic ticket.  In New Lisbon, our great manufacturing city, with its population of nearly one hundred thousand, the party gained three thousand votes, while the accessions to the Republican ranks were only about four hundred.\\n\\nMrs. Whiston barely escaped being defeated; her majority was reduced from seven hundred to forty-three.  Eleven Democratic Assemblywomen and four Senatoresses were chosen, however, so that she had the consolation of knowing that her sex had gained, although her party had lost.  She was still in good spirits:  \\\"It will all right itself in time,\\\" she said.\\n\\nYou will readily guess, after what I have related, that I was not only not re-elected to the Legislature, but that I was not even a candidate.  I could have born the outrageous attacks of the opposite party; but the treatment I had received from my own \\\"constituents\\\" (I shall always hate the word) gave me a new revelation of the actual character of political life.  I have not mentioned half the worries and annoyances to which I was subjected--the endless, endless letters and applications for office, or for my influence in some way--the abuse and threats when I could not possibly do what was desired--the exhibitions of selfishness and disregard of all great and noble principles--and finally, the shameless advances which were made by what men call \\\"the lobby,\\\" to secure my vote for this, that, and the other thing.\\n\\nWhy, it fairly made my hair stand on end to hear the stories which the pleasant men, whom I thought so grandly interested in schemes for \\\"the material development of the country,\\\" told about each other.  Mrs. Filch's shawl began to burn my shoulders before I had worn it a half a dozen times.  (I have since given it to Melissa, as a wedding-present).\\n\\nBefore the next session was half over, I was doubly glad of being safe at home.  Mrs. Whiston supposed that the increased female representation would give her more support, and indeed it seemed so, at first.  But after her speech on the Bounty bill, only two of the fifteen Democratic women would even speak to her, and all hope of concord of action in the interests of women was at an end.  We read the debates, and my blood fairly boiled when I found what taunts and sneers, and epithets she was forced to endure.  I wondered how she could sit still under them.\\n\\nTo make her position worse, the adjoining seat was occupied by an Irishwoman, who had been elected by the votes of the laborers on the new Albemarle Extension, in the neighborhood of which she kept a grocery store.  Nelly Kirkpatrick was a great, red-haired giant of a woman, very illiterate, but with some native wit, and good- hearted enough, I am told, when she was in her right mind.  She always followed the lead of Mr. Gorham (whose name, you see, came before hers in the call), and a look from him was generally sufficient to quiet her when she was inclined to be noisy.\\n\\nWhen the resolutions declaring the war a failure were introduced, the party excitement ran higher than ever.  The \\\"lunch-room\\\" (as they called it--I never went there but once, the title having deceived me) in the basement-story of the State House was crowded during the discussion, and every time Nelly Kirkpatrick came up, her face was a shade deeper red.  Mr. Gorham's nods and winks were of no avail--speak she would, and speak she did, not so very incoherently, after all, but very abusively.  To be sure, you would never have guessed it, if you had read the quiet and dignified report in the papers on her side, the next day.\\n\\nTHEN Mrs. Whiston's patience broke down.  \\\"Mr. Speaker,\\\" she exclaimed, starting to her feet, \\\"I protest against this House being compelled to listen to such a tirade as has just been delivered.  Are we to be disgraced before the world--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, hoo!  Disgraced, is it?\\\" yelled Nelly Kirkpatrick, violently interrupting her, \\\"and me as dacent a woman as ever she was, or ever will be!  Disgraced, hey?  Oh, I'll larn her what it is to blaggard her betters!\\\"\\n\\nAnd before anybody could imagine what was coming, she pounced upon Mrs. Whiston, with one jerk ripped off her skirt (it was silk, not serge, this time), seized her by the hair, and gave her head such a twist backwards, that the chignon not only came off in her hands, but as her victim opened her mouth too widely in the struggle, the springs of her false teeth were sprung the wrong way, and the entire set flew out and rattled upon the floor.\\n\\nOf course there were cries of \\\"Order!  Order!\\\" and the nearest members--Mr. Gorham among the first--rushed in; but the mischief was done.  Mrs. Whiston had always urged upon our minds the necessity of not only being dressed according to the popular fashion, but also as elegantly and becomingly as possible.  \\\"If we adopt the Bloomers,\\\" she said, \\\"we shall never get our rights, while the world stands.  Where it is necessary to influence men, we must be wholly and truly WOMEN, not semi-sexed nondescripts; we must employ every charm Nature gives us and Fashion adds, not hide them under a forked extinguisher!\\\"  I give her very words to show you her way of looking at things.  Well, now imagine this elegant woman, looking not a day over forty, though she was--but no, I have no right to tell it,--imagine her, I say, with only her scanty natural hair hanging over her ears, her mouth dreadfully fallen in, her skirt torn off, all in open day, before the eyes of a hundred and fifty members (and I am told they laughed immensely, in spite of the scandal that it was), and, if you are human beings, you will feel that she must have been wounded to the very heart.\\n\\nThere was a motion made to expel Nelly Kirkpatrick, and perhaps it might have succeeded--but the railroad hands, all over the State, made a heroine of her, and her party was afraid of losing five or six thousand votes; so only a mild censure was pronounced.  But there was no end to the caricatures, and songs, and all sorts of ribaldry, about the occurrence; and even our party said that, although Mrs. Whiston was really and truly a martyr, yet the circumstance was an immense damage to THEM.  When she heard THAT, I believe it killed her.  She resigned her seat, went home, never appeared again in public, and died within a year.  \\\"My dear friend,\\\" she wrote to me, not a month before her death, \\\"I have been trying all my life to get a thorough knowledge of the masculine nature, but my woman's plummet will not reach to the bottom of that chaotic pit of selfishness and principle, expedience and firmness for the right, brutality and tenderness, gullibility and devilish shrewdness, which I have tried to sound.  Only one thing is clear--we women cannot do without what we have sometimes, alas! sneered at as THE CHIVELRY OF THE SEX.  The question of our rights is as clear to me as ever; but we must find a plan to get them without being forced to share, or even to SEE, all that men do in their political lives.  We have only beheld some Principle riding aloft, not the mud through which her chariot wheels are dragged.  The ways must be swept before we can walk in them--but how and by whom shall this be done?\\\"\\n\\nFor my part, *I* can't say, and I wish somebody would tell me.\\n\\nWell--after seeing our State, which we used to be proud of, delivered over for two years to the control of a party whose policy was so repugnant to all our feelings of loyalty, we endeavored to procure, at least a qualification of intelligence for voters.  Of course, we didn't get it: the exclusion from suffrage of all who were unable to read and write might have turned the scales again, and given us the State.  After our boys came back from the war, we might have succeeded--but their votes were over- balanced by those of the servant-girls, every one of whom turned out, making a whole holiday of the election.\\n\\nI thought, last fall, that my Maria, who is German, would have voted with us.  I stayed at home and did the work myself, on purpose that she might hear the oration of Carl Schurz; but old Hammer, who keeps the lager-beer saloon in the upper end of Burroak, gave a supper and a dance to all the German girls and their beaux, after the meeting, and so managed to secure nine out of ten of their votes for Seymour.  Maria proposed going away a week before election, up into Decatur County, where, she said, some relations, just arrived from Bavaria, had settled.  I was obliged to let her go, or lose her altogether, but I was comforted by the thought that if her vote were lost for Grant, at least it could not be given to Seymour.  After the election was over, and Decatur County, which we had always managed to carry hitherto, went against us, the whole matter was explained.  About five hundred girls, we were informed, had been COLONIZED in private families, as extra help, for a fortnight, and of course Maria was one of them.  (I have looked at the addresses of her letters, ever since, and not one has she sent to Decatur).  A committee has been appointed, and a report made on the election frauds in our State, and we shall see, I suppose, whether any help comes of it.\\n\\nNow, you mustn't think, from all this, that I am an apostate from the principle of Women's Rights.  No, indeed!  All the trouble we have had, as I think will be evident to the millions who read my words, comes from THE MEN.  They have not only made politics their monopoly, but they have fashioned it into a tremendous, elaborate system, in which there is precious little of either principle or honesty.  We can and we MUST \\\"run the machine\\\" (to use another of their vulgar expressions) with them, until we get a chance to knock off the useless wheels and thingumbobs, and scour the whole concern, inside and out.  Perhaps the men themselves would like to do this, if they only knew how: men have so little talent for cleaning-up.  But when it comes to making a litter, they're at home, let me tell you!\\n\\nMeanwhile, in our State, things are about as bad as they can be.  The women are drawn for juries, the same as ever, but (except in Whittletown, where they have a separate room,) no respectable woman goes, and the fines come heavy on some of us.  The demoralization among our help is so bad, that we are going to try Co-operative Housekeeping.  If that don't succeed, I shall get brother Samuel, who lives in California, to send me two Chinamen, one for cook and chamber-boy, and one as nurse for Melissa.  I console myself with thinking that the end of it all must be good, since the principle is right: but, dear me!  I had no idea that I should be called upon to go through such tribulation.\\n\\nNow the reason I write--and I suppose I must hurry to the end, or you will be out of all patience--is to beg, and insist, and implore my sisters in other States to lose no more time, but at once to coax, or melt, or threaten the men into accepting their claims.  We are now so isolated in our rights that we are obliged to bear more than our proper share of the burden.  When the States around us shall be so far advanced, there will be a chance for new stateswomen to spring up, and fill Mrs. Whiston's place, and we shall then, I firmly believe, devise a plan to cleanse the great Augean stable of politics by turning into it the river of female honesty and intelligence and morality.  But they must do this, somehow or other, without letting the river be tainted by the heaps of pestilent offal it must sweep away.  As Lord Bacon says (in that play falsely attributed to Shakespeare)--\\\"Ay, there's the rub!\\\"\\n\\nIf you were to ask me, NOW, what effect the right of suffrage, office, and all the duties of men has had upon the morals of the women of our State, I should be puzzled what to say.  It is something like this--if you put a chemical purifying agent into a bucket of muddy water, the water gets clearer, to be sure, but the chemical substance takes up some of the impurity.  Perhaps that's rather too strong a comparison; but if you say that men are worse than women, as most people do, then of course we improve them by closer political intercourse, and lose a little ourselves in the process.  I leave you to decide the relative loss and gain.  To tell you the truth, this is a feature of the question which I would rather not discuss; and I see, by the reports of the recent Conventions, that all the champions of our sex feel the same way.\\n\\nWell, since I must come to an end somewhere, let it be here.  To quote Lord Bacon again, take my \\\"round, unvarnished tale,\\\" and perhaps the world will yet acknowledge that some good has been done by                     Yours truly,                             JANE STRONGITHARM.\",\"timestamp\":1640142016,\"title\":\"If that's all, make yourself easy, Bet,\\\" Henry answered, as he rose from the table.\"},\"digest\":\"Fo06Ro2VAf1el4AqGghPv_gs2YdzAywXYb8hGsR6uxY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x90172af57cfCfbdA1dac8055668d7B5df7f90f1E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"87PA9Ssb4BnRRs5WlFh6M-FKeyQbHfiyajzlaGmj_8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"osP-mswcR77TuKqR1dK644bIMIHImyr7qQOGtWryt_o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ui6ComIse5USo1vOhY6RrY6FSvWsT7INrTwijqhuTTh8XjesXr2phYMt1ZjhX-yZwz0pex0Tzg1kGoIjt_DI9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3a011fd8a8f8c1f467a45b6169514e05e406f4e22aa64721ac3c9bb012554d56316127627fb24292941453b4931388783e078862d9bd32c8c656a255853195291c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"87PA9Ssb4BnRRs5WlFh6M-FKeyQbHfiyajzlaGmj_8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"osP-mswcR77TuKqR1dK644bIMIHImyr7qQOGtWryt_o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Fo06Ro2VAf1el4AqGghPv_gs2YdzAywXYb8hGsR6uxY\"}"
