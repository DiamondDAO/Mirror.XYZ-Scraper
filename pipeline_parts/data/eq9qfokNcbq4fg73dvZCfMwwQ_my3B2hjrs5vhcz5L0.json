"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It was a high, brick building, and it was\\ncalled the Fairport House. As I was running along the sidewalk, I heard some one\\nspeak to me, and looking up I saw Charlie Montague. I had heard the Morrises say\\nthat his parents were staying at the hotel for a few weeks, while their house\\nwas being repaired. He had his Irish setter, Brisk, with him, and a handsome dog\\nhe was, as he stood waving his silky tail in the sunlight. Charlie patted me,\\nand then he and his dog went into the hotel. I turned into the stable yard. It\\nwas a small, choked-up place, and as I picked my way under the cabs and wagons\\nstanding in the yard, I wondered why the hotel people didn't buy some of the old\\nhouses near by, and tear them down, and make a stable yard worthy of such a nice\\nhotel. The hotel horses were just getting rubbed down after their day's work,\\nand others were coming in. The men were talking and laughing, and there was no\\nsign of strange animals, so I went around to the back of the yard. Here they\\nwere, in an empty cow stable, under a hay loft. There were two little ponies\\ntied up in a stall, two goats beyond them, and dogs and monkeys in strong\\ntraveling cages. I stood in the doorway and stared at them. I was sorry for the\\ndogs to be shut up on such a lovely evening, but I suppose their master was\\nafraid of their getting lost, or being stolen, if he let them loose.\\n\\nThey all seemed very friendly. The ponies turned around and looked at me with\\ntheir gentle eyes, and then went on munching their hay. I wondered very much\\nwhere the gander was, and went a little farther into the stable. Something white\\nraised itself up out of the brownest pony's crib, and there was the gander close\\nup beside the open mouth of his friend. The monkeys make a jabbering noise, and\\nheld on to the bars of their cage with their little black hands, while they\\nlooked out at me. The dogs sniffed the air, and wagged their tails, and tried to\\nput their muzzles through the bars of their cage. I liked the dogs best, and I\\nwanted to see the one they called Bob, so I went up quite close to them. There\\nwere two little white dogs, something like Billy, two mongrel spaniels, an Irish\\nterrier, and a brown dog asleep in the corner, that I knew must be Bob. He did\\nlook a little like me, but he was not quite so ugly for he had his ears and his\\ntail.\\n\\nWhile I was peering through the bars at him, a man came in the stable. He\\nnoticed me the first thing, but instead of driving me out, he spoke kindly to\\nme, in a language that I did not understand. So I knew that he was the Italian.\\nHow glad the animals were to see him! The gander fluttered out of his nest, the\\nponies pulled at their halters, the dogs whined and tried to reach his hands to\\nlick them, and the monkeys chattered with delight. He laughed and talked back to\\nthem in queer, soft-sounding words. Then he took out of a bag on his arm, bones\\nfor the dogs, nuts and cakes for the monkeys, nice, juicy carrots for the\\nponies, some green stuff for the goats, and corn for the gander.\\n\\nIt was a pretty sight to see the old man feeding his pets, and it made me feel\\nquite hungry, so I trotted home. I had a run down town again that evening with\\nMr. Morris, who went to get something from a shop for his wife. He never let his\\nboys go to town after tea, so if there were errands to be done, he or Mrs.\\nMorris went. The town was bright and lively that evening, and a great many\\npeople were walking about and looking into the shop windows.\\n\\nWhen we came home, I went into the kennel with Jim, and there I slept till the\\nmiddle of the night. Then I started up and ran outside. There was a distant bell\\nringing, which we often heard in Fairport, and which always meant fire.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXIV  A FIRE IN FAIRPORT\\n\\nI HAD several times run to a fire with the boys, and knew that there was always\\ngreat noise and excitement. There was a light in the house, so I knew that\\nsomebody was getting up. I don't think indeed I know, for they were good boys\\nthat they ever wanted anybody to lose property, but they did enjoy seeing a\\nblaze, and one of their greatest delights, when there hadn't been a fire for\\nsome time, was to build a bonfire in the garden.\\n\\nJim and I ran around to the front of the house and waited. In a few minutes,\\nsome one came rattling at the front door, and I was sure it was Jack. But it was\\nMr. Morris, and without a word to us, he set off almost running toward the town.\\nWe followed after him, and as we hurried along other men ran out from the houses\\nalong the streets, and either joined him; or dashed ahead. They seemed to have\\ndressed in a hurry, and were thrusting their arms in their coats, and buttoning\\nthemselves up as they went. Some of them had hats and some of them had none, and\\nthey all had their faces toward the great red light that got brighter and\\nbrighter ahead of us. \\\"Where's the fire?\\\" they shouted to each other. \\\"Don't\\nknow afraid it' s the hotel, or the town hall. It's such a blaze. Hope not.\\nHow's the water supply now? Bad time for a fire.\\\"\\n\\nIt was the hotel. We saw that as soon as we got on to the main street. There\\nwere people all about, and a great noise and confusion, and smoke and blackness;\\nand up above, bright tongues of flame were leaping against the sky. Jim and I\\nkept close to Mr. Morris's heels, as he pushed his way among the crowd. When we\\ngot nearer the burning building, we saw men carrying ladders and axes, and\\nothers were shouting directions, and rushing out of the hotel, carrying boxes\\nand bundles and furniture in their arms. From the windows above came a steady\\nstream of articles, thrown among the crowd. A mirror struck Mr. Morris on the\\narm, and a whole package of clothes fell on his head and almost smothered him;\\nbut he brushed them aside and scarcely noticed them. There was something the\\nmatter with Mr. Morris I knew by the worried sound of his voice when he spoke to\\nany one. I could not see his face, though it was as light as day about us, for\\nwe had got jammed in the crowd, and if I had not kept between his feet, I should\\nhave been trodden to death. Jim, being larger than I was, had got separated from\\nus.\\n\\nPresently Mr. Morris raised his voice above the uproar, and called, \\\"Is every\\none out of the hotel?\\\" A voice shouted back, \\\"I'm going up to see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's Jim Watson, the fireman,\\\" cried some one near. \\\"He's risking his life to\\ngo into that pit of flame. Don't go, Watson.\\\" I don't think that the brave\\nfireman paid any attention to this warning, for an instant later the same voice\\nsaid \\\"He's planting his ladder against the third story. He's bound to go. He'll\\nnot get any farther than the second, anyway.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where are the Montagues?\\\" shouted Mr. Morris. \\\"Has any one seen the Montagues?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Morris! Mr. Morris!\\\" said a frightened voice, and young Charlie Montague\\npressed through the people to us. \\\"Where's papa?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. Where did you leave him?\\\" said Mr. Morris, taking his hand and\\ndrawing him closer to him. \\\"I was sleeping in his room,\\\" said the boy, \\\"and a\\nman knocked at the door and said, 'Hotel on fire. Five minutes to dress and get\\nout,' and papa told me to put on my clothes and go downstairs, and he ran up to\\nmamma.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where was she?\\\" asked Mr. Morris, quickly.\\n\\n\\\"On the fourth flat. She and her maid Blanche were up there. You know, mamma\\nhasn't been well and couldn't sleep, and our room was so noisy that she moved\\nupstairs where it was quiet.\\\" Mr. Morris gave a kind of groan. \\\"Oh I'm so hot,\\nand there's such a dreadful noise,\\\" said the little boy, bursting into tears,\\n\\\"and I want mamma.\\\" Mr. Morris soothed him as best he could, and drew him a\\nlittle to the edge of the crowd.\\n\\nWhile he was doing this, there was a piercing cry. I could not see the person\\nmaking it, but I knew it was the Italian's voice. He was screaming, in broken\\nEnglish that the fire was spreading to the stables, and his animals would be\\nburned. Would no one help him to get his animals out? There was a great deal of\\nconfused language. Some voices shouted, \\\"Look after the people first. Let the\\nanimals go.\\\" And others said, \\\"For shame. Get the horses out.\\\" But no one seemed\\nto do anything, for the Italian went on crying for help. I heard a number of\\npeople who were standing near us say that it had just been found out that\\nseveral persons who had been sleeping in the top of the hotel had not got out.\\nThey said that at one of the top windows a poor housemaid was shrieking for\\nhelp. Here in the street we could see no one at the upper windows, for smoke was\\npouring from them.\\n\\nThe air was very hot and heavy and I didn't wonder that Charlie Montague felt\\nill. He would have fallen on the ground if Mr. Morris hadn't taken him in his\\narms, and carried him out of the crowd. He put him down on the brick sidewalk,\\nand unfastened his little shirt, and left me to watch him, while he held his\\nhands under a leak in a hose that was fastened to a hydrant near us. He got\\nenough water to dash on Charlie's face and breast, and then seeing that the boy\\nwas reviving, he sat down on the curbstone and took him on his knee. Charlie lay\\nin his arms and moaned. He was a delicate boy, and he could not stand rough\\nusage as the Morris boys could.\\n\\nMr. Morris was terribly uneasy. His face was deathly white, and he shuddered\\nwhenever there was a cry from the burning building. \\\"Poor souls God help them.\\nOh, this is awful,\\\" he said; and then he turned his eyes from the great sheets\\nof flame and strained the little boy to his breast. At last there were wild\\nshrieks that I knew came from no human throats. The fire must have reached the\\nhorses. Mr. Morris sprang up, then sank back again. He wanted to go, yet he\\ncould be of no use. There were hundreds of men standing about, but the fire had\\nspread so rapidly, and they had so little water to put on it that there was very\\nlittle they could do. I wondered whether I could do anything for the poor\\nanimals. I was not afraid of fire, as most dogs, for one of the tricks that the\\nMorris boys had taught me was to put out a fire with my paws. They would throw a\\npiece of lighted paper on the floor, and I would crush it with my forepaws; and\\nif the blaze was too large for that, I would drag a bit of old carpet over it\\nand jump on it. I left Mr. Morris, and ran around the corner of the street to\\nthe back of the hotel. It was not burned as much here as in the front, and in\\nthe houses all around, people were out on their roofs with wet blankets, and\\nsome were standing at the window watching the fire, or packing up their\\nbelongings ready to move if it should spread to them. There was a narrow lane\\nrunning up a short distance toward the hotel, and I started to go up this, when\\nin front of me I heard such a wailing, piercing noise, that it made me shudder\\nand stand still. The Italian's animals were going to be burned up and they were\\ncalling to their master to come and get them out. Their voices sounded like the\\nvoices of children in mortal pain. I could not stand it. I was seized with such\\nan awful horror of the fire that I turned and ran, feeling so thankful that I\\nwas not in it. As I got into the street I stumbled over something. It was a\\nlarge bird a parrot, and at first I thought it was Bella. Then I remembered\\nhearing Jack say that the Italian had a parrot. It was not dead, but seemed\\nstupid with the smoke. I seized it in my mouth, and ran and laid it at Mr.\\nMorris's feet. He wrapped it in his handkerchief, and laid it beside him.\\n\\nI sat, and trembled, and did not leave him again. I shall never forget that\\ndreadful night. It seemed as if we were there for hours, but in reality it was\\nonly a short time. The hotel soon got to be all red flames, and there was very\\nlittle smoke. The inside of the budding had burned away, and nothing more could\\nbe gotten out. The firemen and all the people drew back, and there was no noise.\\nEverybody stood gazing silently at the flames. A man stepped quietly up to Mr.\\nMorris, and looking at him, I saw that it was Mr. Montague. He was usually a\\nwell-dressed man, with a kind face, and a head of thick, grayish brown hair. Now\\nhis face was black and grimy, his hair was burnt from the front of his head, and\\nhis clothes were half torn from his back. Mr. Morris sprang up when he saw him,\\nand said \\\"Where is your wife?\\\"\\n\\nThe gentleman did not say a word, but pointed to the burning building.\\n\\\"Impossible!\\\" cried Mr. Morris. \\\"Is there no mistake? Your beautiful young wife,\\nMontague. Can it be so?\\\" Mr. Morris was trembling from head to foot.\\n\\n\\\"It is true,\\\" said Mr. Montague, quietly. \\\"Give me the boy.\\\" Charlie had fainted\\nagain and his father took him in his arms, and turned away.\\n\\n\\\"Montague!\\\" cried Mr. Morris, \\\"my heart is sore for you. Can I do nothing?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, thank you,\\\" said the gentleman, without turning around; but there was more\\nanguish in his voice than in Mr. Morris's, and though I am only a, dog, I knew\\nthat his heart was breaking.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXV  BILLY AND THE ITALIAN\\n\\nMR. MORRIS stayed no longer. He followed Mr. Montague along the sidewalk a\\nlittle way, and then exchanged a few hurried words with some men who were\\nstanding near, and hastened home through streets that seemed dark and dull after\\nthe splendor of the fire. Though it was still the middle of the night, Mrs.\\nMorris was up and dressed and waiting for him. She opened the hall door with one\\nhand and held a candle in the other. I felt frightened and miserable, and didn't\\nwant to leave Mr. Morris, so I crept in after him.\\n\\n\\\"Don't make a noise,\\\" said Mrs. Morris. \\\"Laura and the boys are sleeping, and I\\nthought it better not to wake them. It has been a terrible fire, hasn't it? Was\\nit the hotel?\\\" Mr. Morris threw himself into a chair and covered his face with\\nhis hands.\\n\\n\\\"Speak to me, William!\\\" said Mrs. Morris, in a startled tone. \\\"You are not hurt,\\nare you?\\\" and she put her candle on the table and came and sat down beside him.\\n\\nHe dropped his hands from his face, and tears were running down his cheeks. \\\"Ten\\nlives lost,\\\" he said; \\\"among them Mrs. Montague.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Morris looked horrified, and gave a little cry, \\\"William, it can't be so!\\\"\\n\\nIt seemed as if Mr. Morris could not sit still. He got up and walked to and fro\\non the floor. \\\"It was an awful scene, Margaret. I never wish to look upon the\\nlike again. Do you remember how I protested against the building of that\\ndeathtrap. Look at the wide, open streets around it, and yet they persisted in\\nrunning it up to the sky. God will require an account of those deaths at the\\nhands of the men who put up that building. It is terrible this disregard of\\nhuman lives. To think of that delicate woman and her death agony.\\\" He threw\\nhimself in a chair and buried his face in his hands.\\n\\n\\\"Where was she? How did it happen? Was her husband saved, and Charlie?\\\" said\\nMrs. Morris, in a broken voice.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; Charlie and Mr. Montague are safe. Charlie will recover from it.\\nMontague's life is done. You know his love for his wife. Oh, Margaret! when will\\nmen cease to be fools? What does the Lord think of them when they say, 'Am I my\\nbrother's keeper?' And the other poor creatures burned to death their lives are\\nas precious in his sight as Mrs. Montague's.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Morris looked so weak and ill that Mrs. Morris, like a sensible woman,\\nquestioned him no further, but made a fire and got him some hot tea. Then she\\nmade him lie down on the sofa, and she sat by him till day-break, when she\\npersuaded him to go to bed. I followed her about, and kept touching her dress\\nwith my nose. It seemed so good to me to have this pleasant home after all the\\nmisery I had seen that night. Once she stopped and took my head between her\\nhands, \\\"Dear old Joe,\\\" she said, tearfully, \\\"this a suffering world. It's well\\nthere's a better one beyond it.\\\"\\n\\nIn the morning the boys went down town before breakfast and learned all about\\nthe fire. It started in the top story of the hotel, in the room of some fast\\nyoung men, who were sitting up late playing cards. They had smuggled wine into\\ntheir room and had been drinking till they were stupid. One of them upset the\\nlamp, and when the flames began to spread so that they could not extinguish\\nthem, instead of rousing some one near them, they rushed downstairs to get some\\none there to come up and help them put out the fire. When they returned with\\nsome of the hotel people, they found that the flames had spread from their room,\\nwhich was in an \\\"L\\\" at the back of the house, to the front part, where Mrs.\\nMontague's room was, and where the housemaids belonging to the hotel slept. By\\nthis time Mr. Montague had gotten upstairs, but he found the passageway to his\\nwife's room so full of flames and smoke, that, though he tried again and again\\nto force his way through, he could not. He disappeared for a time, then he came\\nto Mr. Morris and got his boy, and took him to some rooms over his bank, and\\nshut himself up with him. For some days he would let no one in; then he came out\\nwith the look of an old man on his face, and his hair as white as snow, and went\\nout to his beautiful house in the outskirts of the town.\\n\\nNearly all the horses belonging to the hotel were burned. A few were gotten out\\nby having blankets put over their heads, but the most of them were so terrified\\nthat they would not stir.\\n\\nThe Morris boys said that they found the old Italian sitting on an empty box,\\nlooking at the smoking ruins of the hotel. His head was hanging on his breast,\\nand his eyes were full of tears. His ponies were burned up, he said, and the\\ngander, and the monkeys, and the goat, and his wonderful performing dogs. He had\\nonly his birds left, and he was a ruined man. He had toiled all his life to get\\nthis troupe of trained animals together, and now they were swept from him. It\\nwas cruel and wicked, and he wished he could die. The canaries, and pigeons, and\\ndoves, the hotel people had allowed him to take to his room, and they were safe.\\nThe parrot was lost an educated parrot that could answer forty questions, and,\\namong other things, could take a watch and tell the time of day.\\n\\nJack Morris told him that they had it safe at home, and that it was very much\\nalive, quarrelling furiously with his parrot Bella. The old man's face\\nbrightened at this, and then Jack and Carl, finding that he had had no\\nbreakfast, went off to a restaurant near by, and got him some steak and coffee.\\nThe Italian was very grateful, and as he ate, Jack said the tears ran into his\\ncoffee cap. He told them how much he loved his animals, and how it \\\"made ze\\nheart bitter to hear zem crying him to deliver zem from ze raging fire.\\\"\\n\\nThe boys came home, and got their breakfast and went to school. Miss Laura did\\nnot go out She sat all day with a very quiet, pained face and could neither read\\nnor sew, and Mr. and Mrs. Morris were just as unsettled. They talked about the\\nfire in low tones, and I could see that they felt more sad about Mrs. Montague's\\ndeath than if she had died in an ordinary way. Her dear little canary Barry,\\ndied with her. She would never be separated from him, and his cage had been\\ntaken up to the top of the hotel with her. He probably died an easier death than\\nhis poor mistress. Charley's dog escaped, but was so frightened that he ran out\\nto their house, outside the town.\\n\\nAt tea time, Mr. Morris went down town to see that the Italian got a comfortable\\nplace for the night. When he came back, he said that he had found out that the\\nItalian was by no means so old a man as he looked and that he had talked to him\\nabout raising a sum of money for him among the Fairport people, till he had\\nbecome quite cheerful, and said that if Mr. Morris would do that, he would try\\nto gather another troupe of animals together and train them.\\n\\n\\\"Now, what can we do for the Italian?\\\" asked Mrs. Morris. \\\"We can't give him\\nmuch money, but we might let him have one or two of our pets. There's Billy,\\nhe's a bright, little dog, and not two years old yet. He could teach him\\nanything.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a blank silence among the Morris children. Billy was such a gentle,\\nlovable, little dog, that he was a favorite with every one in the house. \\\"I\\nsuppose we ought to do it,\\\" said Miss Laura, at last; \\\"but how can we give him\\nup?\\\"\\n\\nThere was a good deal of discussion, but the end of it was that Billy was given\\nto the Italian. He came up to get him, and was very grateful, and made a great\\nmany bows, holding his hat in his hand. Billy took to him at once, and the\\nItalian spoke so kindly to him, that we knew he would have a good master. Mr.\\nMorris got quite a large sum of money for him, and when he handed it to him, the\\npoor man was so pleased that he kissed his hand, and promised to send frequent\\nword as to Billy's progress and welfare.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVI  DANDY THE TRAMP\\n\\nABOUT a week after Billy left us, the Morris family, much to its surprise,\\nbecame the owner of a new dog.\\n\\nHe walked into the house one cold, wintry afternoon and lay calmly down by the\\nfire. He was a brindled bull-terrier, and he had on a silver-plated collar with\\n\\\"Dandy\\\" engraved on it. He lay all the evening by the fire, and when any of the\\nfamily spoke to him, he wagged his tail, and looked pleased. I growled a little\\nat him at first, but he never cared a bit, and just dozed off to sleep, so I\\nsoon stopped.\\n\\nHe was such a well-bred dog, that the Morrises were afraid that some one had\\nlost him. They made some inquiries the next day, and found that he belonged to a\\nNew York gentleman who had come to Fairport in the summer in a yacht. This dog\\ndid not like the yacht. He came ashore in a boat whenever he got a chance, and\\nif he could not come in a boat, he would swim. He was a tramp, his master said,\\nand he wouldn't stay long in any place. The Morrises were so amused with his\\nimpudence, that they did not send him away, but said every day, \\\"Surely he will\\nbe gone to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nHowever, Mr. Dandy had gotten into comfortable quarters, and he had no intention\\nof changing them, for a while at least. Then he was very handsome, and had such\\na pleasant way with him, that the family could not help liking him. I never\\ncared for him. He fawned on the Morrises, and pretended he loved them, and\\nafterward turned around and laughed and sneered at them in a way that made me\\nvery angry. I used to lecture him sometimes, and growl about him to Jim, but Jim\\nalways said, \\\"Let him alone. You can't do him any good. He was born bad. His\\nmother wasn't good. He tells me that she had a bad name among all the dogs in\\nher neighborhood. She was a thief and a runaway.\\\" Though he provoked me so\\noften, yet I could not help laughing at some of his stories, they were so funny.\\n\\nWe were lying out in the sun, on the platform at the back of the house, one day,\\nand he had been more than usually provoking, so I got up to leave him. He put\\nhimself in my way, however, and said, coaxingly, \\\"Don't be cross, old fellow.\\nI'll tell you some stories to amuse you, old boy. What shall they be about?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think the story of your life would be about as interesting as anything you\\ncould make up,\\\" I said, dryly.\\n\\n\\\"All right, fact or fiction, whichever you like. Here's a fact, plain and\\nunvarnished. Born and bred in New York. Swell stable. Swell coachman. Swell\\nmaster. Jewelled fingers of ladies poking at me, first thing I remember. First\\npainful experience being sent to vet. to have ears cut.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's a vet.?\\\" I said.\\n\\n\\\"A veterinary animal doctor. Vet. didn't cut ears enough. Master sent me back.\\nCut ears again. Summer time, and flies bad. Ears got sore and festered, flies\\nvery attentive. Coachman set little boy to brush flies off, but he'd run out in\\nyard and leave me. Flies awful. Thought they'd eat me up, or else I'd shake out\\nbrains trying to get rid of them. Mother should have stayed home and licked my\\nears, but was cruising about neighborhood. Finally coachman put me in dark\\nplace; powdered ears, and they got well.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why didn't they cut your tail, too?\\\" I said, looking at his long, slim tail,\\nwhich was like a sewer rat's.\\n\\n\\\"'Twasn't the fashion, Mr. Wayback; a bull-terrier's ears are clipped to keep\\nthem from getting torn while fighting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're not a fighting dog,\\\" I said.\\n\\n\\\"Not I. Too much trouble. I believe in taking things easy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think you did,\\\" I said, scornfully. \\\"You never put yourself out for\\nany one, I notice; but, speaking of cropping ears, what do you think of it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" he said, with a sly glance at my head, \\\"it isn't a pleasant operation;\\nbut one might well be out of the world as out of the fashion. I don't care, now\\nmy ears are done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" I said, \\\"think of the poor dogs that will come after you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What difference does that make to me?\\\" he said. \\\"I'll be dead and out of the\\nway. Men can cut off their ears, and tails, and legs, too, if they want to.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dandy,\\\" I said, angrily, \\\"you're the most selfish dog that I ever saw.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't excite yourself,\\\" he said, coolly. \\\"Let me get on with my story. When I\\nwas a few months old, I began to find the stable yard narrow and wondered what\\nthere was outside of it. I discovered a hole in the garden wall, and used to\\nsneak out nights. Oh, what fun it was. I got to know a lot of street dogs, and\\nwe had gay times, barking under people's windows and making them mad, and\\ngetting into back yards and chasing cats. We used to kill a cat nearly every\\nnight. Policeman would chase us, and we would run and run till the water just\\nran off our tongues, and we hadn't a bit of breath left. Then I'd go home and\\nsleep all day, and go out again the next night. When I was about a year old, I\\nbegan to stay out days as well as nights. They couldn't keep me home. Then I ran\\naway for three months. I got with an old lady on Fifth Avenue, who was very fond  of dogs. She had four white poodles, and her servants used to wash them, and tie  up their hair with blue ribbons, and she used to take them for drives in her  phaeton in the park, and they wore gold and silver collars. The biggest poodle  wore a ruby in his collar worth five hundred dollars. I went driving, too, and  sometimes we met my master. He often smiled, and shook his head at me. I heard  him tell the coachman one day that I was a little blackguard, and he was to let  me come and go as I liked.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If they had whipped you soundly,\\\" I said, \\\"it might have made a good dog of  you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm good enough now,\\\" said Dandy, airily. \\\"The young ladies who drove with my  master used to say that it was priggish and tiresome to be too good. To go on  with my story: I stayed with Mrs. Judge Tibbett till I got sick of her fussy  ways She made a simpleton of herself over those poodles. Each one had a high  chair at the table, and a plate, and they always sat in these chairs and had  meals with her, and the servants all called them Master Bijou, and Master Tot,  and Miss Tiny, and Miss Fluff. One day they tried to make me sit in a chair, and  I got cross and bit Mrs. Tibbett, and she beat me cruelly, and her servants  stoned me away from the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Speaking about fools, Dandy,\\\" I said, \\\"if it is polite to call a lady one, I  should say that that lady was one. Dogs shouldn't be put out of their place. Why  didn't she have some poor children at her table, and in her carriage, and let  the dogs run behind?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Easy to see you don't know New York,\\\" said Dandy, with a laugh. \\\"Poor children  don't live with rich, old ladies. Mrs. Tibbett hated children, anyway. Then dogs  like poodles would get lost in the mud, or killed in the crowd if they ran  behind a carriage. Only knowing dogs like me can make their way about.\\\" I rather  doubted this speech; but I said nothing, and he went on patronizingly: \\\"However,  Joe, thou hast reason, as the French say. Mrs. Judge Tibbett didn't give her  dogs exercise enough. Their claws were as long as Chinamen's nails, and the hair  grew over their pads, and they had red eyes and were always sick, and she had to  dose them with medicine, and call them her poor, little, 'weeny-teeny sicky- wicky doggies.' Bah! I got disgusted with her. When I left her, I ran away to  her niece's, Miss Ball's. She was a sensible young lady, and she used to scold  her aunt for the way in which she brought up her dogs. She was almost too  sensible, for her pug and I were rubbed and scrubbed within an inch of our  lives, and had to go for such long walks that I got thoroughly sick of them. A  woman, whom the servants called Trotsey, came every morning, and took the pug  and me by our chains, and sometimes another dog or two, and took us for long  tramps in quiet streets. That was Trotsey's business, to walk dogs, and Miss  Ball got a great many fashionable young ladies who could not exercise their  dogs, to let Trotsey have them, and they said that it made a great difference in  the health and appearance of their pets. Trotsey got fifteen cents an hour for a  dog. Goodness, what appetites those walks gave us, and didn't we make the dog  biscuits disappear? But it was a slow life at Miss Ball's. We only saw her for a  little while every day. She slept till noon. After lunch she played with us for  a little while in the greenhouse, then she was off driving or visiting, and in  the evening she always had company, or went to a dance, or to the theatre. I  soon made up my mind that I'd run away. I jumped out of a window one fine  morning, and ran home. I stayed there for a long time. My mother had been run  over by a cart and killed, and I wasn't sorry. My master never bothered his head  about me, and I could do as I liked. One day when I was having a walk, and  meeting a lot of dogs that I knew, a little boy came behind me, and before I  could tell what he was doing, he had snatched me up, and was running off with  me. I couldn't bite him, for he had stuffed some of his rags in my mouth. He  took me to a tenement house, in a part of the city that I had never been in  before. He belonged to a very poor family. My faith, weren't they badly off six  children, and a mother, and father, all living in two tiny rooms. Scarcely a bit  of meat did I smell while I was there. I hated their bread and molasses, and the  place smelled so badly that I thought I should choke.\\n\\n\\\"They kept me shut up in their dirty rooms for several days; and the brat of a  boy that caught me slept with his arm around me at night. The weather was hot  and sometimes we couldn't sleep, and they had to go up on the roof. After a  while, they chained me up in a filthy yard at the back of the house, and there I  thought I should go mad. I would have liked to bite them all to death, if I had  dared. It's awful to be chained, especially for a dog like me that loves his  freedom. The flies worried me, and the noises distracted me, and my flesh would  fairly creep from getting no exercise. I was there nearly a month, while they  were waiting for a reward to be offered. But none came; and one day, the boy's  father, who was a street peddler, took me by my chain and led me about the  streets till he sold me. A gentleman got me for his little boy, but I didn't  like the look of him, so I sprang up and bit his hand, and he dropped the chain,  and I dodged boys and policemen and finally got home more dead than alive, and  looking like a skeleton. I had a good time for several weeks, and then I began  to get restless and was off again. But I'm getting tired; I want to go to  sleep.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're not very polite,\\\" I said, \\\"to offer to tell a story, and then go to  sleep before you finish it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Look out for number one, my boy,\\\" said Dandy, with a yawn; \\\"for if you don't,  no one else will,\\\" and he shut his eyes and was fast asleep in a few minutes.\\n\\nI sat and looked at him. What a handsome, good-natured, worthless dog he was. A  few days later, he told me the rest of his history. After a great many  wanderings, he happened home one day just as his master's yacht was going to  sail, and they chained him up till they went on board, so that he could be an  amusement on the passage to Fairport.\\n\\nIt was in November that Dandy came to us, and he stayed all winter. He made fun  of the Morrises all the time, and said they had a dull, poky, old house, and he  only stayed because Miss Laura was nursing him. He had a little sore on his back  that she soon found out was mange. Her father said it was a bad disease for dogs  to have, and Dandy had better be shot; but she begged so hard for his life, and  said she would cure him in a few weeks that she was allowed to keep him. Dandy  wasn't capable of getting really angry, but he was as disturbed about having  this disease as he could be about anything. He said that he had got it from a  little, mangy dog, that he had played with a few weeks before. He was only with  the dog a little while, and didn't think he would take it, but it seemed he knew  what an easy thing it was to get.\\n\\nUntil he got well he was separated from us. Miss Laura kept him up in the loft  with the rabbits, where we could not go; and the boys ran him around the garden  for exercise. She tried all kinds of cures for him, and I heard her say that  although it was a skin disease, his blood must be purified. She gave him some of  the pills that she made out of sulphur and butter for Jim, and Billy, and me, to  keep our coats silky and smooth. When they didn't cure him, she gave him a few  drops of arsenic every day, and washed the sore, and, indeed his whole body,  with tobacco water or carbolic soap. It was the tobacco water that cured him.\\n\\nMiss Laura always put on gloves when she went near him, and used a brush to wash  him, for if a person takes mange from a dog, they may lose their hair and their  eyelashes. But if they are careful, no harm comes from nursing a mangy dog, and  I have never known of any one taking the disease.\\n\\nAfter a time, Dandy's sore healed, and he was set free. He was right glad, he  said, for he had got heartily sick of the rabbits. He used to bark at them and  make them angry, and they would run around the loft, stamping their hind feet at  him, in the funny way that rabbits do. I think they disliked him as much as he  disliked them. Jim and I did not get the mange. Dandy was not a strong dog, and  I think his irregular way of living made him take diseases readily. He would  stuff himself when he was hungry, and he always wanted rich food. If he couldn't  get what he wanted at the Morrises', he went out and stole, or visited the dumps  at the back of the town.\\n\\nWhen he did get ill, he was more stupid about doctoring himself than any dog  that I have ever seen. He never seemed to know when to eat grass or herbs, or a  little earth, that would have kept him in good condition. A dog should never be  without grass. When Dandy got ill he just suffered till he got well again, and  never tried to cure himself of his small troubles. Some dogs even know enough to  amputate their limbs. Jim told me a very interesting story of a dog the Morrises  once had, called Gyp, whose leg became paralyzed by a kick from a horse. He knew  the leg was dead, and gnawed it off nearly to the shoulder, and though he was  very sick for a time, yet in the end he got well.\\n\\nTo return to Dandy. I knew he was only waiting for the spring to leave us, and I  was not sorry. The first fine day he was off, and during the rest of the spring  and summer we occasionally met him running about the town with a set of fast  dogs. One day I stopped and asked him how he concealed himself in such a quiet  place as Fairport, and he said he was dying to get back to New York, and was  hoping that his master's yacht would come and take him away.\\n\\nPoor Dandy never left Fairport. After all, he was not such a bad dog. There was  nothing really vicious about him, and I hate to speak of his end. His master's  yacht did not come, and soon the summer was over, and the winter was coming, and  no one wanted Dandy, for he had such a bad name. He got hungry and cold, and one  day sprang upon a little girl, to take away a piece of bread and butter that she  was eating. He did not see the large house-dog on the door sill, and before he  could get away, the dog had seized him, and bitten and shaken him till he was  nearly dead. When the dog threw him aside, he crawled to the Morrises, and Miss  Laura bandaged his wounds, and made him a bed in the stable.\\n\\nOne Sunday morning she washed and fed him very tenderly, for she knew he could  not live much longer. He was so weak that he could scarcely eat the food that  she put in his mouth, so she let him lick some milk from her finger. As she was  going to church, I could not go with her, but I ran down the lane and watched  her out of sight. When I came back, Dandy was gone. I looked till I found him.  He had crawled into the darkest corner of the stable to die, and though he was  suffering very much, he never uttered a sound. I sat by him and thought of his  master in New York. If he had brought Dandy up properly he might not now be here  in his silent death agony. A young pup should be trained just as a child is, and  punished when he goes wrong. Dandy began badly, and not being checked in his  evil ways, had come so this. Poor Dandy! Poor, handsome dog of a rich master! He  opened his dull eyes, gave me one last glance, then, with a convulsive shudder,  his torn limbs were still. He would never suffer any more.\\n\\nWhen Miss Laura came home, she cried bitterly to know that he was dead. The boys  took him away from her, and made him a grave in the corner of the garden.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXXVII  THE END OF MY STORY\\n\\nI HAVE come now to the last chapter of my story. I thought when I began to  write, that I would put down the events of each year of my life, but I fear that  would make my story too long, and neither Miss Laura nor any boys and girls  would care to read it. So I will stop just here, though I would gladly go on,  for I have enjoyed so much talking over old times, that I am very sorry to leave  off.\\n\\nEvery year that I have been at the Morrises', something pleasant has happened to  me, but I cannot put all these things down, nor can I tell how Miss Laura and  the boys grew and changed, year by year, till now they are quite grown up. I  will just bring my tale down to the present time, and then I will stop talking,  and go lie down in my basket, for I am an old dog now, and get tired very  easily.\\n\\nI was a year old when I went to the Morrises, and I have been with them for  twelve years. I am not living in the same house with Mr. and Mrs. Morris now,  but I am with my dear Miss Laura, who is Miss Laura no longer, but Mrs. Gray.  She married Mr. Harry four years ago, and lives with him and Mr. and Mrs. Wood,  on Dingley Farm. Mr. and Mrs. Morris live in a cottage near by. Mr. Morris is  not very strong, and can preach no longer. The boys are all scattered. Jack  married pretty Miss Bessie Drury, and lives on a large farm near here. Miss  Bessie says that she hates to be a farmer's wife, but she always looks very  happy and contented, so I think that she must be mistaken. Carl is a merchant in  New York, Ned is a clerk in a bank, and Willie is studying at a place called  Harvard. He says that after he finishes his studies, he is going to live with  his father and mother.\\n\\nThe Morrises' old friends often come to see them. Mrs. Drury comes every summer  on her way to Newport, and Mr. Montague and Charlie come every other summer.  Charlie always brings with him his old dog Brisk, who is getting feeble, like  myself. We lie on the veranda in the sunshine, and listen to the Morrises  talking about old days, and sometimes it makes us feel quite young again. In  addition to Brisk we have a Scotch collie. He is very handsome, and is a  constant attendant of Miss Laura's. We are great friends, he and I, but he can  get about much better than I can. One day a friend of Miss Laura's came with a  little boy and girl, and \\\"Collie\\\" sat between the two children, and their father  took their picture with a \\\"kodak.\\\" I like him so much that I told him I would  get them to put his picture in my book.\\n\\nWhen the Morris boys are all here in the summer we have gay times. All through  the winter we look forward to their coming, for they make the old farmhouse so  lively. Mr. Maxwell never misses a summer in coming to Riverdale. He has such a  following of dumb animals now, that he says he can't move them any farther away  from Boston than this, and he doesn't know what he will do with them, unless he  sets up a menagerie. He asked Miss Laura the other day, if she thought that the  old Italian would take him into partnership. He did not know what had happened  to poor Bellini, so Miss Laura told him.\\n\\nA few years ago the Italian came to Riverdale, to exhibit his new stock of  performing animals. They were almost as good as the old ones, but he had not  quite so many as he had before. The Morrises and a great many of their friends  went to his performance, and Miss Laura said afterward, that when cunning little  Billy came on the stage, and made his bow, and went through his antics of  jumping through hoops, and catching balls, that she almost had hysterics. The  Italian had made a special pet of him for the Morrises' sake, and treated him  more like a human being than a dog. Billy rather put on airs when he came up to  the farm to see us, but he was such a dear, little dog, in spite of being almost  spoiled by his master, that Jim and I could not get angry with him. In a few  days they went away, and we heard nothing but good news from them, till last  winter. Then a letter came to Miss Laura from a nurse in a New York hospital.  She said that the Italian was very near his end, and he wanted her to write to  Mrs. Gray to tell her that he had sold all his animals but the little dog that  she had so kindly given him. He was sending him back to her, and with his latest  breath he would pray for heaven's blessing on the kind lady and her family that  had befriended him when he was in trouble.\",\"timestamp\":1640141258,\"title\":\"\\nThe Fairport hotel was built right in the centre of the town, and the shops and \\nhouses crowded quite close about it.\"},\"digest\":\"idrCGB_2rKy4g_SqyB97KgDtKY0G3AoT0XSE01kbfpU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3F55F7d8879A09131180614410f6Ba3Af0a49E6d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3pwTJiboOgAp1pCbJ9ajV4l8Y7Fp01uaL5e-GmoJA80\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ghM9eVOsy4wXvGlrDwRPfcgg3IHFjx48nnEFftC834o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EoccyCJRV_KZosS2TuB4euA32JWk2IMdO5QkwXMEYPG9Y7s3pxBnwoyK8G-hQBovhRAGmHSz1HpQThxpIneVWA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x92e2338c822dc2e2635c5f77feb03b7577b956de12c5b90323fb5d09d64b9c08634644e18efbaabe2cfd935183cf8bea60d43207be28d2f6b5d9d533a54453d61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3pwTJiboOgAp1pCbJ9ajV4l8Y7Fp01uaL5e-GmoJA80\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ghM9eVOsy4wXvGlrDwRPfcgg3IHFjx48nnEFftC834o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"idrCGB_2rKy4g_SqyB97KgDtKY0G3AoT0XSE01kbfpU\"}"
