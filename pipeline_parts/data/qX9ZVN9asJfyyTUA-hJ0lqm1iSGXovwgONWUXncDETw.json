"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The market depth for [bitcoin (BTC)](https://cryptonews.com/coins/bitcoin/) and [ethereum (ETH)](https://cryptonews.com/coins/ethereum/) on the three exchanges **[Coinbase](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/coinbase/en)**, **[Kraken](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/kraken/en)**, and **[Gemini](https://rapi.cryptonews.com/ext/gemini/en)** has improved since the beginning of 2020, indicating that the two major cryptoassets are becoming mature, according to crypto analytics provider **Coin Metrics**. \\n\\nThe finding that the market for both BTC and ETH is maturing was described as important by the analysts, given that it gives large financial institutions with more sophisticated trading and execution strategies a chance to trade the assets with minimal slippage costs.\\n\\n“Significant liquidity across many exchanges means that one particular market order will have less of an impact on the prevailing market price,” a report from Coin Metrics said. It added that more liquidity also improves the price discovery process, which in turn makes market manipulation “more expensive and unlikely.”\\n\\nLooking at bitcoin specifically, Coin Metrics said that market depth “has generally been improving” on the three exchanges examined. It added that the quality of the market depth has also improved, using as an example that the top 100 bids and asks on Coinbase “have all been within 0.2% of the best bid/ask.”\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hVlQ_UXeLO8gRLlOAf1Pd.jpg?height=818&width=1225)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638354362,\"title\":\"Bitcoin and Ethereum See Deeper Markets, Maturing as Assets\"},\"digest\":\"qwvr2J3p0wgc50yhfD3bZkq179aXAdYTLz_JEfcr3O8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7E857F769D1001444CC634F88f3B0004060313cb\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"z3RClSR7MA2NjuB3-GdDSw-ix_Y3P8vN5iyMS1LZzac\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u6QqVZnyejWuh7ni6nX_q8XqsIKzHBMR2doQjyfdiro\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zu5Sb9O37yWsSBO3HTBLUw2ZwupliAv3yyG0JAg3RgBj78RbOMQNMRLoIYrOyFr3HkLoYVJBeL-83mPGHWw7Cw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x14a1e422c85578aab7a9191443a49ebc0b797fe7ea37b9d002784ef46dbb679853898e79df7534228ea7e43e0c6a3504e0fb3a400d5f5aa62c6f36f6fddc53941b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"z3RClSR7MA2NjuB3-GdDSw-ix_Y3P8vN5iyMS1LZzac\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"u6QqVZnyejWuh7ni6nX_q8XqsIKzHBMR2doQjyfdiro\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qwvr2J3p0wgc50yhfD3bZkq179aXAdYTLz_JEfcr3O8\"}"
