Go through the complete article to make a wise decision.\\n\\n# Renewable energy and Blockchain Technology are future\\n\\nThe current energy production and consumption process are not good for the environment, the earth, and the future. Renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, hydro, and geothermal are superior in many ways.\\n\\nThese energy sources do not cause various types of pollution, they also do not incur fuel costs or require transportation, and therefore offer greater price stability. In fact, some electric utilities include it in their retail electricity prices, exemption from certain charges for customers purchasing renewable energy.\\n\\nThus, Renewable energy is the perfect solution, similarly, blockchain has the same reputation. It is so advanced that people who are against crypto adoption are also in favor of blockchain adaptation.\\n\\nBlockchain technology can solve some of the major problems that are currently making energy buying and selling complicated, it can actually revolutionize the current system and process.\\n\\n# Not Just the energy sector\\n\\nThe focus of the project is not limited to the energy sector. ESG based businesses across all the sectors will be covered under the roof of RichMint. Token will be also accepted between all these sectors and all the products and services of RichMint.\\n\\nSome of the major sectors including health care, pharma, agriculture commodities, EV charging, etc, will also get the benefit from the revolution RichMint is trying to bring. As it can be clearly seen, the project covers a wide area and user base which will not only bring businesses from all these sectors together but will also attract more users, buyers, investors, and trading activities.\\n\\n# Latest Crypto Technologies\\n\\nNFT which stands for Non-fungible token is in trend right now. It is attracting more and more users and breaking many records in the crypto-verse. Similarly, the dual token ecosystem is a method that is making all the buzz but very few of the companies are brave enough to try it.\\n\\nRichMint is adopting NFTs and dual token mechanisms into the account. Both the technologies will be used to streamline the process to the most advanced level.\\n\\nSince the company is mentioning itself as a decentralized autonomous organization thus power will be in members’ hands. There will be no central authority, thus people will take decisions and everything will be transparent to everyone.\\n\\n# Unmatched Benefits to the Investors\\n\\nThere won’t be many projects that will have this kind of futuristic approach and more benefits that RichMint offers. With limited supply, investors will always be in profit, because with time the price will definitely rise.\\n\\nWith such a dedicated ecosystem investors will be always happy to give support by investing in it. Since this project is covering a very wide user base, more and more people will participate in this revolution and then all the benefits will be multiplied very quickly.\\n\\nThese are the major reasons investors should invest in RichMint. However, there are many things to know and explore in this project, So take a look at the website and go through the whitepaper to know everything in detail. There are more reasons that will encourage you to invest in it.[\\n](https://medium.com/@richmint?source=post_sidebar--------------------------post_sidebar--------------)\",\"timestamp\":1641977187,\"title\":\"Why Should You Invest in RichMint?\\n\"},\"digest\":\"gedg2nw4ZYtsExuICtEB2EOhMUtnFIv1tyzQrC41YWY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x929b44b35C7a8f0803da913743C2ee339427C6eD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NasSy63_1Dlv1z5jzqWOMqib7HLP9ZIGm8SsTkdtQFg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oQP0cl5rSeypPGsmtoTs9m96K8yZwsyeq32hmJNqXRU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9F_7lCiURkJw_3WkQ8M-5Zr3TvAqCU4YlxcnJp7hXif1adBZLldCtzQ3IcsXnj4uO8KDu5gw_Rt-6M4qwu_P4w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd50f344d6f54dc73a78bfd845aebb26f5c9b0f485d4d6e49088213b08b37276c0e389fbbeeccabd21c4ba370f1bc67fc665b884d15c261fa5daaff6d03b041451b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NasSy63_1Dlv1z5jzqWOMqib7HLP9ZIGm8SsTkdtQFg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"oQP0cl5rSeypPGsmtoTs9m96K8yZwsyeq32hmJNqXRU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NO8dSoB-uxXyB7lMtf0s3mkPgIWLrFN7bhmmVPYlQe0\"}"
