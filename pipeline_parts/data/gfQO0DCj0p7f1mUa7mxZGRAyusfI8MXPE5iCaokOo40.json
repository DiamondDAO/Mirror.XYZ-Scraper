"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"PhilosopherDAO wants to explore the new ethics of participation with the goal of funding philosophy outside of academia.\\n\\n# Manifesto\\n\\nüëÅ‚Äçüó® We believe a philosophical approach can open up new social, political, and environmental perspectives.\\n\\nüî≠ We believe philosophers can explore the intersection of ancient wisdom and internet culture.\\n\\nüó≥ We want to explore new ethics of participation.\\n\\n‚ö™Ô∏è We want to explore the philosophy of decentralized virtual worlds.\\n\\nüîÆ And do what philosophers do best: Contemplate about where we should or shouldn't go.\\n\\n### Philosophers are pioneers\\n\\nPhilosophers were the first mathematicians, astronomers, and scientists. They've been responsible for many discoveries. They attempted to reason about ethics and about how a society should be governed. In ancient Greece, they pioneered direct democracy.\\n\\n### Philosophy should not only be for academics\\n\\nAcademia funds philosophy for academics. Philosophical texts shouldn't be bloated and hard to read. They should be practical and accessible. Accessible not only in the sense that they should be free but also in how easy they can be understood.\\n\\n### Philosophers need to go back to doing\\n\\nPhilosophers used to be tinkerers. They used to participate in forums and sometimes even governed nations. Nowadays, they're left writing obscure texts and have lost touch with practical matters.\\n\\nPhilosopherDAO will:\\n\\n* help fund research outside of academia\\n* put philosophers back in the middle of the forum, making decisions, and exploring the ethics of participation\\n* onboard the next generation of philosophers onto the world of blockchain\\n\\n## Want to contribute\\n\\n* as a philosopher\\n* w/ memes\\n* as a developer\\n* help fund the project\\n* or keep up to date with the  PhilosopherDAO newsletter?\\n\\nYou can fill out a form here:\\n\\n[https://notionforms.io/forms/form-phildao](https://notionforms.io/forms/form-phildao)\\n\\n### Follow us on\\n\\ntwitter.com/PhilosopherDAO\",\"timestamp\":1636126416,\"title\":\"PhilosopherDAO\"},\"digest\":\"fe7P3pQvK9-zuqROatWQpBxHqQgZ7uskjlsYD8Ofh9I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x09cc4B3a27E3715596c5eDE07E95Da490340D27a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uivnl11rS5upYFN5zQ2x_qvCw03mJfFOwYSSD8eFTWA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SMnfUEYZOMhNoW7p1S9-VS0N3XH7GQ1Exnk68CLjyyc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HjZo8B1C1ss4nongCGPRvMRLJCX4F53pHHo8jxLxNBynkG1pqp-4o3PTRWzgae9Ai1f9hI0Ay352b68ZNb0nXQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5c8f82301cb3dc25d874bf6baf4d750b8118677bfbed5dadb84ccd6bf852f05415dcaeebc7d9b75a31f3420fee8b3995e7554ea9d06cd134214ada9e1e208ed31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uivnl11rS5upYFN5zQ2x_qvCw03mJfFOwYSSD8eFTWA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SMnfUEYZOMhNoW7p1S9-VS0N3XH7GQ1Exnk68CLjyyc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DOVXo1yL6lAkV4qVu-6snLju6k7OTlSN08ujyJ72Kcc\"}"
