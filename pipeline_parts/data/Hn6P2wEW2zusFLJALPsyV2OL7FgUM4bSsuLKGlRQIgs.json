"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I dread to come to the end of the year,said a friend to me recently, ”it makes me realize I am growing old.“ \\n 　　 \\n 　　William James, the great psychologist, said that most men are ”old fogies at twenty-fiveHe was right. Most men at twenty-five are satisfied with their jobs. They have accumulated the little stock of prejudices that they call their “Principles, ” and closed their minds to all new ideas; they have ceased to grow. \\n 　　 \\n 　　The minutea man ceases to grow-no matter what his years-that minute he begins to be old. On the other hand, the really great man never grows old. \\n 　　 \\n 　　Goethe passed out at eighty-three, and finished his Faust only a few years earlier; Gladstone took up a new language when he was seventy. Laplace, the astronomer, was still at work when death caught up with him at seventy-eight. He died crying, “What we know is nothing; what we do not know is immense.” \\n 　　 \\n 　　And there you have the real answer to the question, “When is a man old?” \\n 　　 \\n 　　Laplace at seventy-eight died young. He was still unsatisfied, still sure that he had a lot to learn. \\n 　　 \\n 　　As long as a man can keep himself in that attitude of mind, as long as he can look back on every year and say , “I grew,” he is still young. \\n 　　 \\n 　　The minute he ceases to grow, the minute he says to himself, “I know all that I need to know,”--that day youth stops. He may be twenty-five or seventy-five, it makes no difference. On that day he begins to be old.\",\"timestamp\":1634967243,\"title\":\"become old\"},\"digest\":\"rhoKJY-ysioNbiTpa5ZD6VYTYZuBJ_9c1B6WDTYya1c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7C7b69DfE8554F2e1b44B7dAd9424347BF6e6316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iT50sVjckymiA_YeIZMPq4RrcNthjRniQBut6pyUOkY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g5ZSfkUm4ZNo3eMhYVrYYhI4ZpXSCv7rpq-PdNP0QNg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"lTx3srax984vXrs2Mi_GQXMOUsMAgU3LyzgCI-Q1MI7_yjjzd-eTo4hsMiGa2LWe8ETHe0qr6ewS8tbuE5rIiA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe929da7a8b26286ec388036e936dc6bfda28885b84cb54bb24e5786aa854b07248b3978b7f1914980b02837e98cab61decff8c2bdc5fc00fb44f5b71d91310fd1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iT50sVjckymiA_YeIZMPq4RrcNthjRniQBut6pyUOkY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g5ZSfkUm4ZNo3eMhYVrYYhI4ZpXSCv7rpq-PdNP0QNg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rhoKJY-ysioNbiTpa5ZD6VYTYZuBJ_9c1B6WDTYya1c\"}"
