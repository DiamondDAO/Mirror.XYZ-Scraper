The buzz around this phrase may have peaked on Thursday when Facebook announced that it was rebranding its portfolio of firms ‘Meta’ to match its businesses with its goal of building the metaverse.\\n\\nThe metaverse is a hot topic right now. Why? And what exactly does the term “metaverse” imply? Currently, there isn’t anything that could be considered a true metaverse. The term presently lacks a precise definition, but that’s fine: the metaverse is a process of being, not simply existing. When I need to explain it quickly, the metaverse is a point in time when we value our digital lives more than our physical lives.\\n\\nAlthough the metaverse is not yet a reality, it may be the next step in the internet’s growth. The concept is that “extended reality” — a blend of augmented, virtual, and mixed reality — will become a popular social and economic interaction mode.\\n\\n**Is the metaverse a term that has outlived its usefulness?**\\n\\nIn recent inventions, humans have devised several devices to deceive our senses and movement, ranging from TVs and Audio speakers to interactive virtual reality and video games. We may develop instruments to deceive our other purposes, such as touch, in the future. There are several titles for these technologies, but none encapsulates the whole mash-up of traditional reality (the actual world) and our constructed extensions to existence (the virtual world).\\n\\nMoreover, the traditional titles fail to convey the novel social ties, sensory experiences, and economic behaviors arising from these virtual expansions. Upland, for example, combines non-fungible tokens (NFTs) with property markets to create a virtual replica of our reality. For the same, the metaverse and the real-world economy are in a very close relationship. Let’s find out it in the next part.\\n\\n**In the metaverse, you are connecting digital assets to real-world economic activities.**\\n\\nThe metaverse is anticipated to have a close relationship with the real-world economy, ultimately becoming its extension. To put it another way, the metaverse must allow businesses and people to engage in economic activity in the same manner they do now. Said, this entails the ability to create and invest in commodities and products.\\n\\nThis may depend on non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as the basis for value generation to some degree. A non-transferable token (NFT) is a claim of ownership for a single, non-transferable digital asset maintained on a blockchain. Suppose NFTs become a widely used method for trading such products. In that case, they may speed up the adoption of XR ecosystems as locations where individuals can merge aspects of the digital economy with their offline lives. Considering all these, even though the metaverse is in its initial stage, it can be the next big thing.\\n\\n**The Metaverse as the Next Big Thing in Computing**\\n\\nThe internet, according to technologists, will ultimately grow into the metaverse, which will become the next central computer platform. If realized, the notion can potentially alter society and industry the same way that the mobile phone did. Millions of people use the internet today to access information and services, interact and socialize with one another, sell items, and enjoy themselves. This value proposition is expected to be replicated in the metaverse. The primary difference is that the boundary between being offline and online will be considerably more challenging to discern. Let’s discuss the perk and loss of the metaverse.\\n\\n**The metaverse’s characteristics and problems**\\n\\nThough this explains the metaverse’s origins, it is impossible to foretell how it will manifest. Indeed, the metaverse is still in its early phases of development; we cannot predict its future. Of course, several questions are popping about what the metaverse will mean for privacy, whether it will be inclusive or highly exclusive, and how to keep potentially harmful content and settings to a minimum. Because the metaverse is still in its early stages of development, there is still time to design these qualities. Many of the world’s foremost technological corporations invest in creating the metaverse because it seems to be a promising concept. It is possible that if it is successful, it will change consumer and business behavior. Now, the question pops that who benefits from the metaverse?\\n\\n**Who stands to gain from the metaverse?**\\n\\nIf you read too much about huge tech corporations like Facebook, Microsoft, and Google, you can come to believe that technological advancements (such as the advent of the metaverse) are unavoidable. It’s difficult not to wonder how these new technologies will impact our society, culture in the future, and politics and how we could fit into that picture. This concept is known as “technological determinism,” which holds that technological advancements alter our social ties, power relations, and culture, with humans as simple passengers. It ignores the reality that, in a democratic society, we have a voice in how everything unfolds.\\n\\nThe metaverse is attractive for Facebook and other huge firms eager to embrace the “next big thing” before their rivals because it opens up new markets, new types of social networks, new consumer gadgets, and new patents. What isn’t clear is why you or I would find it all fascinating.\\n\\nBy putting even more of our lives on a global platform, the concept of a metaverse takes this dilemma to a new level. It provides us with an infinite number of ways to circumvent the physical world's limits, but it only does so by imposing constraints imposed by what the metaverse will allow.\",\"timestamp\":1639932734,\"title\":\"Stepping into Metaverse!! - Swapnasagar Pradhan - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"jNSWV9oQ9jrSjfYxQxcp8hpwfDuCbAd_WYc5I9Ctbw0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x471b96e7e6c5E1B350D233bF5297A2a3C29Fd852\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ebTAEQ1hyTmRR-6Hp78w5gUaYOGpXlc3V5oEU3sZKv4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fypsLqsFe0E_-EMRI03cg3Byli4sZcimcVGSIaEn-os\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_CVpYusTxxqNGiXBK0niZ_yVy7QpI7AHMwxgZVmxrKkOuCGRGawQJF0KyWVQSsdwoveuM5BtXnMA5ASTartTrQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa94edcf31c6e467b90b8c6a6414d3e2c6738e1d00e7f5140604a79bd93b94efa14eb955288ad4f2959313b6f0e1a13efe04810cd12e1a0753ce35f07b7567d431c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ebTAEQ1hyTmRR-6Hp78w5gUaYOGpXlc3V5oEU3sZKv4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fypsLqsFe0E_-EMRI03cg3Byli4sZcimcVGSIaEn-os\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jNSWV9oQ9jrSjfYxQxcp8hpwfDuCbAd_WYc5I9Ctbw0\"}"
