"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"That's very strange!  No, I haven't seen them.  They can't be here, or we would have known it.  My husband and I - \\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is your name, and your husband's name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mine is Joiwind - my husband's is Panawe.  We live a very long way from here; still, it came to us both last night that you were lying here insensible.  We almost quarrelled about which of us should come to you, but in the end I won.\\\" Here she laughed.  \\\"I won, because I am the stronger - hearted of the two; he is the purer in perception.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thanks, Joiwind!\\\" said Maskull simply.\\n\\nThe colors chased each other rapidly beneath her skin.  \\\"Oh, why do you say that?  What pleasure is greater than loving-kindness? I rejoiced at the opportunity.... But now we must exchange blood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is this?\\\" he demanded, rather puzzled.\\n\\n\\\"It must be so.  Your blood is far too thick and heavy for our world. Until you have an infusion of mine, you will never get up.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull flushed.  \\\"I feel like a complete ignoramus here.... Won't it hurt you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If your blood pains you, I suppose it will pain me.  But we will share the pain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"This is a new kind of hospitality to me,\\\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\\"Wouldn't you do the same for me?\\\" asked Joiwind, half smiling, half agitated.\\n\\n\\\"I can't answer for any of my actions in this world.  I scarcely know where I am.... Why, yes - of course I would, Joiwind.\\\"\\n\\nWhile they were talking it had become full day.  The mists had rolled away from the ground, and only the upper atmosphere remained fog - charged.  The desert of scarlet sand stretched in all directions, except one, where there was a sort of little oasis - some low hills, clothed sparsely with little purple trees from base to summit.  It was about a quarter of a mile distant.\\n\\nJoiwind had brought with her a small flint knife.  Without any trace of nervousness, she made a careful, deep incision on her upper arm. Maskull expostulated.\\n\\n\\\"Really, this part of it is nothing,\\\" she said, laughing.  \\\"And if it were - a sacrifice that is no sacrifice - what merit is there in that? ... Come now - your arm!\\\"\\n\\nThe blood was streaming down her arm.  It was not red blood, but a milky, opalescent fluid.\\n\\n\\\"Not that one!\\\" said Maskull, shrinking.  \\\"I have already been cut there.\\\" He submitted the other, and his blood poured forth.\\n\\nJoiwind delicately and skilfully placed the mouths of the two wounds together, and then kept her arm pressed tightly against Maskull's for a long time.  He felt a stream of pleasure entering his body through the incision.  His old lightness and vigour began to return to him. After about five minutes a duel of kindness started between them; he wanted to remove his arm, and she to continue.  At last he had his way, but it was none too soon - she stood there pale and dispirited.\\n\\nShe looked at him with a more serious expression than before, as if strange depths had opened up before her eyes. \\\"What is your name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Maskull.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where have you come from, with this awful blood?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From a world called Earth.... The blood is clearly unsuitable for this world, Joiwind, but after all, that was only to be expected. I am sorry I let you have your way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't say that!  There was nothing else to be done.  We must all help one another.  Yet, somehow - forgive me - I feel polluted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And well you may, for it's a fearful thing for a girl to accept in her own veins the blood of a strange man from a strange planet.  If I had not been so dazed and weak I would never have allowed it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I would have insisted.  Are we not all brothers and sisters? Why did you come here, Maskull?\\\"\\n\\nHe was conscious of a slight degree of embarrassment.  \\\"Will you think it foolish if I say I hardly know? - I came with those two men. Perhaps I was attracted by curiosity, or perhaps it was the love of adventure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps,\\\" said Joiwind.  \\\"I wonder .. . These friends of yours must be terrible men.  Why did they come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That I can tell you.  They came to follow Surtur.\\\"\\n\\nHer face grew troubled.  \\\"I don't understand it.  One of them at least must be a bad man, and yet if he is following Surtur - or Shaping, as he is called here - he can't be really bad.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you know of Surtur?\\\" asked Maskull in astonishment.\\n\\nJoiwind remained silent for a time, studying his face.  His brain moved restlessly, as though it were being probed from outside.  \\\"I see.... and yet I don't see,\\\" she said at last.  \\\"It is very difficult.... Your God is a dreadful Being - bodyless, unfriendly, invisible.  Here we don't worship a God like that.  Tell me, has any man set eyes on your God?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does all this mean, Joiwind?  Why speak of God?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In ancient times, when the earth was young and grand, a few holy men are reputed to have walked and spoken with God, but those days are past.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Our world is still young,\\\" said Joiwind.  \\\"Shaping goes among us and converses with us.  He is real and active - a friend and lover. Shaping made us, and he loves his work.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you met him?\\\" demanded Maskull, hardly believing his ears.\\n\\n\\\"No.  I have done nothing to deserve it yet.  Some day I may have an opportunity to sacrifice myself, and then I may be rewarded by meeting and talking with Shaping.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have certainly come to another world.  But why do you say he is the same as Surtur?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he is the same.  We women call him Shaping, and so do most men, but a few name him Surtur.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull bit his nail.  \\\"Have you ever heard of Crystalman?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is Shaping once again.  You see, he has many names - which shows how much he occupies our minds.  Crystalman is a name of affection.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's odd,\\\" said Maskull.  \\\"I came here with quite different ideas about Crystalman.\\\"\\n\\nJoiwind shook her hair.  \\\"In that grove of trees over there stands a desert shrine of his.  Let us go and pray there, and then we'll go on our way to Poolingdred.  That is my home.  It's a long way off, and we must get there before Blodsombre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, what is Blodsombre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For about four hours in the middle of the day Branchspell's rays are so hot that no one can endure them.  We call it Blodsombre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is Branchspell another name for Arcturus?\\\"\\n\\nJoiwind threw off her seriousness and laughed.  \\\"Naturally we don't take our names from you, Maskull. I don't think our names are very poetic, but they follow nature.\\\"\\n\\nShe took his arm affectionately, and directed their walk towards the tree - covered hills.  As they went along, the sun broke through the upper mists and a terrible gust of scorching heat, like a blast from a furnace, struck Maskull's head.  He involuntarily looked up, but lowered his eyes again like lightning.  All that he saw in that instant was a glaring ball of electric white, three times the apparent diameter of the sun.  For a few minutes he was quite blind.\\n\\n\\\"My God!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"If it's like this in early morning you must be right enough about Blodsombre.\\\" When he had somewhat recovered himself he asked, \\\"How long are the days here, Joiwind?\\\"\\n\\nAgain he felt his brain being probed.\\n\\n\\\"At this time of the year, for every hour's daylight that you have in summer, we have two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The heat is terrific - and yet somehow I don't feel so distressed by it as I would have expected.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I feel it more than usual.  It's not difficult to account for it; you have some of my blood, and I have some of yours.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, every time I realise that, I - Tell me, Joiwind, will my blood alter, if I stay here long enough? - I mean, will it lose its redness and thickness, and become pure and thin and light - coloured, like yours?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not?  If you live as we live, you will assuredly grow like us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean food and drink?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We eat no food, and drink only water.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And on that you manage to sustain life?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, Maskull, our water is good water,\\\" replied Joiwind, smiling.\\n\\nAs soon as he could see again he stared around at the landscape.  The enormous scarlet desert extended everywhere to the horizon, excepting where it was broken by the oasis.  It was roofed by a cloudless, deep blue, almost violet, sky.  The circle of the horizon was far larger than on earth.  On the skyline, at right angles to the direction in which they were walking, appeared a chain of mountains, apparently about forty miles' distant.  One, which was higher than the rest, was shaped like a cup.  Maskull would have felt inclined to believe he was travelling in dreamland, but for the intensity of the light, which made everything vividly real.\\n\\nJoiwind pointed to the cup - shaped mountain.  \\\"That's Poolingdred.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You didn't come from there!\\\" he exclaimed, quite startled.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I did indeed.  And that is where we have to go to now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"With the single object of finding me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes.\\\"\\n\\nThe colour mounted to his face.  \\\"Then you are the bravest and noblest of all girls,\\\" he said quietly, after a pause.  \\\"Without exception.  Why, this is a journey for an athlete!\\\"\\n\\nShe pressed his arm, while a score of unpaintable, delicate hues stained her cheeks in rapid transition.  \\\"Please don't say any more about it, Maskull.  It makes me feel unpleasant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well.  But can we possibly get there before midday?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes.  And you mustn't be frightened at the distance.  We think nothing of long distances here - we have so much to think about and feel.  Time goes all too quickly.\\\"\\n\\nDuring their conversation they had drawn neat the base of the hills, which sloped gently, and were not above fifty feet in height. Maskull now began to see strange specimens of vegetable life.  What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet square, was moving across the sand in their direction.  When it came near enough he perceived that it was not grass; there were no blades, but only purple roots.  The roots were revolving, for each small plant in the whole patch, like the spokes of a rimless wheel.  They were alternately plunged in the sand, and withdrawn from it, and by this means the plant proceeded forward.  Some uncanny, semi - intelligent instinct was keeping all the plants together, moving at one pace, in one direction, like a flock of migrating birds in flight.\\n\\nAnother remarkable plant was a large, feathery ball, resembling a dandelion fruit, which they encountered sailing through the air. Joiwind caught it with an exceedingly graceful movement of her arm, and showed it to Maskull.  It had roots and presumably lived in the air and fed on the chemical constituents of the atmosphere.  But what was peculiar about it was its colour.  It was an entirely new colour - not a new shade or combination, but a new primary colour, as vivid as blue, red, or yellow, but quite different.  When he inquired, she told him that it was known as \\\"ulfire.\\\" Presently he met with a second new colour.  This she designated \\\"jale.\\\" The sense impressions caused in Maskull by these two additional primary colors can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy.  Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous.\\n\\nThe hills were composed of a rich, dark mould.  Small trees, of weird shapes, all differing from each other, but all purple - coloured, covered the slopes and top.  Maskull and Joiwind climbed up and through.  Some hard fruit, bright blue in colour, of the size of a large apple, and shaped like an egg, was lying in profusion underneath the trees.\\n\\n\\\"Is the fruit here poisonous, or why don't you eat it?\\\" asked Maskull.\\n\\nShe looked at him tranquilly.  \\\"We don't eat living things.  The thought is horrible to us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have nothing to say against that, theoretically.  But do you really sustain your bodies on water?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Supposing you could find nothing else to live on, Maskull - would you eat other men?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Neither will we eat plants and animals, which are our fellow creatures.  So nothing is left to us but water, and as one can really live on anything, water does very well.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull picked up one of the fruits and handled it curiously.  As he did so another of his newly acquired sense organs came into action. He found that the fleshy knobs beneath his ears were in some novel fashion acquainting him with the inward properties of the fruit.  He could not only see, feel, and smell it, but could detect its intrinsic nature.  This nature was hard, persistent and melancholy.\\n\\nJoiwind answered the questions he had not asked.\\n\\n\\\"Those organs are called 'poigns.' Their use is to enable us to understand and sympathise with all living creatures.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What advantage do you derive from that, Joiwind?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The advantage of not being cruel and selfish, dear Maskull.\\\"\\n\\nHe threw the fruit away and flushed again.\\n\\nJoiwind looked into his swarthy, bearded face without embarrassment and slowly smiled.  \\\"Have I said too much?  Have I been too familiar? Do you know why you think so?  It's because you are still impure.  By and by you will listen to all language without shame.\\\"\\n\\nBefore he realised what she was about to do, she threw her tentacle round his neck, like another arm.  He offered no resistance to its cool pressure.  The contact of her soft flesh with his own was so moist and sensitive that it resembled another kind of kiss.  He saw who it was that embraced him -  a pale, beautiful girl.  Yet, oddly enough, he experienced neither voluptuousness nor sexual pride.  The love expressed by the caress was rich, glowing, and personal, but there was not the least trace of sex in it - and so he received it.\\n\\nShe removed her tentacle, placed her two arms on his shoulders and penetrated with her eyes right into his very soul.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I wish to be pure,\\\" he muttered.  \\\"Without that what can I ever be but a weak, squirming devil?\\\"\\n\\nJoiwind released him.  \\\"This we call the 'magn,' \\\" she said, indicating her tentacle.  \\\"By means of it what we love already we love more, and what we don't love at all we begin to love.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A godlike organ!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is the one we guard most jealously,\\\" said Joiwind.\\n\\nThe shade of the trees afforded a timely screen from the now almost insufferable rays of Branchspell, which was climbing steadily upward to the zenith.  On descending the other side of the little hills, Maskull looked anxiously for traces of Nightspore and Krag, but without result.  After staring about him for a few minutes he shrugged his shoulders; but suspicions had already begun to gather in his mind.\\n\\nA small, natural amphitheatre lay at their feet, completely circled by the tree - clad heights.  The centre was of red sand.  In the very middle shot up a tall, stately tree, with a black trunk and branches, and transparent, crystal leaves.  At the foot of this tree was a natural, circular well, containing dark green water.\\n\\nWhen they had reached the bottom, Joiwind took him straight over to the well.\\n\\nMaskull gazed at it intently.  \\\"Is this the shrine you talked about?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.  It is called Shaping's Well.  The man or woman who wishes to invoke Shaping must take up some of the gnawl water, and drink it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pray for me,\\\" said Maskull.  \\\"Your unspotted prayer will carry more weight.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you wish for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For purity,\\\" answered Maskull, in a troubled voice.\\n\\nJoiwind made a cup of her hand, and drank a little of the water.  She held it up to Maskull's mouth.  \\\"You must drink too.\\\" He obeyed.  She then stood erect, closed her eyes, and, in a voice like the soft murmurings of spring, prayed aloud.\\n\\n\\\"Shaping, my father, I am hoping you can hear me.  A strange man has come to us weighed down with heavy blood.  He wishes to be pure.  Let him know the meaning of love, let him live for others.  Don't spare him pain, dear Shaping, but let him seek his own pain.  Breathe into him a noble soul.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull listened with tears in his heart.\\n\\nAs Joiwind finished speaking, a blurred mist came over his eyes, and, half buried in the scarlet sand, appeared a large circle of dazzlingly white pillars.  For some minutes they flickered to and fro between distinctness and indistinctness, like an object being focused.  Then they faded out of sight again.\\n\\n\\\"Is that a sign from Shaping?\\\" asked Maskull, in a low, awed tone.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps it is.  It is a time mirage.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What can that be, Joiwind?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see, dear Maskull, the temple does not yet exist but it will do so, because it must.  What you and I are now doing in simplicity, wise men will do hereafter in full knowledge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is right for man to pray,\\\" said Maskull.  \\\"Good and evil in the world don't originate from nothing.  God and Devil must exist.  And we should pray to the one, and fight the other.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, we must fight Krag.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What name did you say?\\\" asked Maskull in amazement.\\n\\n\\\"Krag - the author of evil and misery - whom you call Devil.\\\"\\n\\nHe immediately concealed his thoughts.  To prevent Joiwind from learning his relationship to this being, he made his mind a blank.\\n\\n\\\"Why do you hide your mind from me?\\\" she demanded, looking at him strangely and changing colour.\\n\\n\\\"In this bright, pure, radiant world, evil seems so remote, one can scarcely grasp its meaning.\\\" But he lied.\\n\\nJoiwind continued gazing at him, straight out of her clean soul. \\\"The world is good and pure, but many men are corrupt.  Panawe, my husband, has travelled, and he has told me things I would almost rather have not heard.  One person he met believed the universe to be, from top to bottom, a conjurer's cave.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should like to meet your husband.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, we are going home now.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull was on the point of inquiring whether she had any children, but was afraid of offending her, and checked himself.\\n\\nShe read the mental question.  \\\"What need is there?  Is not the whole world full of lovely children?  Why should I want selfish possessions?\\\"\\n\\nAn extraordinary creature flew past, uttering a plaintive cry of five distinct notes.  It was not a bird, but had a balloon - shaped body, paddled by five webbed feet.  It disappeared among the trees.\\n\\nJoiwind pointed to it, as it went by.  \\\"I love that beast, grotesque as it is - perhaps all the more for its grotesqueness.  But if I had children of my own, would I still love it?  Which is best - to love two or three, or to love all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Every woman can't be like you, Joiwind, but it is good to have a few like you.  Wouldn't it be as well,\\\" he went on, \\\"since we've got to walk through that sun - baked wilderness, to make turbans for our heads out of some of those long leaves?\\\"\\n\\nShe smiled rather pathetically.  \\\"You will think me foolish, but every tearing off of a leaf would be a wound in my heart.  We have only to throw our robes over our heads.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No doubt that will answer the same purpose, but tell me - weren't these very robes once part of a living creature?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no - no, they are the webs of a certain animal, but they have never been in themselves alive.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You reduce life to extreme simplicity,\\\" remarked Maskull meditatively, \\\"but it is very beautiful.\\\"\\n\\nClimbing back over the hills, they now without further ceremony began their march across the desert.\\n\\nThey walked side by side.  Joiwind directed their course straight toward Poolingdred.  From the position of the sun, Maskull judged their way to lie due north.  The sand was soft and powdery, very tiring to his naked feet.  The red glare dazed his eyes, and made him semi - blind.  He was hot, parched, and tormented with the craving to drink; his undertone of pain emerged into full consciousness.\\n\\n\\\"I see my friends nowhere, and it is very queer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, it is queer - if it is accidental,\\\" said Joiwind, with a peculiar intonation.\\n\\n\\\"Exactly!\\\" agreed Maskull.  \\\"If they had met with a mishap, their bodies would still be there.  It begins to look like a piece of bad work to me.  They must have gone on, and left me.... Well, I am here, and I must make the best of it, I will trouble no more about them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't wish to speak ill of anyone,\\\" said Joiwind, \\\"but my instinct tells me that you are better away from those men.  They did not come here for your sake, but for their own.\\\"\\n\\nThey walked on for a long time.  Maskull was beginning to feel faint. She twined her magn lovingly around his waist, and a strong current of confidence and well - being instantly coursed through his veins.\\n\\n\\\"Thanks, Joiwind!  But am I not weakening you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" she replied, with a quick, thrilling glance.  \\\"But not much - and it gives me great happiness.\\\"\\n\\nPresently they met a fantastic little creature, the size of a new - born lamb, waltzing along on three legs.  Each leg in turn moved to the front, and so the little monstrosity proceeded by means of a series of complete rotations.  It was vividly coloured, as though it had been dipped into pots of bright blue and yellow paint.  It looked up with small, shining eyes, as they passed.\\n\\nJoiwind nodded and smiled to it.  \\\"That's a personal friend of mine, Maskull.  Whenever I come this way, I see it. It's always waltzing, and always in a hurry, but it never seems to get anywhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems to me that life is so self - sufficient here that there is no need for anyone to get anywhere.  What I don't quite understand is how you manage to pass your days without ennui.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's a strange word.  It means, does it not, craving for excitement?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something of the kind,\\\" said Maskull.\\n\\n\\\"That must be a disease brought on by rich food.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But are you never dull?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How could we be?  Our blood is quick and light and free, our flesh is clean and unclogged, inside and out .... Before long I hope you will understand what sort of question you have asked.\\\"\\n\\nFarther on they encountered a strange phenomenon.  In the heart of the desert a fountain rose perpendicularly fifty feet into the air, with a cool and pleasant hissing sound.  It differed, however, from a fountain in this respect - that the water of which it was composed did not return to the ground but was absorbed by the atmosphere at the summit.  It was in fact a tall, graceful column of dark green fluid, with a capital of coiling and twisting vapours.\\n\\nWhen they came closer, Maskull perceived that this water column was the continuation and termination of a flowing brook, which came down from the direction of the mountains.  The explanation of the phenomenon was evidently that the water at this spot found chemical affinities in the upper air, and consequently forsook the ground.\\n\\n\\\"Now let us drink,\\\" said Joiwind.\\n\\nShe threw herself unaffectedly at full length on the sand, face downward, by the side of the brook, and Maskull was not long in following her example.  She refused to quench her thirst until she had seen him drink.  He found the water heavy, but bubbling with gas. He drank copiously.  It affected his palate in a new way - with the purity and cleanness of water was combined the exhilaration of a sparkling wine, raising his spirits - but somehow the intoxication brought out his better nature, and not his lower.\\n\\n\\\"We call it gnawl water',\\\" said Joiwind.  \\\"This is not quite pure, as you can see by the colour.  At Poolingdred it is crystal clear.  But we would be ungrateful if we complained.  After this you'll find we'll get along much better.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull now began to realise his environment, as it were for the first time.  All his sense organs started to show him beauties and wonders that he had not hitherto suspected.  The uniform glaring scarlet of the sands became separated into a score of clearly distinguished shades of red.  The sky was similarly split up into different blues.  The radiant heat of Branchspell he found to affect every part of his body with unequal intensifies.  His ears awakened; the atmosphere was full of murmurs, the sands hummed, even the sun's rays had a sound of their own - a kind of faint Aeolian harp. Subtle, puzzling perfumes assailed his nostrils.  His palate lingered over the memory of the gnawl water.  All the pores of his skin were tickled and soothed by hitherto unperceived currents of air.  His poigns explored actively the inward nature of everything in his immediate vicinity.  His magn touched Joiwind, and drew from her person a stream of love and joy.  And lastly by means of his breve he exchanged thoughts with her in silence.  This mighty sense symphony stirred him to the depths, and throughout the walk of that endless morning he felt no more fatigue.\\n\\nWhen it was drawing near to Blodsombre, they approached the sedgy margin of a dark green lake, which lay underneath Poolingdred.\\n\\nPanawe was sitting on a dark rock, waiting for them.\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\nPANAWE\\n\\nThe husband got up to meet his wife and their guest.  He was clothed in white.  He had a beardless face, with breve and poigns.  His skin, on face and body alike, was so white, fresh, and soft, that it scarcely looked skin at all - it rather resembled a new kind of pure, snowy flesh, extending right down to his bones.  It had nothing in common with the artificially whitened skin of an over-civilised woman.  Its whiteness and delicacy aroused no voluptuous thoughts; it was obviously the manifestation of a cold and almost cruel chastity of nature.  His hair, which fell to the nape of his neck, also was white; but again, from vigour, not decay.  His eyes were black, quiet and fathomless.  He was still a young man, but so stern were his features that he had the appearance of a lawgiver, and this in spite of their great beauty and harmony.\\n\\nHis magn and Joiwind's intertwined for a single moment and Maskull saw his face soften with love, while she looked exultant.  She put him in her husband's arms with gentle force, and stood back, gazing and smiling.  Maskull felt rather embarrassed at being embraced by a man, but submitted to it; a sense of cool, pleasant languor passed through him in the act.\\n\\n\\\"The stranger is red - blooded, then?\\\"\\n\\nHe was startled by Panawe's speaking in English, and the voice too was extraordinary.  It was absolutely tranquil, but its tranquillity seemed in a curious fashion to be an illusion, proceeding from a rapidity of thoughts and feelings so great that their motion could not be detected.  How this could be, he did not know.\\n\\n\\\"How do you come to speak in a tongue you have never heard before?\\\" demanded Maskull.\\n\\n\\\"Thought is a rich, complex thing. I can't say if I am really speaking your tongue by instinct, or if you yourself are translating my thoughts into your tongue as I utter them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Already you see that Panawe is wiser than I am,\\\" said Joiwind gaily.\\n\\n\\\"What is your name?\\\" asked the husband.\\n\\n\\\"Maskull.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That name must have a meaning - but again, thought is a strange thing.  I connect that name with something - but with what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Try to discover,\\\" said Joiwind.\\n\\n\\\"Has there been a man in your world who stole something from the Maker of the, universe, in order to ennoble his fellow creatures?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is such a myth, The hero's name was Prometheus.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, you seem to be identified in my mind with that action - but what it all means I can't say, Maskull.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Accept it as a good omen, for Panawe never lies, and never speaks thoughtlessly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There must be some confusion.  These are heights beyond me,\\\" said Maskull calmly, but looking rather contemplative.\\n\\n\\\"Where do you come from?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From the planet of a distant sun, called Earth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What for?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was tired of vulgarity,\\\" returned Maskull laconically.  He intentionally avoided mentioning his fellow voyagers, in order that Krag's name should not come to light.\\n\\n\\\"That's an honourable motive,\\\" said Panawe.  \\\"And what's more, it may be true, though you spoke it as a prevarication.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As far as it goes, it's quite true,\\\" said Maskull, staring at him with annoyance and surprise.\\n\\nThe swampy lake extended for about half a mile from where they were standing to the lower buttresses of the mountain.  Feathery purple reeds showed themselves here and there through the shallows.  The water was dark green.  Maskull did not see how they were going to cross it.\\n\\nJoiwind caught his arm.  \\\"Perhaps you don't know that the lake will bear us?\\\"\\n\\nPanawe walked onto the water; it was so heavy that it carried his weight.  Joiwind followed with Maskull.  He instantly started to slip about - nevertheless the motion was amusing, and he learned so fast, by watching and imitating Panawe, that he was soon able to balance himself without assistance.  After that he found the sport excellent.\\n\\nFor the same reason that women excel in dancing, Joiwind's half falls and recoveries were far more graceful and sure than those of either of the men.  Her slight, draped form - dipping, bending, rising, swaying, twisting, upon the surface of the dark water - this was a picture Maskull could not keep his eyes away from.\\n\\nThe lake grew deeper.  The gnawl water became green - black.  The crags, gullies, and precipices of the shore could now be distinguished in detail.  A waterfall was visible, descending several hundred feet.  The surface of the lake grew disturbed - so much so that Maskull had difficulty in keeping his balance.  He therefore threw himself down and started swimming on the face of the water. Joiwind turned her head, and laughed so joyously that all her teeth flashed in the sunlight.\\n\\nThey landed in a few more minutes on a promontory of black rock.  The water on Maskull's garment and body evaporated very quickly.  He gazed upward at the towering mountain, but at that moment some strange movements on the part of Panawe attracted his attention.  His face was working convulsively, and he began to stagger about.  Then he put his hand to his mouth and took from it what looked like a bright - coloured pebble.  He looked at it carefully for some seconds.  Joiwind also looked, over his shoulder, with quickly changing colors.  After this inspection, Panawe let the object - whatever it was - fall to the ground, and took no more interest in it.\\n\\n\\\"May I look?\\\" asked Maskull; and, without waiting for permission, he picked it up.  It was a delicately beautiful egg - shaped crystal of pale green.\\n\\n\\\"Where did this come from?\\\" he asked queerly.\\n\\nPanawe turned away, but Joiwind answered for him.  \\\"It came out of my husband.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's what I thought, but I couldn't believe it.  But what is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know that it has either name or use.  It is merely an overflowing of beauty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Beauty?\\\"\\n\\nJoiwind smiled.  \\\"If you were to regard nature as the husband, and Panawe as the wife, Maskull, perhaps everything would be explained.\\\"\\n\\nMaskull reflected.\\n\\n\\\"On Earth,\\\" he said after a minute, \\\"men like Panawe are called artists, poets, and musicians.  Beauty overflows into them too, and out of them again.  The only distinction is that their productions are more human and intelligible.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing comes from it but vanity,\\\" said Panawe, and, taking the crystal out of Maskull's hand, he threw it into the lake.\\n\\nThe precipice they now had to climb was several hundred feet in height.  Maskull was more anxious for Joiwind than for himself.  She was evidently tiring, but she refused all help, and was in fact still the nimbler of the two.  She made a mocking face at him.  Panawe seemed lost in quiet thoughts.  The rock was sound, and did not crumble under their weight.  The heat of Branchspell, however, was by this time almost killing, the radiance was shocking in its white intensity, and Maskull's pain steadily grew worse.\\n\\nWhen they got to the top, a plateau of dark rock appeared, bare of vegetation, stretching in both directions as far as the eye could see.  It was of a nearly uniform width of five hundred yards, from the edge of the cliffs to the lower slopes of the chain of hills inland.  The hills varied in height.  The cup - shaped Poolingdred was approximately a thousand feet above them.  The upper part of it was covered with a kind of glittering vegetation which he could not comprehend.\\n\\nJoiwind put her hand on Maskull's shoulder, and pointed upward. \\\"Here you have the highest peak in the whole land - that is, until you come to the Ifdawn Marest.\\\"\\n\\nOn hearing that strange name, he experienced a momentary unaccountable sensation of wild vigour and restlessness - but it passed away.\\n\\nWithout losing time, Panawe led the way up the mountainside.  The lower half was of bare rock, not difficult to climb.  Halfway up, however, it grew steeper, and they began to meet bushes and small trees.  The growth became thicker as they continued to ascend, and when they neared the summit, tall forest trees appeared.\\n\\nThese bushes and trees had pale, glassy trunks and branches, but the small twigs and the leaves were translucent and crystal.  They cast no shadows from above, but still the shade was cool.  Both leaves and branches were fantastically shaped.  What surprised Maskull the most, however, was the fact that, as far as he could see, scarcely any two plants belonged to the same species.\\n\\n\\\"Won't you help Maskull out of his difficulty?\\\" said Joiwind, pulling her husband's arm.\\n\\nHe smiled.  \\\"If he'll forgive me for again trespassing in his brain. But the difficulty is small.  Life on a new planet, Maskull, is necessarily energetic and lawless, and not sedate and imitative. Nature is still fluid - not yet rigid - and matter is plastic.  The will forks and sports incessantly, and thus no two creatures are alike.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, I understand all that,\\\" replied Maskull, after listening attentively.  \\\"But what I don't grasp is this - if living creatures here sport so energetically, how does it come about that human beings wear much the same shape as in my world?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll explain that too,\\\" said Panawe.  \\\"All creatures that resemble Shaping must of necessity resemble one another.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then sporting is the blind will to become like Shaping?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Exactly.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637648394,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"I came with two other men, in a machine.
