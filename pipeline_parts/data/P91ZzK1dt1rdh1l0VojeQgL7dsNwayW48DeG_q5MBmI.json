"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"```\\nTHIS story really consists of two parts. The first part might be\\n```\\n\\nleft out, but it gives us a few particulars, and these are useful\\n\\n```\\nWe were staying in the country at a gentleman's seat, where it\\n```\\n\\nhappened that the master was absent for a few days. In the meantime,\\n\\nthere arrived from the next town a lady; she had a pug dog with her,\\n\\nand came, she said, to dispose of shares in her tan-yard. She had\\n\\nher papers with her, and we advised her to put them in an envelope,\\n\\nand to write thereon the address of the proprietor of the estate,\\n\\n\\\"General War-Commissary Knight,\\\" &c.\\n\\n```\\nShe listened to us attentively, seized the pen, paused, and begged\\n```\\n\\nus to repeat the direction slowly. We complied, and she wrote; but\\n\\nin the midst of the \\\"General War-\\\" she struck fast, sighed deeply, and\\n\\nsaid, \\\"I am only a woman!\\\" Her Puggie had seated itself on the\\n\\nground while she wrote, and growled; for the dog had come with her for\\n\\namusement and for the sake of its health; and then the bare floor\\n\\nought not to be offered to a visitor. His outward appearance was\\n\\ncharacterized by a snub nose and a very fat back.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"He doesn't bite,\\\" said the lady; \\\"he has no teeth. He is like one\\n```\\n\\nof the family, faithful and grumpy; but the latter is my\\n\\ngrandchildren's fault, for they have teased him; they play at wedding,\\n\\nand want to give him the part of the bridesmaid, and that's too much\\n\\nfor him, poor old fellow.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nAnd she delivered her papers, and took Puggie upon her arm. And\\n```\\n\\nthis is the first part of the story which might have been left out.\\n\\n```\\nPUGGIE DIED!! That's the second part.\\n\\nIt was about a week afterwards we arrived in the town, and put\\n```\\n\\nup at the inn. Our windows looked into the tan-yard, which was divided\\n\\ninto two parts by a partition of planks; in one half were many skins\\n\\nand hides, raw and tanned. Here was all the apparatus necessary to\\n\\ncarry on a tannery, and it belonged to the widow. Puggie had died in\\n\\nthe morning, and was to be buried in this part of the yard; the\\n\\ngrandchildren of the widow (that is, of the tanner's widow, for Puggie\\n\\nhad never been married) filled up the grave, and it was a beautiful\\n\\ngrave- it must have been quite pleasant to lie there.\\n\\n```\\nThe grave was bordered with pieces of flower-pots and strewn\\n```\\n\\nover with sand; quite at the top they had stuck up half a beer bottle,\\n\\nwith the neck upwards, and that was not at all allegorical.\\n\\n```\\nThe children danced round the grave, and the eldest of the boys\\n```\\n\\namong them, a practical youngster of seven years, made the proposition\\n\\nthat there should be an exhibition of Puggie's burial-place for all\\n\\nwho lived in the lane; the price of admission was to be a trouser\\n\\nbutton, for every boy would be sure to have one, and each might also\\n\\ngive one for a little girl. This proposal was adopted by acclamation.\\n\\n```\\nAnd all the children out of the lane- yes, even out of the\\n```\\n\\nlittle lane at the back- flocked to the place, and each gave a button.\\n\\nMany were noticed to go about on that afternoon with only one\\n\\nsuspender; but then they had seen Puggie's grave, and the sight was\\n\\nworth much more.\\n\\n```\\nBut in front of the tan-yard, close to the entrance, stood a\\n```\\n\\nlittle girl clothed in rags, very pretty to look at, with curly\\n\\nhair, and eyes so blue and clear that it was a pleasure to look into\\n\\nthem. The child said not a word, nor did she cry; but each time the\\n\\nlittle door was opened she gave a long, long look into the yard. She\\n\\nhad not a button- that she knew right well, and therefore she remained\\n\\nstanding sorrowfully outside, till all the others had seen the grave\\n\\nand had gone away; then she sat down, held her little brown hands\\n\\nbefore her eyes, and burst into tears; this girl alone had not seen\\n\\nPuggie's grave. It was a grief as great to her as any grown person can\\n\\nexperience.\\n\\n```\\nWe saw this from above; and looked at from above, how many a grief\\n```\\n\\nof our own and of others can make us smile! That is the story, and\\n\\nwhoever does not understand it may go and purchase a share in the\\n\\ntan-yard from the window.\\n\\n```\\n                        THE END\\n```\\n\\n.\",\"timestamp\":1636537705,\"title\":\"    FAIRY TALES OF HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN\"},\"digest\":\"yFSr9HbYO-9PBmI8yh2Ge0xl6lr1yRR5WokOjX6ky5U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3dD2445439d0e0b486114E6168109d8644d9C712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyAaJ1EAuvVpS-JCywn_TPdHayLNwYfpGlVfmQX423A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qvD55WLlaKEnctSQLdN0XBl8FQutFQSnA12YF0vaz0w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KFvT70PilctcvcVo70YIiGyIbN8S6G9__8dfJ3JuH2JRN5qFlD-IYxzqY0D1NPE1I1E80U7m_XDILLNwF4fTcw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x824f846089b5274e8fa63a3d3b74975a03790453b35045c365fd03178c4babf22c613267bddb371e8ea1a542aa21efc12bb3dd9f50ada8c4257f8f3bb01280121b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyAaJ1EAuvVpS-JCywn_TPdHayLNwYfpGlVfmQX423A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qvD55WLlaKEnctSQLdN0XBl8FQutFQSnA12YF0vaz0w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yFSr9HbYO-9PBmI8yh2Ge0xl6lr1yRR5WokOjX6ky5U\"}"
