"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Yes--certainly. Don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have known him so intimately for so many years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but that does not change him. Does it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. But it may make him appear very differently to me from the way in which he shows himself to others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think if I knew Monsieur Emile for centuries I should always wonder about him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it in Emile that makes you wonder?\\\" asked her mother, with a real curiosity.\\n\\n\\\"The same thing that makes me wonder when I look at a sleepy lion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You call Emile sleepy!\\\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, not his intellect, Madre! Of course that is horribly, horribly wide awake.\\\"\\n\\nAnd Vere ran off to her room, or the garden, or the Saint's Pool--who knew where?--leaving her mother to say to herself, as she had already said to herself in these last days of the growing summer, \\\"When I said that to Emile, what a fool I was!\\\" She was thinking of her statement that there was nothing in her child that was hidden from her. As if in answer to that statement, Vere was unconsciously showing to her day by day the folly of it. Emile had said nothing. Hermione remembered that, and realized that his silence had been caused by his disagreement. But why had he not told her she was mistaken? Perhaps because she had just been laying bare to him the pain that was in her heart. Her call had been for sympathy, not merely for truth. She wondered whether she was a coward. Since they had returned from Capri the season and Vere had surely changed. Then, and always afterwards, Hermione thought of those three days in Capri as a definite barrier, a dividing line between two periods. Already, while in Capri, she had begun to watch her child in a new way. But that was, perhaps, because of an uneasiness, partly nervous, within herself. In Capri she might have been imagining. Now she was not imagining, she was realizing.\\n\\nOver the sea came to the islet the intensity of summer. Their world was changing. And in this changing world Vere was beginning to show forth more clearly than before her movement onward--whither?\\n\\nAs yet the girl herself was unconscious of her mother's new watchfulness. She was happy in the coming of summer, and in her happiness was quite at ease, like a kitten that stretches itself luxuriously in the sun. To Vere the world never seemed quite awake till the summer came. Only in the hot sunshine did there glow the truthfulness and the fulness of life. She shared it with the ginestra. She saw and felt a certain cruelty in the gold, but she did not fear or condemn it, or wish it away. For she was very young, and though she spoke of cruelty she did not really understand it. In it there was force, and force already appealed to the girl as few things did. As, long ago, her father had gloried in the coming of summer to the South, she gloried in it now. She looked across the Pool of the Saint to the flood of yellow that was like sunlight given a body upon the cliff opposite, and her soul revelled within her, and her heart rose up and danced, alone, and yet as if in a glad company of dancers, all of whom were friends. Her brain, too, sprang to the alert. The sun increased the feeling of intelligence within her.\\n\\nAnd then she thought of her room, of the hours she passed shut in there, and she was torn by opposing impulses.\\n\\nBut she told no one of them. Vere could keep her secrets although she was a girl.\\n\\nHow the sea welcomed the summer! To many this home on the island would have seemed an arid, inhospitable place, desolate and lost amid a cruel world of cliffs and waters. It was not so to Vere. For she entered into the life of the sea. She knew all its phases, as one may know all the moods of a person loved. She knew when she would find it intensely calm, at early morning and when the evening approached. At a certain hour, with a curious regularity, the breeze came, generally from Ischia, and turned it to vivacity. A temper that was almost frivolous then possessed it, and it broke into gayeties like a child's. The waves were small, but they were impertinently lively. They made a turmoil such as urchins make at play. Heedless of reverence, but not consciously impious, they flung themselves at the feet of San Francesco, casting up a tiny tribute of spray into the sun.\\n\\nThen Vere thought that the Saint looked down with pleasure at them, as a good old man looks at a crowd of laughing children who have run against him in the street, remembering his own youth. For even the Saints were young! And, after that, surely the waves were a little less boisterous. She thought she noted a greater calm. But perhaps it was only that the breeze was dying down as the afternoon wore on.\\n\\nShe often sat and wondered which she loved best--the calm that lay upon the sea at dawn, or the calm that was the prelude to the night. Silvery were these dawns of the summer days. Here and there the waters gleamed like the scales of some lovely fish. Mysterious lights, like those in the breast of the opal, shone in the breast of the sea, stirred, surely travelled as if endowed with life, then sank away to the far-off kingdoms that man may never look on. Those dawns drew away the girl's soul as if she were led by angels, or, like Peter, walked upon the deep at some divine command. She felt that though her body was on the islet the vital part of her, the real \\\"I,\\\" was free to roam across the great expanse that lay flat and still and delicately mysterious to the limits of eternity.\\n\\nShe had strange encounters there, the soul of her, as she went towards the East.\\n\\nThe evening calm was different. There was, Vere thought, less of heaven about it, but perhaps more of the wonder of this world. And this made her feel as if she had been nearer to heaven at her birth than she would be at her death. She knew nothing of the defilements of life. Her purity of mind was very perfect; but, taking a parable from Nature, she applied it imaginatively to Man, and she saw him covered with dust because of his journey through the world. Poor man!\\n\\nAnd then she pitied herself too. But that passed. For if the sea at evening held most of the wonder of this world, it was worth the holding. Barely would she substitute the heavenly mysteries for it. The fishermen's boats were dreams upon a dream. Each sail was akin to a miracle. A voice that called across the water from a distance brought tears to Vere's eyes when the magic was at its fullest. For it seemed to mean all things that were tender, all things that were wistful, all things that trembled with hope--that trembled with love.\\n\\nWith summer Vere could give herself up to the sea, and not only imaginatively but by a bodily act.\\n\\n\\\"Yes--certainly. Don't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have known him so intimately for so many years.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but that does not change him. Does it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. But it may make him appear very differently to me from the way in which he shows himself to others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think if I knew Monsieur Emile for centuries I should always wonder about him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it in Emile that makes you wonder?\\\" asked her mother, with a real curiosity.\\n\\n\\\"The same thing that makes me wonder when I look at a sleepy lion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You call Emile sleepy!\\\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, not his intellect, Madre!
