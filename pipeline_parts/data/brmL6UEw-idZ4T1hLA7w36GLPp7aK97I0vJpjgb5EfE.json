"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### People are bright!\\n\\nThey intuit that which they cannot fathom. They might not be able to do a multi variant analyses of the underlying causes, and therefore often blame the wrong things, though their intuition expressed as feeling is rarely wrong.\\n\\nSo what do we make of the constant refrain that seems to echo through time?\\n\\n> For whosoever has, to him shall be given, and he shall have more abundance: but whosoever has not, from him shall be taken away even what he has. \\\\\\n>\\n>\\n> Matthew 13:12\\n\\n### The scapegoats\\n\\nAnd there are many.\\n\\nYou will find blue haired mastodons screaming abuse at everything from bankers to politicians. Multi national corporations to agri-tech.\\n\\nAnd chinless public school cucks blaming the feckless lower, than them, classes to immigrants. Schools to the overly generous, shallow laughs permitted, social security.\\n\\nAn oversimplification of a massive topic might be that the left blames a rigged system, and the right the inherent inability of those they distain from being able to steal as much money as themselves.\\n\\n### Define Poor\\n\\nWell let me first state that I don’t see this being entirely about money. Intuition does not follow the same spreadsheet formulas in use by those distanced from it.\\n\\nSo let’s define poorer more broadly, as fewer opportunities for personal advancement or choice; a greater struggle for meaning or fulfillment; a state of desperation.\\n\\nClearly this definition spreads the net far wider than mere economics.\\n\\n### Define Rich\\n\\n“Money may not make you happy, but at least you can choose the colour of your misery.” Quipped some millionaire or other. Money is an enabler, it allows good men to do good things and bad men to do bad things. It is entirely neutral spiritually.\\n\\nIndeed I suspect we all consider some people to have rich lives irrespective of their socioeconomic status. Similarly some extremely wealthy people appear to wallow in misery despite their resources.\\n\\nIf we take a leaf from those dissafected English terrorists who the Gumps wrongly think of as Americans ( they only became American several years after the Declaration of Independence, after the treaty of Paris specifically) then their constitution gives a decent precis for richness.\\n\\n> We hold these truths to be sacred & undeniable; that all men are created equal & independent, that from that equal creation they derive rights inherent & inalienable, among which are the preservation of life, & liberty, & the pursuit of happiness; …\\n\\n### What does the persuit of happiness look like?\\n\\nWell we could tax our grey matter in general terms on this, but it is an individualistic thing. Or we could tax our purple matter and ask our knobs.. Which is both more amusing and more revealing.\\n\\nGranted the answer may come back as two Swedish bisexual supermodels on a weekend in Las Vegas. Which only begs the question of what would the persuit of happiness would look like from penis height after a few gullible individuals have believed your lies about such.\\n\\nAnd I think the answer is rather old fashioned in many ways. Once said Swedish supermodels have been ticked off the universal bucket list the ambition for most remains a family and monogamous lifelong relationship; the resources to raise your children and eventually retire in reasonable comfort to reminisce about Swedish supermodels.\\n\\n### So why do we all think the rich are getting richer, and the poor poorer?\\n\\nHypergamy basically.\\n\\nDefined as:\\n\\n> the action of marrying a person of a superior caste or class.\\n\\nWomen are hypergamous. Always have been.\\n\\nAn interesting exercise is to have a look through women’s dating profiles for those childless somewhat long in the tooth and short of body clock. No matter how hideous, poorly educated or fat they all appear to think they deserve a prince!\\n\\nMen rate women’s attractiveness on such as a perfect bell curve, the average being a 5/10. Women on the other hand rate men such that they consider 93% to be below averagely attractive. With no 10/10s at all.\\n\\nIt was once said that Tory MPs had sex scandals and Labour MPs had financial scandals.. As they were hoping to steal enough cash to have a sex scandal. So this isn’t restricted to social spheres.\\n\\nNor the physicality of location, due to internet dating mostly.\\n\\n### Hypergamy\\n\\nAffects every aspect of a chap’s persuit of happiness.\\n\\nWhether your knob, your wallet or the wider macro economics the strange and malign confluence of fascistic feminism with the pre existing hypergamic culture has reduced many chap’s pussy persuits to practically zero.\\n\\nAs feminist teachers undermark boy’s coursework at school we see fewer boys growing up to be graduate men. Which has already resulted in almost 2/3rds of recent graduates being female. Putting half those females out of hypergamic reach.\\n\\nAs feminists lobby for higher paid and easier jobs for women it leaves men with the lower paid 3D ( Difficult, Dangerous or Dirty) jobs, and puts those better paid women out of hypergamic reach of them.\\n\\nAs feminists lobby for ever more ridiculous prosecutions against men, and longer sentences too, it leaves more men with criminal records to be scorned by hypergamic women. The prison gender gap is already 20.6 men to every woman and growing.\\n\\nMeanwhile those tall, educated and rich enough to pick and choose gain a second high earner so the disposable income generated is considerable. At least until she files for no fault divorce, steals his house, assets and children and ruins his life for no good reason.\\n\\nBut even here hypergamy works overtime. The now poor bloke has to wine dine and chase, which as George Harrison put it, “Take’s a whole lot of spending money”, where the divorced woman is wined, dined and chased.\\n\\nCourse it also results in the mad old cat ladies who now seem to be giving up any idea of procreating, despite being in their early 40s.\\n\\n### The ratio\\n\\nIn wiser days women were paid less than men for the same work. Hence allowing even their mere peers to have a sniff.\\n\\nWith women’s net hourly wages increasingly overtaking men’s (certainly true for the under 30s) let’s have a look at the ratio of women available to three hypothetical blokes.\\n\\n**Bloke A** is a tall grad with his own house. He basically has the pick of the field, though may well simply pick the best set of tits unintentionally leaving another cat lady in his wake. And depriving the other tiers of a potential mate in the process.\\n\\n**Ratio 1:1**. Combined disposable income \\\\~£30,000 p/a\\n\\n**Bloke B** dropped out of Uni and works in a call centre. The 50% of women who graduated are beyond him, as are the feckless feminists promoted ahead of him for their ‘superior communication skills’ – otherwise known as nagging and getting someone else to do their work for them.\\n\\nSo he might be reasonable in thinking that 1/3 of the availble pussy is possible. But he competes with the myriad other blokes in a similar position, and those from the A tier. This third of women probably has to choose between realistically 2/3s of them men. Let’s be generous here…\\n\\n**Ratio 6:1** Combined disposable income \\\\~£5,000 p/a\\n\\n**Bloke C** is short, ginger and works in a 3D job at not much above minimum wage. All of the University grads, all of the better paid safe and comfy job females are out of sight. He’s left with the thick, lazy or unsuccessful. And competes with the tiers above him for even their affections.\\n\\n**Ratio: 20:1**. Combined disposable income \\\\~ £bugger all.\\n\\n### The Punchline\\n\\nSadly this isn’t comedy.. Standing in line to be punched in the dick is probably a good analogy for our young dudes on their way to finding out that the poor do indeed get poorer. And I cite this objectively for the underclass. The extreme end is called the Incel movement… Involunarily celibates. They deserve our compassion and action, but receive nothing but mockery.\\n\\nTake the sad wretches described in Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier (1937). Their economic prospects were undeniably poor, their lives tough and their plight only covered by a chinless socialist snob on a jolly. Who incidentally only studied them, like ants, to determine why they were too stupid to revolt.\\n\\nThe nation they built though was capable of great things, as we discovered against an Austrian dude of historical significance just a few years after the tome hit the posh bookstores. Their labour and the coal they dug powered the nation during the war and they reaped the benefits of the technology developed during it to lead happy retirements, surrounded by their grand children.\\n\\nWhilst routinely displaying feats of strength and endurance probably beyond our athletes these days their pussy prospects were no worse than any other generation before.\\n\\nThese same, usually socially conservative, voices were the ones betrayed by no fault divorce and other feminist nonsense.. Robbing future generations of the only thing that adequately aleviates a life of poverty.\\n\\nConsider too the poor drudges who emigrated here, or their grown up children. Have a look at the wallflowers next time you are out in a nightclub and you’ll notice a clear trend. Whilst Londoners salivate over the notion of signalling their virtue by dint of having a black lass clean their bog they don’t marry them…\\n\\nIn group preference in sexual partner is neither controversial nor arguable, the statistics are stark.\\n\\nSo next time you hear of a Muslim terrorist attrocity consider why a young dude with few prospects other than his cousin might blow up a concert for young girls, or indeed why so many school shootings in the USA are attributed to Incels.\\n\\nMaybe the two are more… intimately.. linked than you realise?\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635292985,\"title\":\"The poor poorer and the rich richer\"},\"digest\":\"GAV1XAPhSaF0IaoMrWA2t4jRbHrQEz2kXEIb1K6O5g0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD5EAbC1973b7d580D37ae256398eEF0977d05FA5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3dYFNcZA1jaH_QhysafO7jfVV93aPbETh4_14D0ChwI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jcPPFWoHUULNoAaBuW5YTjzaJ2_yoRGoHHjZM4y3bv8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"J47dPL7k7w2euTAlAtgO6VzmJ_avHQBy3Xkw2okI6mr-168ta19IXd0xyXKdZT4nuIxUyizVF6dJ5GPPdTXXzA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3c25cf1d7dc15fb2e7a47d897eec65fdf55807c2ad809055690074b68c9dc8875fd1e6f4f4d342d9ef23a9a9e1923e64d260f2629efe81d2827e204f2a78a8bf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"3dYFNcZA1jaH_QhysafO7jfVV93aPbETh4_14D0ChwI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jcPPFWoHUULNoAaBuW5YTjzaJ2_yoRGoHHjZM4y3bv8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GAV1XAPhSaF0IaoMrWA2t4jRbHrQEz2kXEIb1K6O5g0\"}"
