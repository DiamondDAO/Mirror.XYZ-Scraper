"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Background\\n\\nFarmers World is the first agriculture simulation game running on the NFTs platform. Players pick their tools to exploit resources and buy lands to build their farms while they are enjoying woking as a farmer in the ecosystem.\\n\\nSimilar to the Alien Worlds, players need tools ( like Stone Axe, Fishing Rod and Mining Excavator ) at stake for farming the resources (like Wood, Food and Gold respectively). By collecting the resources, players can mint tools as NFTs and sell them to get return. Since the scarcity tends to makes item more expensive, players potentially can sell thier NFTs if there is less available. A normal NFT Axe is selling at 6,400 Wax (\\\\~$1,400) .\\n\\nAccording to the DappRadar, Farmers World is the fastest growing P2E(Play to Earn) game on Wax platform. Its monthly average transcation number reaches 450M till end of September even though the game came online on Aug.1st\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*sO4cTlgh4A68CJZY.png)\\n\\nFarmers World is built on Wax blockchain by anonymous team. There is no public information of financing but the game development by the team is smooth and fast. According to its roadmap, the game is still in the first phase where they are finishing the design of the initial game mechaism, the contract development, theUI design and the web page client.\\n\\nIn the following month, they are planning to accomplish\\n\\n1. Clients on iOS and Android\\n2. Land Sale System\\n3. Pet System\\n4. PVE system.\\n5. Daily Tasks\\n\\nIn the long plan, they will try to add Forging Weapons, Teammates, Defending Farms from Intruders, Exchanging information with other games and Land sales system. Clearly, more features will be added to enrich the players’ experience.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*uweCzm8AQCqghfC2.png)\\n\\n## Wax blockchain\\n\\nWax is a blockchain which focuses on the in-game collectibles and digital assets. Interestingly, its development team call it ‘the King of NFT’ on its official website.\\n\\nThe mainnet of Wax blockchain came online in June, 2019. With modification on EOS, Wax can handle high TPS(transactions per second) by using DPos(Delegated proof of stake) so that they can attracts blockchain game developers. Theoretically, Wax can reach 3000 TPS.\\n\\nThe development team of Wax blockchain is the same team who developed online digital assets exchange OPSkins. They claim that they are capaple of dealing with 2,000,000 transcations per week so that they are also capable of sustaining the operation efficiency of Wax blockchain. In addition, Wax team corperates with Xsolla, Animoca Brands and etc to release NFTs of deadmau5, Atari, William Shatner and Capcom. Moreover, Carbage Pal Kids will isssue its digital collectible corperating with Wax team. According to Cointelegraph, the gaint of trading-card company Topps launch its NFT cards based on Wax blockchain and it is of great success that 70,000 packs of cigarette-case NFTs are sold in an hour, which breaks the record of NFT seles from Topps. William Quigely, who is the CEO of Wax team, wax the co-founder of Thther, has a broad investemment layour over blockchain industry.\\n\\nJust like FLow blockchain, Wax focus on the NFT and does not try to be a universal public blockchain. Meanwhile, the team is commited to make NFTs to flow among differents Dapps so that the ‘life span’ and liquidity of NFTs can be immensely improved. In addition, it attracts other blockchain developers due to its significant input to the cross-chain techonology\\n\\n## Economic Model\\n\\nThere are 3 different types of resources which correspond to 3 different tokens respectively:\\n\\n1. Food (F) — FWF\\n2. Wood (W) — FWW\\n3. Gold (G) — FWG\\n\\nAll resources can be coverted into thier corresponding tokens by handing in the 5%-8% fees which is determined by the system dynamically (fees refresh per hour).\\n\\nThe token can be converted into their correpsonding resources without any fees.\\n\\nFood: Food is the energy source in the game. 1 Food = 5 Energy\\n\\nDuring mining, it takes different energy when your are using different tools. The initial energy of each farmer is 200 while the maximum energy is 500 if you do not have a membership card.\\n\\nYou can farm food with 3 different tools: Fishing Rod, Fishing Net and Finishing Boat.\\n\\nWood: Wood is the main source of minting NFTs in the game and it can only used so.\\n\\nYou can farm wood with 4 different tools: Stone Axe, Axe, Saw, Chain Saw\\n\\nGold: Gold is the durability source in the game and minting NFTs requires gold as well. 1 Gold = 5 Durability\\n\\nYou can farm gold with only 1 tool: Mining Excavator\\n\\nWe can summurize the above by the following plot\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*JCf_kGGNlty4Wo1m.png)\\n\\nFrom the above plot, we can see that the Wood consumption is huge in the early stage of the game, while the gold consumption would be huge as well over the life span of the game since\\n\\nBy comparing with Axie Infinity, there are only two tokens in Axie Infinity: SLP(Breeding and Reward token) and AXS(Game governance token), while, in Farmers World, there are 3 tokens which all only acts as resources but there is no governance token existing. Though players cannot take part in DAO of the game, the system which consists of three tokens can be more sustainable compared with Axie Inifinity’s two-token system.\\n\\n## Equipment System\\n\\nThree tokens can be mined by or be converted into different tools/equipments.\\n\\nThe following pictures shows the relationships:\\n\\n* Food\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*C8fj4T3jK-8pmY0U.jpeg)\\n\\n* Wood\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*hAYHJTDm7A3IHk_2.jpeg)\\n\\n* Gold\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*0VVBifVunjqMjjRW.jpeg)\\n\\nNow we can see that, different tools can mine out different resources and are made by different amount of resources. The resources token can be traded on Aclor: <https://wax.alcor.exchange/markets>\\n\\n## Membership System\\n\\nIn Farmers World, all tools can be used to mine after the cooldown (which usually is one hour). You have to click on the button every hour instead of automation by computers, which is unstainable for players who want to maximize profit.\\n\\nTo solve the problem, Farmers’ World’s team launched membership system: players with different memberships can acummulate/store their mining times to different caps. In addition, players might mine out more resources besed on lucky points which is determined by thier memberships. Moreover, players with membership are allowed to equip more mining tools at the same time while normal players can only equip two tools at the same time for one specific resources.\\n\\nThere are 4 levels of membership:\\n\\n1. Bronze Member\\n2. Silver Member\\n3. Gold Member\\n4. Diamond Member\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*lnTpzRzGeIgT1Dua.jpeg)\\n\\n## Gametaverse Strategy on Farmers’ World\\n\\n## 1. Wax wallet and Farmers’ World account\\n\\nBefore signing up for the Farmers’ World, we need to sign up for a Wax wallet and deposit some WAXP to the wallet to buy resources token needed. The Wax wallet website: <https://wallet.wax.io/>\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*DKRvtgraK8MPp-oF.png)\\n\\nAfter depositing WAXP to the wallet, click on Resources button on the right hand side. Stake small amount of WAXP (10 each) to get resources for CPU, NET and RAM so that you can play the game smoothly without errors shown.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*5GIFbfeYAL1D_ADS.png)\\n\\nThen we can go to the Farmers’ World Website: <https://farmersworld.io/>.\\n\\nClick on Play&Earn and it will show the login page.\\n\\nClick on “Wax Cloud Wallet” and it will show the login page of Wax wallet. After login, it will transfer to the main page of the game.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*bhI6i_R9vH3tjmoE.png)\\n\\nSince you have no tools at start, you cannot do anything. Therefore, the next step is to by the equipments required.\\n\\n## 2. Get Mining Equipment\\n\\nThere are two ways to get mining equipments (NFTs).\\n\\n1. Buy NFTs minted by other players from the AtomicHub NFT exchange: <https://wax.atomichub.io/market>\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*Fj6zwLodmhpxBYy_.png)\\n\\n2\\\\. Mint NFTs by buying resources needed from the Alcor Exchange: <https://wax.alcor.exchange/markets>.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*OfIwqgSt057aA3lX.png)\\n\\nThen click on the Exchange button on the bottom of the game page to convert tokens to the corresponding resources\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*XIitFbYSdmB7QIq5.png)\\n\\nGo to the ‘Smithy’ page and choose the tools you need. Click on the ‘Craft’.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*3MgeoxI13BYayfT0.png)\\n\\nAfter crafting, go to ‘Chest’ to wear the equipments\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*tOK5kb2xX_X3qB9d.png)\\n\\nLastly, you can go to the home page to start mining.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*zI1agCjypwLeDv4C.png)\\n\\n## 3. Strategy\\n\\nThe strategy is easy: get your mining equipment ready and start mining.\\n\\nBut there are two main questions:\\n\\n1. Which way to get equiment is more cost-efficient, buying NFTs or minting NFTs?\\n2. Which equipment has the highest ROI?\\n\\nTo answer this, someone has made a website to answer it all. The website address: <https://fw.f12key.xyz/>\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*qkF8wZ4F25skZALE.png)\\n\\nTake the above picture as an example. In order to get shortest payback cycle, we should choose Chiansaw. Because, firstly, there is no Chainsaw for sale on the Secondary Market (AtomicHub). Moreover, its payback cycle is 23 days since its minting cost is 58,284 WAXP and daily revenue is 2,490 WAXP. Therefore, its APR is 1537% if you can keep on mining after each cooldown. Therefore, a automation script which helps you to mine without you munually clicking on the button is needed.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nFarmers World is not only a playable game, but also a game which potentially can generate high revenues. AtomicHub is a vital secondary market where a Mining Excavator can be sold at $15,000, which shows a great potential of the blockchain games.\",\"timestamp\":1634714736,\"title\":\"Farmers World Ultimate Guide: Fastest Growing Game on Wax\"},\"digest\":\"hJYJvVREde8sISHnlil0hKSJvvEJgM2A8XRBu9x_K_w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd09adB0dc4CD3fF388f783fa78B51A86b0eFB439\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"an1yRxkoUFzYBblkIJDYoh7x2r7t1-Ryi4VA67SDnig\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"S3O24rZMR0lPn_VpxbsOoWpJo49AztVWkpfgx1gn2Xo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5w8mUbJF2hkfwpUw9c_WSweMQWWzVtHEBFGUDQcB6uYLPnIZj4vsurmszP8kd_Cb8vEs7bRXLDP0a1lLcsVxuQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe1e3f92017db5e53a79c9fc0f1801b9ceac35ab6e8abf5fb6ea52695ba4f80fa400cc1d100c6cfe45d23a48945fd9dd896f79113b846a9697cfa3a2937729c891c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"an1yRxkoUFzYBblkIJDYoh7x2r7t1-Ryi4VA67SDnig\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"S3O24rZMR0lPn_VpxbsOoWpJo49AztVWkpfgx1gn2Xo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hJYJvVREde8sISHnlil0hKSJvvEJgM2A8XRBu9x_K_w\"}"
