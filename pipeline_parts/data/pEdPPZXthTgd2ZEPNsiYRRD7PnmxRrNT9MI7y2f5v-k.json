We met Paris earlier this year when she did a deep-dive as a builder of DAOs and NFTs, including growing [internet cabbages](https://techoptimist.xyz/). We formed an instant connection, and more importantly, we found incredible alignment in each other’s values, principles, and approach to supporting and growing the crypto community.\\n\\nParis is a savvy investor and community builder who established herself as one of the leading thinkers and angel investors in crypto, particularly in the DeFi, social token, and NFT spaces. Before diving into crypto full-time, Paris worked at Slow Ventures, Medium, and about.me where she worked with founders, built communities, and helped grow companies. In 2016, she was recognized as a rising star on the [Forbes 30 Under 30](https://www.forbes.com/30-under-30-2016/marketing-advertising/#564e97a82c19) list.\\n\\n[IDEO CoLab Ventures](https://twitter.com/IDEOVC) is not your typical venture firm—we’re building a venture collective that embodies what makes crypto-networks special: openness, community, and collaboration. We pride ourselves on being active and hands-on participants in communities we believe in. For all of these reasons and more, Paris is an incredible addition to our team. \\n\\nParis will be focusing on our investments in the metaverse, NFTs, social tokens, and DeFi. Her mission is to back the next generation of world-class founders who are making Web3 and its superpowers accessible to new audiences around the world. Paris travels all over the world, but she will often be found in IDEO’s London studio.\\n\\nPlease join us in welcoming Paris to the IDEO CoLab Ventures family. She already represents the heart and soul of the organization and community we are aiming to build.\\n\\n> “The only way to make sense out of change is to plunge into it, move with it, and join the dance.” –Alan Watts\\n\\n*The winner of this NFT will receive a 2-hour design session with the IDEO CoLab Ventures team. All proceeds will be given to [SheFi](shefi.org), a DeFi education initiative for women.*\\n\\n[Token #3474](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3474)\",\"timestamp\":1623263324,\"title\":\"Paris Rouzati joins IDEO CoLab Ventures\",\"publication\":\"ideovc\"},\"digest\":\"ihRqxocsR5N5PZaY8lHlPdwPGwVIhtBDnqLwuLqva8E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA83444576F86C8B59A542eC2F286a19aB12c2666\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zMUBHSL3qAdTmW-NGK3DxaZ8EmQNRFkWFh2j1tKKNrU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"uCP5R5_pn6I1mkExaot2J3XArf3kLm5vchLAU-qXvvE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eW1gFnNkkK1AEZu78eYdabw6xfilADKzVWp21Kq2xwS6hb1gGvk27vnIJvXphkZJTU6BzATZIYQM-1gE91zkeQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a9131249e1b04d3e005e1327ed9bc34b5b20f1a5563992420cb8362727f1e031f3698be17b4935a2cb26603e0272d7de950c4ee6e9554a3fb3227b71b9df6761b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on paris.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zMUBHSL3qAdTmW-NGK3DxaZ8EmQNRFkWFh2j1tKKNrU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"uCP5R5_pn6I1mkExaot2J3XArf3kLm5vchLAU-qXvvE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{\"nftTransactionHash\":\"0x6329d61b1d83587196ba06b5626ffa1e0e793d02f6558884d84f4cfdcc8bef50\"},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Cnks5hBE5eKIlyXGRrxaCoKQJSYhS2pMxTYap57RJfc\"}"
