"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In China, people were deeply impressed by the \\\"sexual openness\\\" and \\\"sexual freedom\\\" of the United States. But there is little understanding of the other side of the United States.\\nTherefore, I would like to introduce you to some regulations on \\\"sexual harassment\\\" in the United States and understand the problem of \\\"sexual openness\\\" from this perspective.\\nThe prohibition of sexual harassment is also part of the civil rights law. If you work in an American company, especially some large companies, there are some strict codes of conduct in the workplace. When you see here, you may think that a very serious \\\"harassment action\\\" will be called \\\"sexual harassment\\\". In fact, it is not so.\\nI once read the rules and regulations of a large company. There are many provisions prohibiting \\\"sexual harassment\\\" in the workplace in accordance with the civil rights law. For example, it is not allowed to post nude photos in the workplace.\\nAmericans are very used to putting some private photos and decorations in their working environment. In general, the owner of the office will put all kinds of enlarged family photos, as well as all kinds of decorative paintings and photos they like. There are all kinds of things.\\nHowever, if you put a nude photo, it belongs to the scope of \\\"sexual harassment\\\". This rule is even so strict that if you put nude photos on the inside of your locker, it is prohibited. For another example, swearing in the workplace also belongs to the scope of \\\"sexual harassment\\\", even if it is a slip of the tongue.\\nThere are also clear boundaries for joking. The rules and regulations recognize that different genders have different feelings and understanding of a joke. Whether a \\\"joke\\\" belongs to \\\"sexual harassment\\\" is determined based on the feelings of the party listening to the \\\"joke\\\".\\nIn other words, when you are joking, no matter how \\\"indifferent\\\" you think it is, as long as the person listening to the joke thinks you are uncomfortable and that you are \\\"sexual harassment\\\", you can confirm that you are \\\"sexual harassment\\\".\\nThe requirements for managers are particularly strict. If you date and fall in love with the staff you manage, the company stipulates that one of them must be transferred to another department, and expressly warns that such a situation may affect the future of managers.\\nAt the same time, the system also has instructions on how to complain to a certain department and person in charge after the occurrence of \\\"sexual harassment\\\". The recipient is responsible for keeping it confidential and must give a reply to the investigation and handling within the specified number of days. However, if it has been brought to court, the company no longer has the responsibility of confidentiality.\\nA friend of mine operates on the assembly line of the factory. She told me what happened in her workshop. One day, when the work was very busy, the female workers were complaining about backache. A male administrator stood behind a female worker, and he pinched his shoulder for the female worker. Usually, this is just a friendly gesture. Afterwards, the administrator was asked by the supervisor to talk. He has been charged with \\\"sexual harassment\\\".\\nOf course, he argued for himself. The supervisor showed him the company's regulations. In terms of regulations, he suggested that all staff members \\\"do not touch\\\". Because \\\"unwilling contact\\\" is a very important crime of sexual harassment. In order to avoid this, simply \\\"not contact\\\" is the simplest. There are such problems not only between the opposite sex, but also between the same sex, because there are homosexuals in society. In fact, Americans are far more sensitive to \\\"contact\\\" than the Chinese.\",\"timestamp\":1641485504,\"title\":\"Linda: how open is America's \\\"sexual openness\\\"?
