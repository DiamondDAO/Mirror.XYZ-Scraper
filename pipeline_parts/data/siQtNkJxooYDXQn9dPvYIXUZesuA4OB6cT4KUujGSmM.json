"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Gift-giving is a habit. When a boss, you should give gifts habitually. As long as I go to any friend, to be a companion, to play at a stranger’s house, or to play at someone else’s company, I will give a gift, and buy some small toys, calligraphy and painting, antiques, and dolls on Taobao, which are very cheap. I have prepared a lot, as long as I go out, I will bring a gift based on the characteristics of the other party.\\n\\nFor example, if someone asks me to go out for a drink, if this person is useful to me, I will promise him, go out for a drink, and ask how many people, men and women, and then I will prepare a few gifts\\n\\nThing, bring it over. Everyone got my gift, so naturally they would toast me on the wine table. I will naturally become the focus.\\n\\nAnd my relationship with everyone will get better and better, whether it is an employee or a friend's family member.\\n\\nGiving gifts can make others remember you, so many things will become easier to handle. China is a relational society. To manage good relations, communication is very efficient and obstacles.\\n\\nJust less. Gifts should be given lightly. Don’t give this gift as if it’s very valuable.\\n\\nSon, in this way, others will have psychological pressure, and when there is psychological pressure, others will not be willing to accept or even play with you.\\n\\nFor example, a young girl who just graduated from college wanted to do internet with me the year before last. She gave me a gift of less than 200 yuan, and kept saying that my life is very difficult and I don't have much money. I spent one month's salary to give you a gift. You taught me how to earn 3W a month on the Internet. I will come back to give you good things when I make money. When I heard it, I got a big head. I just wanted to return the gift to her or buy it with the money. I thought, \\\"You take it quickly!\\\", and said: \\\"I can't do it, you still find a job. Well, stop thinking about it!\\\" I don't want to see such a person a second time. Why? Because of the psychological pressure she puts on people, the emotional pressure is too great. I accepted her gift and had to teach her a monthly income of 30,000 yuan. If I can't do it, this kind of person will generally yell at me, and it's better not to provoke me. Therefore, we compare our hearts to our hearts. When we give gifts to others, we must downplay them and do not put others under pressure.\\n\\nWhat does this show? In our Buddhist scriptures, it is said that \\\"the mind without abiding life, and giving without form.\\\" When giving something to others, don't put pressure on others, so that other people can easily accept it, and don't give back. In this way, people may help you from the bottom of their hearts. And if you ask for something, it's too late for others to hide.\\n\\nHowever, even though you give gifts lightly, Chinese people always pay attention to courtesy. In the future, you\\n\\nIf you want him to help, in fact, he is very happy. You used a very small cost to exchange a reserve staff who is willing to help you. It is a very worthwhile thing.\\n\\nThere used to be a story in a temple. Said that a man divorced his wife, gave up everything and became a monk. What about this monk,\\n\\nBe an assistant to the abbot. Often some big wealthy people gave the abbot some treasures and some red envelopes. This monk even opened the seal\\n\\nDon't take it apart, just put it away and give it to the abbot. Later other monks said to this assistant monk: \\\"If you take a little, anyway, there are so many good things, the abbot can't use it up!\\\". The monk said, \\\"What's the use of this? I'm all from the temple.\\\" Later, the abbot personally tested him and asked someone to give the monk a few pieces of gold to see if the monk wanted it! As a result, the monk still hadn't opened the package, so he threw it to the abbot. Later, the old abbot no longer worked, thinking left and right, he still felt that the assistant monk was the most reliable and would not exploit everyone. He passed the mantle directly to the assistant monk. The other monks are also assured that this assistant monk will be the abbot, and the entire temple belongs to him. Not asking for anything, but getting the most things. Of course, we are businessmen, and it is not profitable to get early, but on the surface, we must be waterproof.\",\"timestamp\":1634794710,\"title\":\"Be a boss, give gifts habitually and comprehend the art of gift giving\"},\"digest\":\"OiMP9cyp1rADxFE-Cq7xirTzC5m-cT4nZy72bz9jHU4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6fj6cPSxM4mB0mF5pC3FnOny8iXov6OMtsUsLDRyXGR8emPHJrjFSGQc8CaqLRDwDQvDjfENrX7IT-jajDhsMg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OiMP9cyp1rADxFE-Cq7xirTzC5m-cT4nZy72bz9jHU4\"}"
