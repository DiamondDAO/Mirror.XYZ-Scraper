"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The difference between the poor and the rich is the difference in thinking, what kind of thinking you are, you will have what kind of life; it is very simple to change people, not depending on how much education and background you have, but when you change from Your idea. If you go to university and still think of a migrant worker, then even if you are in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, you are just a migrant worker with a university diploma.\\n\\nWhat the poor lack: lack of funds on the surface, lack of ambition in their minds, lack of ideas in their minds, lack of courage in their bones, lack of action for change, lack of perseverance in their careers! In fact, you can't learn these things even if you read a lot of books, and success is not very much related to book knowledge. It has the biggest relationship with the points I mentioned at the beginning. You should train these things consciously.\\n\\nThe smartest person in the world borrows the bloodshed experience of others as his own experience. The stupidest person in the world uses his own head and bloodshed experience to be called experience! The smartest people in the world spend a lot of energy and money to observe the world. The poor only know to lower their heads to work.\\n\\nThe poor like to cling to the past and reject new ideas and challenges. Everyone has a day to retire, but not everyone can have post-retirement protection.\\n\\nSmart people continue to add value to their brains. Even when they are older, they can still make a lot of money. For example, Buffett did not lose his earning ability because of his age. On the contrary, these people who make money by their brains, the older they are. The more experience, the more money you make.\\n\\nDoing business does not lie in the length of time and the shortness of time, but in the morning and evening of the epiphany. Some brothers have been working for more than 10 years and only have hundreds of thousands of cash in hand, which is purely incapable of doing business and not knowing anything. Businessmen should reflect every day and strive to realize something, instead of focusing on day by day.\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 99\\n\\nThere is no change. The success or failure of life is often between one thought. Buddhism talks about kindness and protection. For example, we are angry.\\n\\nAnger beatings and quarrels can lead to serious consequences, and the cause may be trivial. The life-changing trajectory may be just associating with someone casually or reading a book. When you come into contact with me, you should be at the upper echelons of society in your entire life, because I will tell you some of my experience and experience every day.\\n\\nMany people say that being young is capital, but it is worthless if you don't work hard, and youth without struggle is of little significance. And to make money? In fact, it is not difficult, as long as you find a good project and die for two years, it is easy for millionaires and multimillionaires.\\n\\nThe most beautiful thing in the sky is the stars, moon, and Chang'e. The most beautiful thing in the world is the true feelings, such as love, the feelings between the parents, the feelings between the brothers, the feelings between the team, but if you don’t have money, love, your parents The feelings between each other, the feelings between colleagues, you probably don’t realize it. I have a cousin who is getting married. On January 1, shall I go? I won't go because I want to make money. My parents scolded my six relatives for not acknowledging them. In fact, it seemed that they were very affectionate. In fact, I was smiling bitterly in my heart. Many people were always so ignorant to maintain those meaningless feelings.\\n\\nWhat everyone can afford is always limited, but the possibility of winning is unlimited. For example, if you pay to join my VIP group, what you pay is only a few thousand dollars, and what you get is the spiritual companionship of my life. Many people are reluctant to bear this. For a few thousand dollars, he got nothing. In fact, just like when we find a girlfriend, what you pay is extremely limited, but you have a woman. People who are afraid of paying are always stupid. I have made my lifelong commitment to teach you courses. I have gained a lot of money. At the same time, I have gained a lot of knowledge, a lot of wisdom, and I have met with a lot of rich bosses. Those who are afraid of paying money and hard work are stupid people.\\n\\nPeople often use books to judge ignorant things; people often use the wrong push\\n\\n100 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nOn the right conclusion. Even if I became a lot of VIP students, they still criticized me for doing wrong. In fact, if a person is wrong, just look at his wallet. People with more money are more correct than those with less money. Money represents a person’s money. Comprehensive strength, if you don't have much money, then you are wrong. Even if it is tactically correct, it is also strategically wrong.\\n\\nInstead of defeating the enemy 10,000 times and competing with others, it is better to defeat yourself once, change one of your shortcomings, and strive to change one of your shortcomings every day.\\n\\nTo manage the team, to manage anyone, giving money is the bottom line, giving people the ability is the middle policy, and giving people the idea is the best policy.\\n\\nThe rich are the unsatisfied people who are constantly pursuing, Rockefeller said, do everything possible to get money, and then do everything possible to give alms. What is expensive is to be free from vulgarity. If you don't plan with everyone, and don't do what everyone does, it will naturally be expensive. Poverty is poor because you have little knowledge. A person is poor because you have little knowledge, no brains, outdated concepts, and cheap because you have no spine. People must have spine and do what they say and do something on their own. Don’t blame Others, as long as the problem cannot be solved, it will always be their own fault.\\n\\nIf you think you are possible, you can make millions, tens of millions, or hundreds of millions. You think you are impossible, and everything is impossible. When you put faith in yourself, you will always be full of strength.\\n\\nPeople who like to care about the present will lose the future. The rich rely on capital to make money, the poor rely on knowledge to get rich, and learn to change. We are not a role model for others in our entire life, but a reference for others. It is unfortunate for others to look down on you; it is even more unfortunate for others to look down on yourself.\\n\\nWe poor people want to stand up, there is no reason to talk about hard work; we poor people want to stand up, there is no reason to talk about interest. Keep doing work.\\n\\nThe wise create opportunities, the strong grasp the opportunity, the weak wait for the opportunity, even if the opportunity comes,\\n\\nEntrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs 101\\n\\nThe weak can't grasp it, because he is usually not prepared.\\n\\nI have been fighting for my future.\\n\\nIt is better to be laughed at for a while than to be laughed at for a lifetime.\\n\\nEat the bitterness that others can't, endure the anger that others can't bear, do what others can't do\\n\\nYou can enjoy everything that others cannot enjoy.\",\"timestamp\":1634795664,\"title\":\"The difference in thinking between the poor and the rich\"},\"digest\":\"JUCkeYN1PHy9l5b2J_jwA7dDjRmoklCd9dY7rdsUj_Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"p3oDNcvHVIbdAntxlc74z9NvEwnCujOPvKZjCWJS_POuEWBv27wK4x244Nq4oy3S7WqDQfKhXiQ5RnC0IM83wg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JUCkeYN1PHy9l5b2J_jwA7dDjRmoklCd9dY7rdsUj_Y\"}"
