"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[View the entire collection](https://opensea.io/collection/dame-self)\\n\\n[$SELF](https://dame.mirror.xyz/KHVDbIRgNJCVmEJYbS6T_cdCTfRDB4h0kL6PpLkD6t8) has been completed and each unique NFT is being distributed to the correct participant. If you missed out on the original project, or if you'd like an extra collectible, I've made an image that features all of the pieces in sequential order. You can mint one of these collectibles here on this post.\\n\\n$SELF was an experiment and a participatory art project. I wanted to see what would happen when relationships, self identity, and blockchain collided. Anyone could join for a minimum of 0.01 ETH. At the beginning, I had no idea what this project would blossom into.\\n\\nIn the end, I created 72 unique abstract pieces. Each one has different traits, qualities, and complexities. In some ways, they are reminiscent of the generative NFT projects that are popular in the space right now. The difference though is that each $SELF is human-generated. I made each one by hand.\\n\\nHalfway through the project, I took a snapshot of the participating wallets and analyzed the resulting data. I also [encoded an on-chain message](https://dame.mirror.xyz/5xbwbVzWcO8vQkEIGlMaUjXNM6UNM8labiN-5QkVCHM) that was sent to each participant. Almost half of the participants sent on-chain replies. All of these elements, including some off-chain interactions, influenced my perception and understanding of each $SELF, as well as its relation to my $SELFs.\\n\\nIf I’m honest, I didn’t like some of the $SELFs I created. Many of the pieces felt quite ugly or nonsensical at times. I struggled with this fact during the creation process but ultimately leaned into it, accepting it as a pure expression of the project’s conceptual roots.\\n\\nAfter all, $SELF hatred is real. As is $SELF love.\\n\\nSharing these final NFTs with you is a form of $SELF expression and an invitation into a deeper relationship with your own $SELFs, to each other, and to the blockchain.\\n\\nI hope they serve as reminders that we don’t just contain multitudes... we are multitudes.\\n\\n--- \\n\\nThank you to everyone who participated. We are forever tied together on-chain. [Follow along on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jacksondame) so you don't miss my next art project. It's going to be even more interesting than the last!\\n\\n[Self](crowdfund://0x972fBE58D550F17eD723Bc4bcEb60163d45E46c1?version=3&network=homestead&features=backers)\",\"timestamp\":1628305694,\"title\":\"$SELF Reflection\",\"publication\":\"dame\"},\"digest\":\"V6p_vGQgEMvcM_RM8lAFxLkQ8fN2525N6UHdyQEmRCM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3B3525F60eeea4a1eF554df5425912c2a532875D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JLBYTitWatUdHzCK9KQR-EaYEAFOvolokx7mvbPggfM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"14dShRnbBQv-tUn1q9TAR8RvhBAO8nCEe-zl5G-r1Es\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hnscmNGwyIoWdMzeVGA2RJAmVKk021bu7oQ43oUAayo88PuiN955sT3XRkuGeLJSsVnY1w87Xftu2AzHksutRg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x43270c329176c38ab85717263e0eea3bc26d6a170367b589126b9032a97532305293fd7057cc6ac274f5e39f8e2fc2e2ddadc0c3809771d63c2d020725193ed61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on dame.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JLBYTitWatUdHzCK9KQR-EaYEAFOvolokx7mvbPggfM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"14dShRnbBQv-tUn1q9TAR8RvhBAO8nCEe-zl5G-r1Es\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"o4V9Mcjm5pombjhCwqC-NmiGj4PEBNcxhtrd4bDRlfw\"}"
