"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"essay on alchemy, but, in virtue of the alchemists' belief in the mystical unity of all things, in the analogical or correspondential relationship of all parts of the universe to each other, the mystical and the phallic views of the origin of alchemy are complementary, not antagonistic. Indeed, the assumption that the metals are the symbols of man almost necessitates the working out of physiological as well as mystical analogies, and these two series of analogies are themselves connected, because the principle \\\"As above, so below\\\" was held to be true of man himself. We might, therefore, expect to find a more or less complete harmony between the two series of symbols, though, as a matter of fact, contradictions will be encountered when we come to consider points of detail. The undoubtable antiquity of the phallic element in alchemical doctrine precludes the idea that this element was an adventitious one, that it was in any sense an afterthought; notwithstanding, however, the evidence, as will, I hope, become apparent as we proceed, indicates that mystical ideas played a much more fundamental part in the genesis of alchemical doctrine than purely phallic ones--mystical interpretations fit alchemical processes and theories far better than do sexual interpretations; in fact, sex has to be interpreted somewhat mystically in order to work out the analogies fully and satisfactorily.\\n\\nAs concerns Greek alchemy, I shall content myself with a passage from a work *On the Sacred Art*, attributed to OLYMPIODORUS (sixth century A.D.), followed by some quotations from and references to the *Turba*.  In the former work it is stated on the authority of HORUS that \\\"The proper end of the whole art is to obtain the semen of the male secretly, seeing that all things are male and female. Hence \\\\[we read further\\\\] Horus says in a certain place: Join the male and the female, and you will find that which is sought; as a fact, without this process of re-union, nothing can succeed, for Nature charms Nature,\\\" *etc*.  The *Turba* insistently commands those who would succeed in the Art, to conjoin the male with the female,\\\\[1\\\\] and, in one place, the male is said to be lead and the female orpiment.\\\\[2\\\\] We also find the alchemical work symbolised by the growth of the embryo in the womb. \\\"Know,\\\" we are told, \\\". . . that out of the elect things nothing becomes useful without conjunction and regimen, because sperma is generated out of blood and desire. For the man mingling with the woman, the sperm is nourished by the humour of the womb, and by the moistening blood, and by heat, and when forty nights have elapsed the sperm is formed.... God has constituted that heat and blood for the nourishment of the sperm until the foetus is brought forth. So long as it is little, it is nourished with milk, and in proportion as the vital heat is maintained, the bones are strengthened. Thus it behoves you also to act in this Art.\\\"\\\\[3\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *Vide* pp.  60 92, 96 97, 134, 135 and elsewhere in Mr WAITE'S translation.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] *Ibid*., p.  57\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] *Ibid*., pp.  179-181 (second recension); *cf*.  pp.  103-104.\\n\\nThe use of the mystical symbols of death (putrefaction) and resurrection or rebirth to represent the consummation of the alchemical work, and that of the phallic symbols of the conjunction of the sexes and the development of the foetus, both of which we have found in the *Turba*, are current throughout the course of Latin alchemy. In *The Chymical Marriage of Christian Rosencreutz*, that extraordinary document of what is called \\\"Rosicrucianism\\\"--a symbolic romance of considerable ability, whoever its author was,\\\\[1\\\\]-- an attempt is made to weld the two sets of symbols--the one of marriage, the other of death and resurrection unto glory-- into one allegorical narrative; and it is to this fusion of seemingly disparate concepts that much of its fantasticality is due. Yet the concepts are not really disparate; for not only is the second birth like unto the first, and not only is the resurrection unto glory described as the Bridal Feast of the Lamb, but marriage is, in a manner, a form of death and rebirth. To justify this in a crude sense, I might say that, from the male standpoint at least, it is a giving of the life-substance to the beloved that life may be born anew and increase. But in a deeper sense it is, or rather should be, as an ideal, a mutual sacrifice of self for each other's good--a death of the self that it may arise with an enriched personality.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] See Mr WAITE'S *The Real History of the Rosicrucians* (1887) for translation and discussion as to origin and significance. The work was first published (in German) at Strassburg in 1616.\\n\\nIt is when we come to an examination of the ideas at the root of, and associated with, the alchemical concept of \\\"principles,\\\" that we find some difficulty in harmonising the two series of symbols-- the mystical and the phallic.  In one place in the *Turba* we are directed \\\"to take quicksilver, in which is the male potency or strength\\\";\\\\[2a\\\\] and this concept of mercury as male is quite in accord with the mystical origin I have assigned in the preceding excursion to the doctrine of the alchemical principles. I have shown, I think, that salt, sulphur, and mercury are the analogues *ex hypothesi* of the body, soul (affection and volition), and spirit (intelligence or understanding) in man; and the affections are invariably regarded as especially feminine, the understanding as especially masculine. But it seems that the more common opinion, amongst Latin alchemists at any rate, was that sulphur was male and mercury female. Writes BERNARD of TREVISAN:  \\\"For the Matter suffereth, and the Form acteth assimulating the Matter to itself, and according to this manner the Matter naturally thirsteth after a Form, as a Woman desireth an Husband, and a Vile thing a precious one, and an impure a pure one, so also *Argent-vive* coveteth a Sulphur, as that which should make perfect which is imperfect: So also a Body freely desireth a Spirit, whereby it may at length arrive at its perfection.\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\] At the same time, however, Mercury was regarded as containing in itself both male and female potencies-- it was the product of male and female, and, thus, the seed of all the metals.  \\\"Nothing in the World can be generated,\\\" to repeat a quotation from BERNARD, without these two Substances, to wit a Male and Female:  From whence it appeareth, that although these two substances are not of one and the same species, yet one Stone cloth thence arise, and although they appear and are said to be two Substances, yet in truth it is but one, to wit, *Argent-vive*. But of this *Argent-vive* a certain part is fixed and digested, Masculine, hot, dry and secretly informing. But the other, which is the Female, is volatile, crude, cold, and moyst.\\\"\\\\[2b\\\\] EDWARD KELLY (1555-1595), who is valuable because he summarises authoritative opinion, says somewhat the same thing, though in clearer words:  \\\"The active elements . . . these are water and fire . . . may be called male, while the passive elements . . . earth and air . . . represent the female principle.... Only two elements, water and earth, are visible, and earth is called the hiding-place of fire, water the abode of air. In these two elements we have the broad law of limitation which divides the male from the female.  . . . The first matter of minerals is a kind of viscous water, mingled with pure and impure earth. . . . Of this viscous water and fusible earth, or sulphur, is composed that which is called quicksilver, the first matter of the metals. Metals are nothing but Mercury digested by different degrees of heat.\\\"\\\\[1c\\\\] There is one difference, however, between these two writers, inasmuch as BERNARD says that \\\"the Male and Female abide together in closed Natures; the Female truly as it were Earth and Water, the Male as Air and Fire.\\\"  Mercury for him arises from the two former elements, sulphur from the two latter.\\\\[2c\\\\] And the difference is important as showing beyond question the *a priori* nature of alchemical reasoning.  The idea at the back of the alchemists' minds was undoubtedly that of the ardour of the male in the act of coition and the alleged, or perhaps I should say apparent, passivity of the female.  Consequently, sulphur, the fiery principle of combustion, and such elements as were reckoned to be active, were denominated \\\"male,\\\" whilst mercury, the principle acted on by sulphur, and such elements as were reckoned to be passive, were denominated \\\"female\\\". As to the question of origin, I do not think that the palm can be denied to the mystical as distinguished from the phallic theory.  And in its final form the doctrine of principles is incapable of a sexual interpretation. Mystically understood, man is capable of analysis into two principles-- since \\\"body\\\" may be neglected as unimportant (a false view, I think, by the way) or \\\"soul\\\" and \\\"spirit\\\" may be united under one head-- OR into three; whereas the postulation of THREE principles on a sexual basis is impossible.  JOANNES ISAACUS HOLLANDUS (fifteenth century) is the earliest author in whose works I have observed explicit mention of THREE principles, though he refers to them in a manner seeming to indicate that the doctrine was no new one in his day. I have only read one little tract of his; there is nothing sexual in it, and the author's mental character may be judged from his remarks concerning \\\"the three flying spirits\\\"--taste, smell, and colour. These, he writes, \\\"are the life, soule, and quintessence of every thing, neither can these three spirits be one without the other, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are one, yet three Persons, and one is not without the other.\\\"\\\\[1d\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[2a\\\\] Mr WAITE's translation, p.  79.\\n\\n\\\\[1b\\\\] BERNARD, Earl of TREVISAN:  *A Treatise of the Philosopher's Stone*, 1683.

By their union metals were thought to be produced in the womb of the earth; and mines were shut in order that by the birth and growth of new metal the impoverished veins might be replenished. In this way, too, was the *magnum opus*, the generation of the Philosopher's Stone--in species gold, but purer than the purest-- to be accomplished.  To conjoin that which Nature supplied, to foster the growth and development of that which was thereby produced; such was the task of the alchemist.  \\\"For there are Vegetables,\\\" says BERNARD of TREVISAN in his *Answer to Thomas of Bononia*, \\\"but Sensitives more especially, which for the most part beget their like, by the Seeds of the Male and Female for the most part concurring and conmixt by copulation; which work of Nature the Philosophick Art imitates in the generation of gold.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *Op.  cit*., p.  216.\\n\\nMercury, as I have said, was commonly regarded as the seed of the metals, or as especially the female seed, there being two seeds, one the male, according to BERNARD, more ripe, perfect and active, the other the female. \\\"more immature and in a sort passive\\\\[2\\\\] \\\". . . our Philosophick Art,\\\" he says in another place, following a description of the generation of man, \\\" . . . is like this procreation of Man; for as in *Mercury* (of which Gold is by Nature generated in Mineral Vessels) a natural conjunction\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] *Ibid*., p.  217; *cf*.  p.  236 is made of both the Seeds, Male and Female, so by our artifice, an artificial and like conjunction is made of Agents and Patients.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] \\\"All teaching,\\\" says KELLY, \\\"that changes Mercury is false and vain, for this is the original sperm of metals, and its moisture must not be dried up, for otherwise it will not dissolve,\\\"\\\\[2\\\\] and quotes ARNOLD (*ob. c*.  1310) to a similar effect.\\\\[3\\\\] One wonders how far the fact that human and animal seed is fluid influenced the alchemists in their choice of mercury, the only metal liquid at ordinary temperatures, as the seed of the metals. There are, indeed, other good reasons for this choice, but that this idea played some part in it, and, at least, was present at the back of the alchemists' minds, I have little doubt.\\n\\nThe most philosophic account of metallic seed is that, perhaps, of the mysterious adept \\\"EIRENAEUS PHILALETHES,\\\" who distinguishes between it and mercury in a rather interesting manner. He writes:  \\\"Seed is the means of generic propagation given to all perfect things here below; it is the perfection of each body; and anybody that has no seed must be regarded as imperfect. Hence there can be no doubt that there is such a thing as metallic seed.... All metallic seed is the seed of gold; for gold is the intention of Nature in regard to all metals. If the base metals are not gold, it is only through some accidental hindrance; they are-all potentially gold. But, of course, this seed of gold is most easily obtainable from well-matured gold itself.... Remember that I am now speaking of metallic seed, and not of Mercury.... The seed of metals is hidden out of sight still more completely than that of animals; nevertheless, it is within the compass of our Art to extract it. The seed of animals and vegetables is something separate, and may be cut out, or otherwise separately exhibited; but metallic seed is diffused throughout the metal, and contained in all its smallest parts; neither can it be discerned from its body: its extraction is therefore a task which may well tax the ingenuity of the most experienced philosopher; the virtues of the whole metal have to be intensified, so as to convert it into the sperm of our seed, which, by circulation, receives the virtues of superiors and inferiors, then next becomes wholly form, or heavenly virtue, which can communicate this to others related to it by homogeneity of matter.  . . . The place in which the seed resides is-- approximately speaking--water; for, to speak properly and exactly, the seed is the smallest part of the metal, and is invisible; but as this invisible presence is diffused throughout the water of its kind, and exerts its virtue therein, nothing being visible to the eye but water, we are left to conclude from rational induction that this inward agent (which is, properly speaking, the seed) is really there. Hence we call the whole of the water seed, just as we call the whole of the grain seed, though the germ of life is only a smallest particle of the grain.\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *The Answer of* BERNARDUS TREVISANUS, *etc*.  *Op.  cit*.  p.  218.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] *op.  cit*., p.  22.\\n\\n\\\\[3\\\\] *Ibid*., p.  16.\\n\\n\\\\[1b\\\\] EIRENAEUS PHILALETHES:  *The Metamorphosis of Metals*. (See *The Hermetic Museum*, vol.  ii.  pp.  238-240.)\\n\\nTo say that \\\"PHILALETHES' \\\" seed resembles the modern electron is, perhaps, to draw a rather fanciful analogy, since the electron is a very precise idea, the result of the mathematical interpretation of the results of exact experimentation.  But though it would be absurd to speak of this concept of the one seed of all metals as an anticipation of the electron, to apply the expression \\\"metallic seed\\\" to the electron, now that the concept of it has been reached, does not seem so absurd.\\n\\nAccording to \\\"PHILALETHES,\\\" the extraction of the seed is a very difficult process, accomplishable, however, by the aid of mercury--the water homogeneous therewith. Mercury, again, is the form of the seed thereby obtained. He writes:  \\\"When the sperm hidden in the body of gold is brought out by means of our Art, it appears under the form of Mercury, whence it is exalted into the quintessence which is first white, and then, by means of continuous coction, becomes red.\\\"  And again: \\\"There is a womb into which the gold (if placed therein) will, of its own accord, emit its seed, until it is debilitated and dies, and by its death is renewed into a most glorious King, who thenceforward receives power to deliver all his brethren from the fear of death.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] EIRENAEUS PHILALETHES:  *The Metamorphosis of Metals*. (See *The Hermetic Museum*, vol.  ii.  pp.  241 and 244.)\\n\\nThe fifteenth-century alchemist THOMAS NORTON was peculiar in his views, inasmuch as he denied that metals have seed. He writes:  \\\"Nature never multiplies anything, except in either one or the other of these two ways:  either by decay, which we call putrefaction, or, in the case of animate creatures, by propagation.  In the case of metals there can be no propagation, though our Stone exhibits something like it.... Nothing can be multiplied by inward action unless it belong to the vegetable kingdom, or the family of sensitive creatures. But the metals are elementary objects, and possess neither seed nor sensation.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] THOMAS NORTON:  *The Ordinal of Alchemy*.  (See *The Hermetic Museum*, vol.  ii.  pp.  15 and 16.)\\n\\nHis theory of the origin of the metals is astral rather than phallic. \\\"The only efficient cause of metals,\\\" he says, \\\"is the mineral virtue, which is not found in every kind of earth, but only in certain places and chosen mines, into which the celestial sphere pours its rays in a straight direction year by year, and according to the arrangement of the metallic substance in these places, this or that metal is gradually formed.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] *Ibid*., pp.  15 and 16.\\n\\nIn view of the astrological symbolism of these metals, that gold should be masculine, silver feminine, does not surprise us, because the idea of the masculinity of the sun and the femininity of the moon is a bit of phallicism that still remains with us. It was by the marriage of gold and silver that very many alchemists considered that the *magnum opus* was to be achieved. Writes BERNARD of TREVISAN:  \\\"The subject of this admired Science \\\\[alchemy\\\\] is *Sol* and *Luna*, or rather Male and Female, the Male is hot and dry, the Female cold and moyst.\\\" The aim of the work, he tells us, is the extraction of the spirit of gold, which alone can enter into bodies and tinge them. Both *Sol* and *Luna* are absolutely necessary, and \\\"whoever . . . shall think that a Tincture can be made without these two Bodyes, . . . he proceedeth to the Practice like one that is blind.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] BERNARD, Earl of TREVISAN:  *A Treatise, etc., Op.  cit*.  pp.  83 and 87.\\n\\nKELLY has teaching to the same effect, the Mercury of the Philosophers being for him the menstruum or medium wherein the copulation of Gold with Silver is to be accomplished. Mercury, in fact, seems to have been everything and to have been capable of effecting everything in the eyes of the alchemists.  Concerning gold and silver, KELLY writes: \\\"Only one metal, viz.  gold, is absolutely perfect and mature. Hence it is called the perfect male body. . . Silver is less bounded by aqueous immaturity than the rest of the metals, though it may indeed be regarded as to a certain extent impure, still its water is already covered with the congealing vesture of its earth, and it thus tends to perfection. This condition is the reason why silver is everywhere called by the Sages the perfect female body.\\\"  And later he writes: \\\"In short, our whole Magistery consists in the union of the male and female, or active and passive, elements through the mediation of our metallic water and a proper degree of heat.  Now, the male and female are two metallic bodies, and this I will again prove by irrefragable quotations from the Sages.\\\"  Some of the quotations will be given:  \\\"Avicenna:  `Purify husband and wife separately, in order that they may unite more intimately; for if you do not purify them, they cannot love each other.  By conjunction of the two natures you get a clear and lucid nature, which, when it ascends, becomes bright and serviceable.' . . . Senior:  `I, the Sun, am hot and dry, and thou, the Moon, are cold and moist; when we are wedded together in a closed chamber, I will gently steal away thy soul.' . . . Rosinus:  `When the Sun, my brother, for the love of me (silver) pours his sperm (_i.e_. his solar fatness) into the chamber (_i.e_. my Lunar body), namely, when we become one in a strong and complete complexion and union, the child of our wedded love will be born.' . . . `Rosary': `The ferment of the Sun is the sperm of the man, the ferment of the Moon, the sperm of the woman.  Of both we get a chaste union and a true generation.' . . . Aristotle:  `Take your beloved son, and wed him to his sister, his white sister, in equal marriage, and give them the cup of love, for it is a food which prompts to union.'  \\\"\\\\[1a\\\\] KELLY, of course, accepts the traditional authorship of the works from which he quotes, though in many cases such authorship is doubtful, to say the least.  The alchemical works ascribed to ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C.), for instance, are beyond question forgeries. Indeed, the symbol of a union between brother and sister, here quoted, could hardly be held as acceptable to Greek thought, to which incest was the most abominable and unforgiveable sin. It seems likelier that it originated with the Egyptians, to whom such unions were tolerable in fact.  The symbol is often met with in Latin alchemy.  MICHAEL MAIER (1568-1622) also says: \\\"*conjunge fratrem cum sorore et propina illis poculum amoris*,\\\" the words forming a motto to a picture of a man and woman clasped in each other's arms, to whom an older man offers a goblet. This symbolic picture occurs in his *Atalanta Fugiens, hoc est, Emblemata nova de Secretis Naturae Chymica, etc*. (Oppenheim, 1617). This work is an exceedingly curious one. It consists of a number of carefully executed pictures, each accompanied by a motto, a verse of poetry set to music, with a prose text.  Many of the pictures are phallic in conception, and practically all of them are anthropomorphic.  Not only the primary function of sex, but especially its secondary one of lactation, is made use of.  The most curious of these emblematic pictures, perhaps, is one symbolising the conjunction of gold and silver. It shows on the right a man and woman, representing the sun and moon, in the act of coition, standing up to the thighs in a lake. On the left, on a hill above the lake, a woman (with the moon as halo) gives birth to a child.  A boy is coming out of the water towards her.  The verse informs us that:  \\\"The bath glows red at the conception of the boy, the air at his birth.\\\" We learn also that \\\"there is a stone, and yet there is not, which is the noble gift of God.  If God grants it, fortunate will be he who shall receive it.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1a\\\\] EDWARD KELLY:  *The Stone of the Philosophers, Op. cit*., pp 13, 14, 33, 35, 36, 38-40, and 47.\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *Op.  Cit*., p.  145\\n\\nConcerning the nature of gold, there is a discussion in *The Answer of* BERNARDUS TREVISANUS *to the Epistle of Thomas of Bononia*, with which I shall close my consideration of the present aspect of the subject. Its interest for us lies in the arguments which are used and held to be valid.  \\\"Besides, you say that Gold, as most think, is nothing else than *Quick-silver* coagulated naturally by the force of *Sulphur*; yet so, that nothing of the *Sulphur* which generated the Gold, cloth remain in the substance of the Gold:  as in an humane *Embryo*, when it is conceived in the Womb, there remains nothing of the Father's Seed, according to *Aristotle's* opinion, but the Seed of the Man cloth only coagulate the *menstrual* blood of the Woman: in the same manner you say, that after *Quick-silver* is so coagulated, the form of Gold is perfected in it, by virtue of the Heavenly Bodies, and especially of the Sun.\\\\[1\\\\] BERNARD, however, decides against this view, holding that gold contains both mercury and sulphur, for \\\"we must not imagine, according to their mistake who say, that the Male Agent himself approaches the Female in the coagulation, and departs afterwards; because, as is known in every generation, the conception is active and passive: Both the active and the passive, that is, all the four Elements, must always abide together, otherwise there would be no mixture, and the hope of generating an off-spring would be extinguished.\\\"\\\\[2\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1\\\\] *Op.  cit*., pp.  206 and 207.\\n\\n\\\\[2\\\\] *Ibid*., pp.  212 and 213.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I wish to say something of the role of sex in spiritual alchemy.  But in doing this I am venturing outside the original field of inquiry of this essay and making a by no means necessary addition to my thesis; and I am anxious that what follows should be understood as such, so that no confusion as to the issues may arise.\\n\\nIn the great alchemical collection of J. J. MANGET, there is a curious work (originally published in 1677), entitled *Mutus Liber*, which consists entirely of plates, without letterpress. Its interest for us in our present concern is that the alchemist, from the commencement of the work until its achievement, is shown working in conjunction with a woman.  We are reminded of NICOLAS FLAMEL (1330-1418), who is reputed to have achieved the *magnum opus* together with his wife PERNELLE, as well as of the many other women workers in the Art of whom we read.  It would be of interest in this connection to know exactly what association of ideas was present in the mind of MICHAEL MAIER when he commanded the alchemist: \\\"Perform a work of women on the molten white lead, that is, cook,\\\"\\\\[1a\\\\] and illustrated his behest with a picture of a pregnant woman watching a fire over which is suspended a cauldron and on which are three jars. There is a cat in the background, and a tub containing two fish in the foreground, the whole forming a very curious collection of emblems. Mr WAITE, who has dealt with some of these matters, luminously, though briefly, says:  \\\"The evidences with which we have been dealing concern solely the physical work of alchemy and there is nothing of its mystical aspects.  The *Mutus Liber* is undoubtedly on the literal side of metallic transmutation; the memorials of Nicholas Flamel are also on that side,\\\" *etc*.  He adds, however, that \\\"It is on record that an unknown master testified to his possession of the mystery, but he added that he had not proceeded to the work because he had failed to meet with an elect woman who was necessary thereto\\\"; and proceeds to say:  \\\"I suppose that the statement will awaken in most minds only a vague sense of wonder, and I can merely indicate in a few general words that which I see behind it. Those Hermetic texts which bear a spiritual interpretation and are as if a record of spiritual experience present, like the literature of physical alchemy, the following aspects of symbolism: (*a*) the marriage of sun and moon; (*b*) of a mystical king and queen; (*c*) an union between natures which are one at the root but diverse in manifestation; (*d*) a transmutation which follows this union and an abiding glory therein.  It is ever a conjunction between male and female in a mystical sense; it is ever the bringing together by art of things separated by an imperfect order of things; it is ever the perfection of natures by means of this conjunction. But if the mystical work of alchemy is an inward work in consciousness, then the union between male and female is an union in consciousness; and if we remember the traditions of a state when male and female had not as yet been divided, it may dawn upon us that the higher alchemy was a practice for the return into this ineffable mode of being. The traditional doctrine is set forth in the *Zohar* and it is found in writers like Jacob Boehme; it is intimated in the early chapters of Genesis and, according to an apocryphal saying of Christ, the kingdom of heaven will be manifested when two shall be as one, or when that state has been once again attained.  In the light of this construction we can understand why the mystical adept went in search of a wise woman with whom the work could be performed; but few there be that find her, and he confessed to his own failure. The part of woman in the physical practice of alchemy is like a reflection at a distance of this more exalted process, and there is evidence that those who worked in metals and sought for a material elixir knew that there were other and greater aspects of the Hermetic mystery.\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[1a\\\\] MICHAEL MATER:  *Atalanta Fugiens* (1617), p.  97.\\n\\n\\\\[1b\\\\] A E. WAITE:  \\\"Woman and the Hermetic Mystery,\\\" *The Occult Review* (June 1912), vol.  xv.  pp.  325 and 326.\\n\\nSo far Mr WAITE, whose impressive words I have quoted at some length; and he has given us a fuller account of the theory as found in the *Zohar* in his valuable work on *The Secret Doctrine in Israel* (1913). The *Zohar* regards marriage and the performance of the sexual function in marriage as of supreme importance, and this not merely because marriage symbolises a divine union, unless that expression is held to include all that logically follows from the fact, but because, as it seems, the sexual act in marriage may, in fact, become a ritual of transcendental magic.\\n\\nAt least three varieties of opinion can be traced from the view of sex we have under consideration, as to the nature of the perfect man, and hence of the most adequate symbol for transmutation. According to one, and this appears to have been JACOB BOEHME'S view, the perfect man is conceived of as non-sexual, the male and female elements united in him having, as it were, neutralised each other. According to another, he is pictured as a hermaphroditic being, a concept we frequently come across in alchemical literature. It plays a prominent part in MAIER'S book *Atalanta Fugiens*, to which reference has already been made.  MAIER'S hermaphrodite has two heads, one male, one female, but only one body, one pair of arms, and one pair of legs.  The two sexual organs, which are placed side by side, are delineated in the illustrations with considerable care, showing the importance MAIER attached to the idea. This concept seems to me not only crude, but unnatural and repellent. But it may be said of both the opinions I have mentioned, that they confuse between union and identity.  It is the old mistake, with respect to a lesser goal, of those who hope for absorption in the Divine Nature and consequent loss of personality. It seems to be forgotten that a certain degree of distinction is necessary to the joy of union.  \\\"Distinction\\\" and \\\"separation,\\\" it should be remembered, have different connotations.  If the supreme joy is that of self-sacrifice, then the self must be such that it can be continually sacrificed, else the joy is a purely transitory one, or rather, is destroyed at the moment of its consummation. Hence, though sacrificed, the self must still remain itself.\\n\\nThe third view of perfection, to which these remarks naturally lead, is that which sees it typified in marriage.  The mystic-philosopher SWEDENBORG has some exceedingly suggestive things to say on the matter in his extraordinary work on *Conjugial Love*, which, curiously enough, seem largely to have escaped the notice of students of these high mysteries.\\n\\nSWEDENBORG'S heaven is a sexual heaven, because for him sex is primarily a spiritual fact, and only secondarily, and because of what it is primarily, a physical fact; and salvation is hardly possible, according to him, apart from a genuine marriage (whether achieved here or hereafter). Man and woman are considered as complementary beings, and it is only through the union of one man with one woman that the perfect angel results. The altruistic tendency of such a theory as contrasted with the egotism of one in which perfection is regarded as obtainable by each personality of itself alone, is a point worth emphasising. As to the nature of this union, it is, to use SWEDENBORG'S own terms, a conjunction of the will of the wife with the understanding of the man, and reciprocally of the understanding of the man with the will of the wife. It is thus a manifestation of that fundamental marriage between the good and the true which is at the root of all existence; and it is because of this fundamental marriage that all men and women are born into the desire to complete themselves by conjunction. The symbol of sexual intercourse is a legitimate one to use in speaking of this heavenly union; indeed, we may describe the highest bliss attainable by the soul, or conceivable by the mind, as a spiritual orgasm. Into conjugal love \\\"are collected,\\\" says SWEDENBORG, \\\"all the blessednesses, blissfulnesses, delightsomenesses, pleasantnesses, and pleasures, which could possibly be conferred upon man by the Lord the Creator.\\\"\\\\[1\\\\] In another place he writes: \\\"Married partners \\\\[in heaven\\\\] enjoy similar intercourse with each other as in the world, but more delightful and blessed; yet without prolification, for which, or in place of which, they have spiritual prolification, which is that of love and wisdom.\\\" \\\"The reason,\\\" he adds, \\\"why the intercourse then is more delightful and blessed is, that when conjugial love becomes of the spirit, it becomes more interior and pure, and consequently more perceptible; and every delightsomeness grows according to the perception, and grows even until its blessedness is discernible in its delightsomeness.\\\"\\\\[1b\\\\] Such love, however, he says, is rarely to be found on earth.\",\"timestamp\":1641298364,\"title\":\"\\nIn aiming to establish this, I may be thought to be endeavouring to establish a counter-thesis to that of the preceding\"},\"digest\":\"5QPkT7smQshYlWBZXynfjlvJRuPbN1Jd1fGjmpDVdx4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBD285526750c6d1e9c301005d31Fcad2bE9E9AA0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_OhyN5rnM7tDJ2b2aNHdqLl_VoMGhTzZ8EyC-dtdMYA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Hr6PSJmm7W5CWcHGSbl0NjZj4uW5lODSvSRVmLLDeoM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xtLlTHlIrXmSHDu44IiL98axsKoE_VJnS7FCApepEgnowP80A9niIWvdaM1E1FK8xYeg_lHLKuD580Rno7OpqA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6a1776f948ea61135e69d9ff3f0ae53b0e72eca0fc96d1dbb4e2425c1fe63eaa532bc09eaf163d07b43912644df009b2889d8dcb43fa4a97458b90dcbc7cc4341b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_OhyN5rnM7tDJ2b2aNHdqLl_VoMGhTzZ8EyC-dtdMYA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Hr6PSJmm7W5CWcHGSbl0NjZj4uW5lODSvSRVmLLDeoM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5QPkT7smQshYlWBZXynfjlvJRuPbN1Jd1fGjmpDVdx4\"}"
