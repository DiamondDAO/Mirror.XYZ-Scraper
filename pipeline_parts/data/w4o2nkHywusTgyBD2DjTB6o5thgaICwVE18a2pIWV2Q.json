"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"After what seemed like my 100th job rejection email, I was completely fed up. Many hours were spent refining applications & reviewing my CV all for the inevitable: â€˜Unfortunately, you have been unsuccessful on this occasion, now please piss off.â€™\\n\\nIn a bleak job market, I prioritized seeking guidance. Mentors, career advisors, and lecturers all provided useful advice which I followed religiously. But the outcome remained the same.\\n\\nI decided that I HAD to do something different to stand out. And this was cold emailing. This low-stakes high reward tool has changed my life. I have made friends, gained mentorship, and have been offered an internship through cold emails. Whether you are a student searching for your first job or a working professional trying to pivot career paths, I believe there are **three reasons** why cold emailing could be a game-changer.\\n\\n#### Improve persuasive writingÂ \\n\\nPersuasion and sales are important in every facet of life. Do you own a business?Â  You are persuading customers to choose your service or product over competitors.Â  Got an interview coming up? You are convincing the interviewer that you are a competent, hardworking, and a trustworthy worker worthy of the vacancy.Â \\n\\nTherefore, writing cold emails provides a platform to learn how to sell yourself.Â  Whether through experimentation or learning from the mistakes of others, you will quickly understand how to capture peopleâ€™s attention. Remember,Â  it is likely that youâ€™ll only get one chance to make an impression on the recipient - so make it count!\\n\\n#### Building new relationships\\n\\nWhy building relationships online is important? The internet provides you with the opportunity to connect with interesting people all over the world. Barriers in a pre-internet world have now been removed. Take advantage of this!Â \\n\\n#### Opportunities not open to the publicÂ \\n\\nA rule of thumb to consider - give more than you take. Ideally, start with value. Can you conduct an audit of their website or rewrite something for them? Personally, IÂ  wouldnâ€™t cold email a stranger with a huge request. Start with minor asks. Make the request as frictionless as possible .e.g. â€˜Would love brief feedback on my project attached belowâ€™.\\n\\nGo in with the mindset of building a strong relationship and the rest will follow. Who knows, you could get a job/internship if you play your cards right.\\n\\nNow that you understand how powerful reaching out can be, check out the following link on how to write a cold email:Â \\n\\n[Sriram Krishnan - 'How to write a cold email' - Article](https://sriramk.com/coldemail)\\n\\n[Auren Hoffman - 'How To Write a Great Cold Email That Will Actually Get a Response' - Article](https://summation.net/2020/05/04/how-to-write-a-great-cold-email-that-will-actually-get-a-response/?utm_source=pocket_mylist)\\n\\n[Alexey Guzey - 'Follow Up' - Article](https://guzey.com/follow-up/)\\n\\n[Timothy Armoo - 'Writing to get attention' - Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/TimArmoo/status/1406712388456529922)\\n\\n[Peak Frameworks - 'Cold Emailing - (The Best Skill to Get a Job) - Video](https://youtu.be/RAb3WttxM4o)\\n\\nThanks for reading!\\n\\nJerryðŸ’«\",\"timestamp\":1633725726,\"title\":\"The Power of Reaching Out : Cold EmailingðŸ“§\"},\"digest\":\"Bl7-ioGlg-OxZeJ6HSwXkrc1cjU6OpHbzpjQL5dysa4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x08eC91fF3B0036c7A62C31E3b2Fd73bA6B217a35\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SKscHiZADGu6nS7p3m_AFlBbe-IAAiJOEGRYUNLjMM0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A4O2SitcyFzHgS5irshe4U-z7FnCEg9NAP7jjo2zaSw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"mmYNutxmQWw_7PxbdvYJidAtuSxnGMRT9iUNJy_lUqsigAnkgj67XP9GWt-AKorw9gtVW_j9aQ5udz3XHsO-4A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x64e8f088ff5983806b91ccae1eb01f330ff8dfb9f3fa389a92d3289a1ab70d425b6e1636934783214a85e78585ab8e76c3df50fd5febaa51158fb405e891a4ed1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SKscHiZADGu6nS7p3m_AFlBbe-IAAiJOEGRYUNLjMM0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A4O2SitcyFzHgS5irshe4U-z7FnCEg9NAP7jjo2zaSw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Bl7-ioGlg-OxZeJ6HSwXkrc1cjU6OpHbzpjQL5dysa4\"}"
