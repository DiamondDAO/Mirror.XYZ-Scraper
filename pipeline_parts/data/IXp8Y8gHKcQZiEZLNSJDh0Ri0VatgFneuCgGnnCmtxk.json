"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"At last came the Gazette filled with the details of the killed and wounded.  Many a heart was broken, many a fireside was made desolate. It was indeed a sad time.  The terrible anxiety that pervaded so many families; the dreadful sacrifice of lives on so many battlefields; and the enormously increased taxation, which caused so many families to stint themselves to even the barest necessaries of life;--such was the inglorious side of war.\\n\\nBut there was also the glory, which almost compensated for the sorrow. I cannot resist narrating the entry of the Forty-second Regiment into Edinburgh shortly after the battle of Waterloo.  The old \\\"Black Watch\\\" is a regiment dear to every Scottish heart.  It has fought and struggled when resistance was almost certain death.  At Quatre Bras two flank companies were cut to pieces by Pire's cavalry.  The rest of the regiment was assailed by Reille's furious cannonade, and suffered severely.  The French were beaten back, and the remnant of the Forty-second retired to Waterloo, where they formed part of the brigade under Major-General Pack.  At the first grand charge of the French, Picton fell and many were killed.  Then the charge of the Greys took place, and the Highland regiments rushed forward, with cries of \\\"Scotland for ever!\\\"  Only a remnant of the Forty-second survived. They were however recruited, and marched into France with the rest of the army.\\n\\nTowards the end of the year the Forty-Second returned to England, and in the beginning of 1816 they set out on their march towards Edinburgh.  They were everywhere welcomed with enthusiasm.  Crowds turned out to meet them and cheer them.  When the first division of the regiment approached Edinburgh, almost the entire population turned out to welcome them.  At Musselburgh, six miles off; the road was thronged with people.  When the soldiers reached Piershill, two miles off, the road was so crowded that it took them two hours to reach the Castle. I was on a balcony in the upper part of the High Street, and my father, mother, and sisters were with me.  We had waited very long; but at last we heard the distant sound of the cheers, which came on and on, louder and louder.\\n\\nThe High Street was wedged with people excited and anxious. There seemed scarcely room for a regiment to march through them. The house-tops and windows were crowded with spectators.  It was a grand sight.  The high-gabled houses reaching as far as the eye could see, St. Giles' with its mural crown, the Tron Kirk in the distance, and the picturesque details of the buildings, all added to the effectiveness of the scene.\\n\\nAt last the head of the gallant band appeared.  The red coats gradually wedged their way through the crowd, amidst the ringing of bells and the cheers of the spectators.  Every window was in a wave of gladness, and every house-top was in a fever of excitement.  As the red line passed our balcony, with Colonel Dick at its head, we saw a sight that can never be forgotten.  The red-and-white plumes, the tattered colours riddled with bullets, the glittering bayonets, were seen amidst the crowd that thronged round the gallant heroes, amidst tears and cheers and hand-shakings and shouts of excitement.  The mass of men appeared like a solid body moving slowly along; the soldiers being almost hidden amongst the crowd.  At last they passed, the pipers and drums playing a Highland march; and the Forty-Second slowly entered the Castle.  It was perhaps the most extraordinary scene ever witnessed in Edinburgh.\\n\\nOne of my greatest enjoyments when a child was in going out with the servants to the Calton, and wait while the \\\"claes\\\" bleached in the sun on the grassy slopes of the hill.  The air was bright and fresh and pure.  The lasses regarded these occasions as a sort of holiday. One or two of the children usually accompanied them.  They sat together, and the servants told us their auld-warld stories; common enough in those days, but which have now, in a measure, been forgotten. \\\"Steam\\\" and \\\"progress\\\" have made the world much less youthful and joyous than it was then.\\n\\nThe women brought their work and their needles with them, and when they had told their stories, the children ran about the hill making bunches of wild flowers--including harebells and wild thyme.  They ran after the butterflies and the bumbees, and made acquaintance in a small way with the beauties of nature.  Then the servants opened their baskets of provisions, and we had a delightful picnic.  Though I am now writing about seventy years after the date of these events, I can almost believe that I am enjoying the delightful perfume of the wild thyme and the fragrant plants and flowers, wafted around me by the warm breezes of the Calton hillside.\\n\\nIn the days I refer to, there was always a most cheerful and intimate intercourse kept up between the children and the servants.  They were members of the same family, and were treated as such.  The servants were for the most part country-bred--daughters of farm servants or small farmers.  They were fairly educated at their parish schools; they could read and write, and had an abundant store of old recollections.  Many a pleasant crack we had with them as to their native places, their families, and all that was connected with them. They became lastingly attached to their masters and mistresses, as well as to the children.  All this led to true attachment; and when they left; us, for the most part to be married we continued to keep up a correspondence with them, which lasted for many years.\\n\\nWhile enjoying these delightful holidays, before my school-days began, my practical education was in progress, especially in the way of acquaintance with the habits of nature in a vast variety of its phases, always so attractive to the minds of healthy children.  It happened that close to the Calton Hill, in the valley at its northern side, there were many workshops where interesting trades were carried on; there were coppersmiths, tinsmiths, brass-founders, goldbeaters, and blacksmiths.  Their shops were all arranged in a busy group at the foot of the hill, in a place called Greenside.  The workshops were open to the inspection of passers-by.  Little boys looked in and saw the men at work amidst the blaze of fires and the beatings of hammers.\\n\\nAmongst others, I was an ardent admirer.  I may almost say that this row of busy workshops was my first school of practical education. I observed the mechanical manipulation of the men, their dexterous use of the hammer, the chisel, and the file; and I imbibed many lessons which afterwards proved of use to me.  Then I had tools at home in my father's workshop.  I tried to follow their methods; I became greatly interested in the use of tools and their appliances; I could make things for myself.  In short, I became so skilled that the people about the house called me \\\"a little Jack-of-all-trades.\\\"\\n\\nWhile sitting on the grassy slopes of the Calton Hill I would often hear the chimes sounding from the grand old tower of St.Giles. The cathedral lay on the other side of the valley which divides the Old Town from the New.  The sounds came over the murmur of the traffic in the streets below.\\n\\nThe chime-bells were played every day from twelve till one--the old-fashioned dinner-hour of the citizens.  The practice had been in existence for more than a hundred and fifty years.  The pleasing effect of the merry airs, which came wafted tome by the warm summer breezes, made me long to see them as well as hear them.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Mural crown of St Giles', Edinburgh\\n\\nMy father was always anxious to give pleasure to his children. Accordingly, he took me one day, as a special treat, to the top of the grand old tower, to see the chimes played.  As we passed up the tower, a strong vaulted room was pointed out to me, where the witches used to be imprisoned.  I was told that the poor old women were often taken down from this dark vault to be burnt alive!  Such terrible tales enveloped the tower with a horrible fascination to my young mind. What a fearful contrast to the merry sound of the chimes issuing from its roof on a bright summer day.\\n\\nOn my way up to the top flat, where the chimes were played, I had to pass through the vault in which the great pendulum was slowly swinging in its ghostly-like tick-tack, tick-tack; while the great ancient clock was keeping time with its sudden and startling movement.  The whole scene was almost as uncanny as the witches' cell underneath.  There was also a wild rumbling thumping sound overhead.  I soon discovered the cause of this, when I entered the flat where the musician was at work. He was seen in violent action, beating or hammering on the keys of a gigantic pianoforte-like apparatus.  The instruments he used were two great leather-faced mallets, one of which he held in each hand. Each key was connected by iron rods with the chime-bells above. The frantic and mad-like movements of the musician, as he energetically rushed from one key to another, often widely apart gave me the idea that the man was daft--especially as the noise of the mallets was such that I heard no music emitted from the chimes so far overhead. It was only when I had climbed up the stair of the tower to where the bells were rung that I understood the performance, and comprehended the beating of the chimes which gave me so much pleasure when I heard them at a distance.\\n\\nAnother source of enjoyment in my early days was to accompany my mother to the market.  As I have said before, my mother, though generous in her hospitality, was necessarily thrifty and economical in the management of her household.  There were no less than fourteen persons in the house to be fed, and this required a good deal of marketing. At the time I refer to, (about 1816, it was the practice of every lady who took pride in managing economically the home department of her husband's affairs, to go to market in person.  The principal markets in Edinburgh were then situated in the valley between the Old and New Towns, in what used to be called the Nor Loch.\\n\\nDealers in fish and vegetables had their stalls there: the market for butcher meat was near at hand: each being in their several locations. It was a very lively and bustling sight to see the marketing going on. When a lady was observed approaching, likely to be a customer, she was at once surrounded by the \\\"caddies.\\\"  They were a set of sturdy hard-working women, each with a creel on her back.  Their competition for the employer sometimes took a rather energetic form.  The rival candidates pointed to her with violent exclamations; \\\"She's my ledie! she's my ledie!\\\" ejaculated one and all.  To dispel the disorder, a selection of one of the caddies would be made, and then all was quiet again until another customer appeared.\\n\\nThere was a regular order in which the purchases were deposited in the creel.  First, there came the fish, which were carefully deposited in the lowest part, with a clean deal board over them.  The fishwives were a most sturdy and independent class, both in manners and language. When at home, at Newhaven or Fisherrow, they made and mended their husbands' nets, put their fishing tackle to rights, and when the fishing boats came in they took the fish to market at Edinburgh. To see the groups of these hard-working women trudging along with their heavy creels on their backs, clothed in their remarkable costume, with their striped petticoats kilted up and showing their sturdy legs, was indeed a remarkable sight.  They were cheerful and good-natured, but very outspoken.  Their skins were clear and ruddy, and many of the young fishwives were handsome and pretty.  They were, in fact, the incarnation of robust health.  In dealing with them at the Fish Market there was a good deal of higgling.  They often asked two or three times more than the fish were worth--at least, according to the then market price.  After a stormy night, during which the husbands and sons had toiled to catch the fish, on the usual question being asked, \\\"Weel, Janet, hoo's haddies the day!\\\" \\\"Haddies, mem?  Ou, haddies is men's lives the day!\\\"  which was often true, as haddocks were often caught at the risk of their husbands' lives.  After the usual amount of higgling, the haddies were brought down to their proper market price, --sometimes a penny for a good haddock, or, when herrings were rife, a dozen herrings for twopence, crabs for a penny, and lobsters for threepence.  For there were no railways then to convey the fish to England, and thus equalise the price for all classes of the community.\\n\\nLet me mention here a controversy between a fishwife and a buyer called Thomson.  the buyer offered a price so ridiculously small for a parcel of fish that the seller became quite indignant, and she terminated at once all further higgling.  Looking up to him, she said, \\\"Lord help yer e'e-sight, Maister Tamson!\\\" \\\"Lord help my e'e-sight, woman!  What has that to do with it?\\\" \\\"Ou,\\\" said she, \\\"because ye ha'e nae nose to put spectacles on!\\\"  As it happened, poor Mr. Thomson had, by some accident or disease, so little of a nose left, if any at all, that the bridge of the nose for holding up the spectacles was almost entirely wanting. And thus did the fishwife retaliate on her niggardly customer.\\n\\nWhen my mother had got her fish laid at the bottom of the creel, she next went to the \\\"flesher\\\" for her butcher-meat.  There was no higgling here, for the meat was sold at the ordinary market price. Then came the poultry stratum; then the vegetables, or fruits in their season; and, finally, there was \\\"the floore\\\"--a bunch of flowers; not a costly bouquet, but a, large assortment of wallflowers, daffodils (with their early spring fragrance), polyanthuses, lilacs, gilly-flowers, and the glorious old-fashioned cabbage rose, as well as the even more gloriously fragrant moss rose. The caddy's creel was then topped up, and the marketing was completed.  The lady was followed home; the contents were placed in the larder; and the flowers distributed all over the house.\\n\\nI have many curious traditional evidences of the great fondness for cats which distinguished the Nasmyth family for several generations. My father had always one or two of such domestic favourites, who were, in the best sense, his \\\"familiars.\\\"  Their quiet, companionable habits rendered them very acceptable company when engaged in his artistic work.  I know of no sound so pleasantly tranquillising as the purring of a cat, or of anything more worthy of admiration in animal habit as the neat, compact, and elegant manner in which the cat adjusts itself at the fireside, or in a snug, cosy place, when it settles down for a long quiet sleep.  Every spare moment that a cat has before lying down to rest is occupied in carefully cleaning itself, even under adverse circumstances.  The cat is the true original inventor of a sanitary process, which has lately been patented and paraded before the public as a sanitary novelty; and yet it has been in practice ever since cats were created.  Would that men and women were more alive to habitual cleanliness--even the cleanliness of cats.  The kindly and gentle animal gives us all a lesson in these respects.\\n\\nThen, nothing can be more beautiful in animal action than the exquisitely precise and graceful manner in which the cat exerts the exact amount of effort requisite to land it at the height and spot it wishes to reach at one bound.  The neat and delicately precise manner in which cats use their paws when playing with those who habitually treat them with gentle kindness is truly admirable.  In these respects cats are entitled to the most kindly regard.  There are, unfortunately, many who entertain a strong prejudice against this most perfect and beautiful member of the animal creation, and who abuse them because they resist ill-treatment, occasioned by their innate feeling of independence.  Cats have no doubt less personal attachment than dogs, but when kindly treated they become in many respects attached and affectionate animals.\\n\\nMy father, when a boy, made occasional visits to Hamilton, in the West of Scotland, where the descendants of his Covenanting ancestors still lived.  One of them was an old bachelor--a recluse sort of man; and yet he had the Nasmyth love of cats.  Being of pious pedigree and habits, he always ended the day by a long and audible prayer. My father and his companions used to go to the door of his house to listen to him, but especially to hear his culminating finale. He prayed that the Lord would help him to forgive his enemies and all those who had done him injury; and then, with a loud burst, he concluded, \\\"Except John Anderson o' the Toonhead, for he killed my cat, and him I'll ne'er forgie!  In conclusion, I may again refer to Elspeth Nasmyth, who was burnt alive for witchcraft, because she had four black cats, and read her Bible through two Pairs of spectacles!\\n\\nCHAPTER 5.  My School-days.\\n\\nBefore I went to school it was my good fortune to be placed under the special care of my eldest sister, Jane.  She was twenty years older than myself, and had acquired much practical experience in the management of the younger members of the family.  I could not have had a more careful teacher.  She initiated me into the difficulties of A B C, and by learning me to read she gave me a key to the thoughts of the greatest thinkers who have ever lived.\\n\\nBut all this was accomplished at first in a humdrum and tentative way. About seventy years ago children's books were very uninteresting. In the little stories manufactured for children, the good boy ended in a Coach-and-four, and the bad boy in a ride to Tyburn.  The good boys must have been a set of little snobs and prigs, and I could scarcely imagine that they could ever have lived as they were represented in these goody books.  If so, they must have been the most tiresome and uninteresting vermin that can possibly be imagined. After my sister had done what she could for me, I was sent to school to learn \\\"English.\\\" I was placed under the tuition of a leading teacher called Knight, whose school-room was in the upper storey of a house in George Street. Here I learned to read with ease.  But my primitive habit of spelling by ear, in accordance with the simple sound of the letters of the alphabet (phonetically, so to speak) brought me into collision with my teacher.  I got many a cuff on the side of the head, and many a \\\"palmy\\\" on my hands with a thick strap of hard leather, which did not give me very inviting views as to the pleasures of learning. The master was vicious and vindictive.  I think it a cowardly way to deal with a little boy in so cruel a manner, and to send him home with his back and fingers tingling and sometimes bleeding, because he cannot learn so quickly as his fellows.\\n\\nOn one occasion Knight got out of temper with my stupidity or dulness in not comprehending something about 'a preter-pluperfect tense,' or some mystery of that sort.  He seized me by the ears, and beat my head against the wall behind me with such savage violence that when he let me go, stunned and unable to stand, I fell forward on the floor bleeding violently at the nose, and with a terrific headache. The wretch might have ruined my brain for life.  I was carried home and put to bed, where I lay helpless for more than a week.  My father threatened to summon the teacher before the magistrates for what might have been a fatal assault on poor little me; but on making a humble apology for his brutal usage he was let off.  Of course I was not sent back to his school.  I have ever since entertained a hatred against grammatical rules.\\n\\nThere was at that time an excellent system of teaching young folks the value of thrift.  This consisted in saving for some purpose or another the Saturdays penny--one penny being our weekly allowance of pocket-money.  The feats we could perform in the way of procuring toys, picture-books, or the materials for constructing flying kites, would amaze the youngsters of the present day, who are generally spoiled by extravagance.  And yet we obtained far more pleasure from our purchases.  We had in my time \\\"penny pigs,\\\" or thrift boxes. They were made in a vase form, of brown glazed earthenware, the only entrance to which was a slit--enough to give entrance to a penny. When the Saturday's penny was not required for any immediate purposes, it was dropped through the slit, and remained there until the box was full.  The maximum of pennies it could contain was about forty-eight. When that was accomplished, the penny pig was broken with a hammer, and its rich contents flowed forth.  The breaking of the pig was quite an event.  The fine fat old George the Third penny pieces looked thoroughly substantial in our eyes.  And then there was the spending of the money,--for some long-looked-for toy, or pencils, or book, or painting materials.\\n\\nOne of the ways in which I used my Saturday pennies was in going with some of my companions into the country to have a picnic.  We used to light a fire behind a hedge or a dyke, or in the corner of some ruin, and there roast our potatoes, or broil a red herring on an extempore gridiron we contrived for the purpose.  We lit the fire by means of a flint and steel and a tinder-box, which in those days every boy used to possess.  The bramble-berries gave us our dessert.  We thoroughly enjoyed these glorious Saturday afternoons.  It gave us quite a Robinson Crusoe sort of feeling to be thus secluded from the world. Then the beauty of the scenery amidst which we took our repast was such as I cannot attempt to describe.  A walk of an hour or so would bring us into the presence of an old castle, or amongst the rocky furze and heather-clad hills, amidst clear rapid streams, so that, but for the distant peeps of the city, one might think that he was far from the busy haunts of men and boys.\\n\\nTo return to my school-days.  Shortly after I left the school in George Street, where the schoolmaster had almost split my skull in battering it upon the wall behind me, I was entered as a pupil at the Edinburgh High School, in October 1817.  The school was situated near the old Infirmary.  Professor Pillans was the rector, and under him were four masters.  I was set to study Latin under Mr. Irvine.  He was a mere schoolmaster in the narrowest sense of the term.  He was not endowed with the best of tempers, and it was often put to the breaking strain by the tricks and negligence of the lower-form portion of his class.  It consisted of nearly two hundred boys; the other three masters had about the same number of scholars. They each had a separate class-room.\",\"timestamp\":1639288602,\"title\":\"\\nThen came Waterloo and the victory!
