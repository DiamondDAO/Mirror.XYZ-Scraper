"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you followed encrypted Twitter over the holidays, you might have noticed how 2021 ended with perfect encryption, i.e., heated debate. This time it's not about Alt L1 vs Ethereum L2, it's about Web3 legitimacy. And it's not two sides of the crypto industry facing off, it's Jack Dorsey versus venture capital firms. What started it all started when Jack Dorsey retweeted a meme about how Web3 was channelled all its value into the mouths of Silicon Valley venture capital firms, leaving retail investors with only a few drops of value. I've seen it in other places, so it's not just Jack's problem. To some, \\\"Web3\\\" is a marketing term that VCS are using to make short-term investments. They invest in hype - not substance - and then use that hype to turn around and sell it to retail investors who can't get Access to Web3 investment. There is some truth to this. The hype around Web3 is important. A16z even sponsored a public opinion survey ‌ to gauge how people felt about the term \\\"Web3\\\". And it turns out: people like it. So are venture capital firms taking advantage of this by bringing retail investors into seed rounds early? Will the future of Web3 be forever denied? Or would something completely different have happened? Below, let's analyze it. On 16 September 2020, Uniswap minted UNI tokens and airdropped 60% of the supply to the community (through a combination of a traceback airdrop and the community fund pool). For reference, tracing the airdrop involved more than 250,000 individual addresses on Ethereum. Uniswap kicked off the retroactive airdrop campaign, which has since resulted in hundreds of retroactive airdrops, allocating billions of dollars to hundreds of thousands of individual individuals who have interacted in some capacity with certain cryptographic applications. Uniswap's $11 million Series A seed round was led by A16Z, with other venture capital firms participating. Ask yourself: does the Uniswap airdrop increase or decrease the value of these vc firms' seed investments in Uniswap? I think adding distribution and significant retail ownership on Uniswap adds an order of magnitude of value to the vc firm's investment. Value comes from consistent incentives, and Uniswap illustrates how VCS can make economic sense to participate and allocate capital to retail investors. The Uniswap airdrop gave free capital to 250,000 individual Ethereum addresses and also provided a liquidity event for early-stage venture capital firms. However, not all Web3 investments have fared as well as Uniswap. But there are better ones. The ENS Ethereum domain name service airdropped 50 percent of ENS 'total supply to its users, with the other 50 percent allocated to the project's approximately 500 early contributors and ecosystem participants. ENS has never raised a dime from VCS. If any fund wants to acquire ENS, they will have to buy it from ENS users\",\"timestamp\":1641355725,\"title\":\"Jack Dorsey And Web3\"},\"digest\":\"EpJnb8yIcRu8KsTkit-yjHXT_mQzxbeKEPWHXSFMujM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x293aD19fe4be501A46079B095615418E147C7EEf\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1zentq2cB4sqrGkowZOxW_DoG9kC6gfsExoUnNYB4S4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b99EBeILRB3eHPw1WA2pySPK9r5ioi_XN8ft2tg8OXQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Me24FNTW9OwokgNvEawZzXa6s9cWteBsT9iWsYPyvaLZEVwyZDoYpHA-0Z7Wq2kWyLwhHocm1UCBtDnT5coXuQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6e5cae4ccb488b686c519d3106d6e276c427df2c30cbc7d1d033575d117814c138aa2dc0bf695ad0e10ac28a30c1b4f504e203ed4b80e028268cd5ad959772ce1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1zentq2cB4sqrGkowZOxW_DoG9kC6gfsExoUnNYB4S4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"b99EBeILRB3eHPw1WA2pySPK9r5ioi_XN8ft2tg8OXQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EpJnb8yIcRu8KsTkit-yjHXT_mQzxbeKEPWHXSFMujM\"}"
