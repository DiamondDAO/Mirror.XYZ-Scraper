"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Exclamations not allowed in sober argument, Zoe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, Ned, it is not heart-disease, it is purse disease. Just do me a favor. Here are five sovereigns; give those to the old beggar, and let him risk them.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could hardly take such a liberty with an old gentleman of his age and appearance--a man of honor too, and high sentiments. Why, I'd bet seven to four he is one of Napoleon's old soldiers.\\\"\\n\\nThe ladies sided unanimously with Severne. \\\"What! offer a *vieux de l'Empire* five pounds? Oh, fie!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Fiddle-dee-dee!\\\" said the indomitable Vizard. \\\"Besides, he will do it with his usual grace. He will approach the son of Mars with that feigned humility which sits so well on youth, and ask him, as a personal favor, to invest five pounds for him at *rouge-et-noir.* The old soldier will stiffen into double dignity at first, then give him a low wink, and end by sitting down and gambling. He will be cautious at starting, as one who opens trenches for the siege of Mammon; but soon the veteran will get heated, and give battle; he will fancy himself at Jena, since the croupiers are Prussians. If he loses, you cut him dead, being a humdrum Englishman; and if he wins, he cuts you, and pockets the cash, being a Frenchman that talks sentiment.\\\"\\n\\nThis sally provoked a laugh, in which Severne joined, and said, \\\"Really, for a landed proprietor, you know a thing or two.\\\" He consented at last, with some reluctance, to take the money; and none of the persons present doubted that he would execute the commission with a grace and delicacy all his own. Nevertheless, to run forward a little with the narrative, I must tell you that he never did hand that five pound to the venerable sire; a little thing prevented him--the old man wasn't born yet.\\n\\n\\\"And now,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"it is our last day in Homburg. You are all going to gratify your mania--lunacy is contagious. Suppose I gratify mine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do dear,\\\" said Zoe; \\\"and what is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like your asking that; when it was publicly announced last night, and I fled discomfited to my balcony, and, in my confusion, lighted a cigar. My mania is--the Klosking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is not a mania; it is good taste. She is admirable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, in an opera; but I want to know how she looks and talks in a room; and that is insane of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then so you *shall,* insane or not. I will call on her this morning, and take you in my hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What an ample palm! and what juvenile audacity! Zoe, you take my breath away.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No audacity at all. I am sure of my welcome. How often must I tell you that we have mesmerized each other, that lady and I, and only waiting an opportunity to rush into each other's arms. It began with her singling me out at the opera. But I dare say that was owing, *at first,* only to my being in full dress.\\n\\n\\\"No, no; to your being, like Agamemnon, a head taller than all the other Greeks.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Harrington! I am not a Greek. I am a thorough English girl at heart, though I am as black as a coal.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No apology needed in our present frame. You are all the more like the ace of spades.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you want me to take you to the Klosking, sir? Then you had better not make fun of me. I tell you she sung to *me,* and smiled on *me,* and courtesied to *me;* and, now you have put it into my head, I mean to call upon her, and I will take you with me. What I shall do, I shall send in my card. I shall be admitted, and you will wait outside. As soon as she sees me, she will run to me with both hands out, and say, in excellent *French,* I hope, *'How,* mademoiselle! you have deigned to remember me, and to honor me with a visit.' Then I shall say, in school-French, 'Yes, madame; excuse the intrusion, but I was so charmed with your performance. We leave Homburg to-morrow, and as, unfortunately for myself, I cannot have the pleasure of seeing you again upon the stage--' then I shall stop, for her to interrupt me. Then she will interrupt me, and say charming things, as only foreigners can; and then I shall say, still in school-French, 'Madame, I am not alone. I have my brother with me. He adores music, and was as fascinated with your Siebel as myself. May I present him?' Then she will say, 'Oh, yes, by all means;' and I shall introduce you. Then you can make love to her. That will be droll. Fanny, I'll tell you every word he says.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Make love to her!\\\" cried Vizard. \\\"Is this your estimate of a brother's motives. My object in visiting this lady is, not to feed my mania, but to cure it. I have seen her on the stage, looking like the incarnation of a poet's dream. I am *extasie'* with her. Now let me catch her *en de'shabille,* with her porter on one side, and her lover on the other: and so to Devonshire, relieved of a fatal illusion.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If that is your view, I'll go by myself; for I know she is a noble woman, and as much a lady off the stage as on it. My only fear is she will talk that dreadful guttural German, with its 'oches' and its 'aches,' and then where shall we all be? We must ask Mr. Severne to go with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A good idea. No--a vile one. He is abominably handsome, and has the gift of the gab--in German, and other languages. He is sure to cut me out, the villain! Look him up, somebody, till we come back.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Now, Harrington, don't be absurd. He must, and shall, be of the party. I have my reasons. Mr. Severne,\\\" said she, turning on him with a blush and a divine smile, \\\"you will oblige me, I am sure.\\\"\\n\\nSeverne's face turned as blank as a doll's, and he said nothing, one way or other.\\n\\nIt was settled that they should all meet at the Kursaal at four, to dine and play. But Zoe and her party would go on ahead by the one-o'clock train; and so she retired to put on her bonnet--a technical expression, which implies a good deal.\\n\\nFanny went with her, and, as events more exciting than the usual routine of their young lives were ahead, their tongues went a rare pace. But the only thing worth presenting to the reader came at the end, after the said business of the toilet had been dispatched.\\n\\nZoe said, \\\"I must go now, or I shall keep them waiting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only one, dear,\\\" said Fanny dryly.\\n\\n\\\"Why only one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Severne will not go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That he will: I made a point of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You did, dear? but still he will not go.\\\"\\n\\nThere was something in this, and in Fanny's tone, that startled Zoe, and puzzled her sorely. She turned round upon her with flashing eye, and said, \\\"No mysteries, please, dear. Why won't he go with me wherever I ask him to go? or, rather, what makes you think he won't?\\\"\\n\\nSaid Fanny, thoughtfully: \\\"I could not tell you, all in a moment, why I feel so positive. One puts little things together that are nothing apart: one observes faces; I do, at least. You don't seem, to me, to be so quick at that as most girls. But, Zoe dear, you know very well one often knows a thing for certain, yet one doesn't know exactly what makes one know it.\\\"\\n\\nNow Zoe's *amour propre* was wounded by Fanny's suggestion that Severne would not go to Homburg, or, indeed, to the world's end with her; so she drew herself up in her grand way, and folded her arms and said, a little haughtily, \\\"Then tell me what is it you know about *him* and me, without knowing how on earth you know it.\\\"\\n\\nThe supercilious tone and grand manner nettled Fanny, and it wasn't \\\"brooch day;\\\" she stood up to her lofty cousin like a little game-cock. \\\"I know this,\\\" said she, with heightened cheek, and flashing eyes and a voice of steel, \\\"you will never get Mr. Edward Severne into one room with Zoe Vizard and Ina Klosking.\\\"\\n\\nZoe Vizard turned very pale, but her eyes flashed defiance on her friend.\\n\\n\\\"That I'll know!\\\" said she, in a deep voice, with a little gasp, but a world of pride and resolution.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII.\\n\\nTHE ladies went down together, and found Vizard ready. Mr. Severne was not in the room. Zoe inquired after him.\\n\\n\\\"Gone to get a sun-shade,\\\" said Vizard.\\n\\n\\\"There!\\\" said Zoe to Fanny, in a triumphant whisper. \\\"What is that for but to go with us?\\\"\\n\\nFanny made no reply.\\n\\nThey waited some time for Severne and his sun-shade.\\n\\nAt last Vizard looked at his watch, and said they had only five minutes to spare. \\\"Come down, and look after him. He *must* be somewhere about.\\\"\\n\\nThey went down and looked for him all over the Platz. He was not to be seen. At last Vizard took out his watch, and said, \\\"It is some misunderstanding: we can't wait any longer.\\\"\\n\\nSo he and Zoe went to the train. Neither said much on the way to Homburg; for they were both brooding. Vizard's good sense and right feeling were beginning to sting him a little for calling on the Klosking at all, and a great deal for using the enthusiasm of an inexperienced girl to obtain an introduction to a public singer. He sat moody in his corner, taking himself to task. Zoe's thoughts ran in quite another channel; but she was no easier in her mind. It really seemed as if Severne had given her the slip. Probably he would explain his conduct; but, then, that Fanny should foretell he would avoid her company, rather than call on Mademoiselle Klosking, and that Fanny should be right--this made the thing serious, and galled Zoe to the quick: she was angry with Fanny for prophesying truly; she was rather angry with Severne for not coming, and more angry with him for making good Fanny's prediction.\\n\\nZoe Vizard was a good girl and a generous girl, but she was not a humble girl: she had a great deal of pride, and her share of vanity, and here both were galled. Besides that, it seemed to her most strange and disheartening that Fanny, who did not love Severne, should be able to foretell his conduct better than she, who did love him: such foresight looked like greater insight. All this humiliated and also puzzled her strangely; and so she sat brooding as deeply as her brother.\\n\\nAs for Vizard, by the time they got to Homburg he had made up his mind. As they got out of the train, he said, \\\"Look here, I am ashamed of myself. I have a right to play the fool alone; but I have no business to drag my sister into it. We will go somewhere else. There are lots of things to see. I give up the Klosking.\\\"\\n\\nZoe stared at him a moment, and then answered, with cold decision, \\\"No, dear; you must allow me to call on her, now I am here. She won't bite *me.\\\"*\\n\\n\\\"Well, but it is a strange thing to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does that matter? We are abroad.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come, Zoe, I am much obliged to you; but give it up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, dear.\\\"\\n\\nHarrington smiled at her pretty peremptoriness, and misunderstood it. \\\"This is carrying sisterly love a long way,\\\" said he. \\\"I must try and rise to your level. I won't go with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I shall go alone.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What if I forbid you, miss?\\\"\\n\\nShe tapped him on the cheek with her fingers. \\\"Don't affect the tyrant, dear; you can't manage it. Fanny said something that has mortified me. I shall go. You can do as you like. But, stop; where does she live?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Suppose I decline to tell you? I am seized with a virtuous fit--a regular paroxysm.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I shall go to the opera and inquire, dear. But\\\" (coaxingly) \\\"you will tell me, dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There,\\\" said Harrington, \\\"you wicked, tempting girl, my sham virtue has oozed away, and my real mania triumphs. She lives at 'The Golden Star.' I was weak enough to send Harris in last night to learn.\\\" Zoe smiled.\\n\\nHe hailed a conveyance; and they started at once for \\\"The Golden Star.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Zoe,\\\" said Harrington gravely, \\\"something tells me I am going to meet my fate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All the better,\\\" said Zoe. \\\"I wish you to meet your fate. My love for my brother is not selfish. I am sure she is a good woman. Perhaps I may find out something.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, never mind.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII.\\n\\nALL this time Ina Klosking was rehearsing at the theater, quite unconscious of the impending visit. A royal personage had commanded \\\"Il Barbiere,\\\" the part of Rosina to be restored to the original key. It was written for a contralto, but transposed by the influence of Grisi.\\n\\nHaving no performance that night, they began to rehearse rather later than usual, and did not leave off till a quarter to four o'clock. Ina, who suffered a good deal at rehearsals from the inaccuracy and apathy of the people, went home fagged, and with her throat parched--so does a bad rehearsal affect all good and earnest artists.\\n\\nShe ordered a cutlet, with potato chips, and lay down on the sofa. While she was reposing, came Joseph Ashmead, to cheer her, with good photographs of her, taken the day before. She smiled gratefully at his zeal. He also reminded her that he had orders to take her to the Kursaal: he said the tables would be well filled from five o'clock till quite late, there being no other entertainment on foot that evening.\\n\\nIna thanked him, and said she would not miss going on any account; but she was rather fatigued and faint.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I'll wait for you as long as you like,\\\" said Ashmead, kindly.\\n\\n\\\"No, my good comrade,\\\" said Ina. \\\"I will ask you to go to the manager and get me a little money, and then to the Kursaal and secure me a place at the table in the largest room. There I will join you. If *he* is not there--and I am not so mad as to think he will be there--I shall risk a few pieces myself, to be nearer him in mind.\\\"\\n\\nThis amazed Ashmead; it was so unlike her. \\\"You are joking,\\\" said he. \\\"Why, if you lose five napoleons at play, it will be your death; you will grizzle so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; but I shall not lose. I am too unlucky in love to lose at cards. I mean to play this afternoon; and never again in all my life. Sir, I am resolved.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, if you are resolved, there is no more to be said. I won't run my head against a brick wall.\\\"\\n\\nIna, being half a foreigner, thought this rather brusk. She looked at him askant, and said, quietly, \\\"Others, besides me, can be stubborn, and get their own way, while speaking the language of submission. Not I invented volition.\\\"\\n\\nWith this flea in his ear, the faithful Joseph went off, chuckling, and obtained an advance from the manager, and then proceeded to the principal gaming-table, and, after waiting some time, secured a chair, which he kept for his chief.\\n\\nAn hour went by; an hour and a half. He was obliged, for very shame, to bet. This he did, five francs at a time; and his risk was so small, and his luck so even, that by degrees he was drawn into conversation with his neighbor, a young swell, who was watching the run of the colors, and betting in silver, and pricking a card, preparatory to going in for a great *coup.* Meantime he favored Mr. Ashmead with his theory of chances, and Ashmead listened very politely to every word; because he was rather proud of the other's notice: he was so handsome, well dressed, and well spoken.\\n\\nMeantime Ina Klosking snatched a few minutes' sleep, as most artists can in the afternoon, and was awakened by the servant bringing in her frugal repast, a cutlet and a pint of Bordeaux.\\n\\nOn her plate he brought her a large card, on which was printed \\\"Miss Zoe Vizard.\\\" This led to inquiries, and he told her a lady of superlative beauty had called and left that card. Ina asked for a description.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, madame,\\\" said Karl, \\\"do not expect details from me. I was too dazzled, and struck by lightning, to make an inventory of her charms.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At least you can tell me was she dark or fair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madame, she was dark as night; but glorious as the sun. Her earthly abode is the Russie, at Frankfort; blest hotel!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did she tell you so?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indirectly. She wrote on the card with the smallest pencil I have hitherto witnessed: the letters are faint, the pencil being inferior to the case, which was golden. Nevertheless, as one is naturally curious to learn whence a bright vision has emerged, I permitted myself to decipher.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your curiosity was natural,\\\" said Ina, dryly. \\\"I will detain you with no more questions.\\\"\\n\\nShe put the card carefully away, and eat her modest repast. Then she made her afternoon toilet, and walked, slowly and pensively, to the Kursaal.\\n\\nNothing there was new to her, except to be going to the table without the man on whom it was her misfortune to have wasted her heart of gold.\\n\\nI think, therefore, it would be better for me to enter the place in company with our novices; and, indeed, we must, or we shall derange the true order of time and sequence of incidents; for, please observe, all the English ladies of our story met at the Kursaal while Ina was reposing on her sofa.\\n\\nThe first-comers were Zoe and Harrington. They entered the noble hall, inscribed their names, and, by that simple ceremony, were members of a club, compared with which the greatest clubs in London are petty things: a club with spacious dining-rooms, ball-rooms, concert-rooms, gambling-rooms, theater, and delicious gardens. The building, that combined so many rich treats, was colossal in size, and glorious with rich colors and gold laid on with Oriental profusion, and sometimes with Oriental taste.\\n\\nHarrington took his sister through the drawing-rooms first; and she admired the unusual loftiness of the rooms, the blaze of white and gold, and of *ce'ladon* and gold, and the great Russian lusters, and the mighty mirrors. But when they got to the dining-room she was enchanted. That lofty and magnificent *salon,* with its daring mixture of red and black, and green and blue, all melted into harmony by the rivers of gold that ran boldly among them, went to her very heart. A Greek is half an Oriental; and Zoe had what may be called the courage of color. \\\"Glorious!\\\" she cried, and clasped her hands. \\\"And see! what a background to the emerald grass outside and the ruby flowers. They seem to come into the room through those monster windows.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Splendid!\\\" said Harrington, to whom all this was literally Greek. \\\"I'm so excited, I'll order dinner.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Dinner!\\\" said Zoe, disdainfully; and sat down and eyed the Moresque walls around her, and the beauties of nature outside, and brought them together in one picture.\\n\\nHarrington was a long time in conclave with M. Chevet. Then Zoe became impatient.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, do leave off ordering dinner,\\\" said she, \\\"and take me out to that other paradise.\\\"\\n\\nThe Chevet shrugged his shoulders with pity. Vizard shrugged his too, to soothe him; and, after a few more hurried words, took the lover of color into the garden. It was delicious, with green slopes, and rich foliage, and flowers, and enlivened by bright silk dresses, sparkling fitfully among the green leaves, or flaming out boldly in the sun; and, as luck would have it, before Zoe had taken ten steps upon the greensward, the band of fifty musicians struck up, and played as fifty men rarely play together out of Germany.\\n\\nZoe was enchanted. She walked on air, and beamed as bright as any flower in the place.\\n\\nAfter her first ejaculation at the sudden music, she did not speak for a good while; her content was so great. At last she said, \\\"And do they leave this paradise to gamble in a room?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Leave it? They shun it. The gamblers despise the flowers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How perverse people are! Excitement! Who wants any more than this?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Zoe,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"innocent excitement can never compete with vicious.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What, is it really wicked to play?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know about wicked; you girls always run to the biggest word. But, if avarice is a vice, gambling cannot be virtuous; for the root of gambling is mere avarice, weak avarice. Come, my young friend, *as we're quite alone,* I'll drop Thersites, and talk sense to you, for once. Child, there are two roads to wealth; one is by the way of industry, skill, vigilance, and self-denial; and these are virtues, though sometimes they go with tricks of trade, hardness of heart, and taking advantage of misfortune, to buy cheap and sell dear. The other road to wealth is by bold speculation, with risk of proportionate loss; in short, by gambling with cards, or without them. Now, look into the mind of the gambler--he wants to make money, contrary to nature, and unjustly. He wants to be rewarded without merit, to make a fortune in a moment, and without industry, vigilance, true skill, or self-denial. 'A penny saved is a penny gained' does not enter his creed. Strip the thing of its disguise, it is avarice, sordid avarice; and I call it weak avarice, because the gambler relies on chance alone, yet accepts uneven chances, and hopes that Fortune will be as much in love with him as he is with himself. What silly egotism! You admire the Kursaal, and you are right; then do just ask yourself why is there nothing to pay for so many expensive enjoyments: and very little to pay for concerts and balls; low prices at the opera, which never pays its own expenses; even Chevet's dinners are reasonable, if you avoid his sham Johannisberg. All these cheap delights, the gold, the colors, the garden, the music, the lights, are paid for by the losses of feeble-minded Avarice. But, there--I said all this to Ned Severne, and I might as well have preached sense to the wind.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Harrington, I will not play. I am much happier walking with my good brother--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Faute de mieux.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/34](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/34)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637668597,\"title\":\"And now it has added, _'Le philosophe sans le vouloir,'_ and you have stumbled on him.
