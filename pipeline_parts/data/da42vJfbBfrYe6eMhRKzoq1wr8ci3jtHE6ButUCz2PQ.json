"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Under Queen Anne he was an original poet, but made little money by his verses; under George I. he was chiefly a translator, and made much money by satisfying the French-classical taste with versions of the \\\"Iliad\\\" and \\\"Odyssey.\\\"  Under George I. he also edited Shakespeare, but with little profit to himself; for Shakespeare was but a Philistine in the eyes of the French-classical critics.  But as the eighteenth century grew slowly to its work, signs of a deepening interest in the real issues of life distracted men's attention from the culture of the snuff-box and the fan.  As Pope's genius ripened, the best part of the world in which he worked was pressing forward, as a mariner who will no longer hug the coast but crowds all sail to cross the storms of a wide unknown sea.  Pope's poetry thus deepened with the course of time, and the third period of his life, which fell within the reign of George II., was that in which he produced the \\\"Essay on Man,\\\" the \\\"Moral Essays,\\\" and the \\\"Satires.\\\"  These deal wholly with aspects of human life and the great questions they raise, according throughout with the doctrine of the poet, and of the reasoning world about him in his latter day, that \\\"the proper study of mankind is Man.\\\"\\n\\nWrongs in high places, and the private infamy of many who enforced the doctrines of the Church, had produced in earnest men a vigorous antagonism. Tyranny and unreason of low-minded advocates had brought religion itself into question; and profligacy of courtiers, each worshipping the golden calf seen in his mirror, had spread another form of scepticism.  The intellectual scepticism, based upon an honest search for truth, could end only in making truth the surer by its questionings.  The other form of scepticism, which might be traced in England from the low-minded frivolities of the court of Charles the Second, was widely spread among the weak, whose minds flinched from all earnest thought.  They swelled the number of the army of bold questioners upon the ways of God to Man, but they were an idle rout of camp-followers, not combatants; they simply ate, and drank, and died.\\n\\nIn 1697, Pierre Bayle published at Rotterdam, his \\\"Historical and Critical Dictionary,\\\" in which the lives of men were associated with a comment that suggested, from the ills of life, the absence of divine care in the shaping of the world.  Doubt was born of the corruption of society; Nature and Man were said to be against faith in the rule of a God, wise, just, and merciful.  In 1710, after Bayle's death, Leibnitz, a German philosopher then resident in Paris, wrote in French a book, with a title formed from Greek words meaning Justice of God, Theodicee, in which he met Bayle's argument by reasoning that what we cannot understand confuses us, because we see only the parts of a great whole.  Bayle, he said, is now in Heaven, and from his place by the throne of God, he sees the harmony of the great Universe, and doubts no more.  We see only a little part in which are many details that have purposes beyond our ken.  The argument of Leibnitz's Theodicee was widely used; and although Pope said that he had never read the Theodicee, his \\\"Essay on Man\\\" has a like argument.  When any book has a wide influence upon opinion, its general ideas pass into the minds of many people who have never read it.  Many now talk about evolution and natural selection, who have never read a line of Darwin.\\n\\nIn the reign of George the Second, questionings did spread that went to the roots of all religious faith, and many earnest minds were busying themselves with problems of the state of Man, and of the evidence of God in the life of man, and in the course of Nature.  Out of this came, nearly at the same time, two works wholly different in method and in tone -- so different, that at first sight it may seem absurd to speak of them together.  They were Pope's \\\"Essay on Man,\\\" and Butler's \\\"Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature.\\\"\\n\\nButler's \\\"Analogy\\\" was published in 1736; of the \\\"Essay on Man,\\\" the first two Epistles appeared in 1732, the Third Epistle in 1733, the Fourth in 1734, and the closing Universal Hymn in 1738.  It may seem even more absurd to name Pope's \\\"Essay on Man\\\" in the same breath with Milton's \\\"Paradise Lost;\\\" but to the best of his knowledge and power, in his smaller way, according to his nature and the questions of his time, Pope was, like Milton, endeavouring \\\"to justify the ways of God to Man.\\\"  He even borrowed Milton's line for his own poem, only weakening the verb, and said that he sought to \\\"vindicate the ways of God to Man.\\\"  In Milton's day the questioning all centred in the doctrine of the \\\"Fall of Man,\\\" and questions of God's Justice were associated with debate on fate, fore-knowledge, and free will.  In Pope's day the question was not theological, but went to the root of all faith in existence of a God, by declaring that the state of Man and of the world about him met such faith with an absolute denial.  Pope's argument, good or bad, had nothing to do with questions of theology.  Like Butler's, it sought for grounds of faith in the conditions on which doubt was rested.  Milton sought to set forth the story of the Fall in such way as to show that God was love.  Pope dealt with the question of God in Nature, and the world of Man.\\n\\nPope's argument was attacked with violence by M. de Crousaz, Professor of Philosophy and Mathematics in the University of Lausanne, and defended by Warburton, then chaplain to the Prince of Wales, in six letters published in 1739, and a seventh in 1740, for which Pope (who died in 1744) was deeply grateful.  His offence in the eyes of de Crousaz was that he had left out of account all doctrines of orthodox theology.  But if he had been orthodox of the orthodox, his argument obviously could have been directed only to the form of doubt it sought to overcome.  And when his closing hymn was condemned as the freethinker's hymn, its censurers surely forgot that their arguments against it would equally apply to the Lord's Prayer, of which it is, in some degree, a paraphrase.\\n\\nThe first design of the Essay on Man arranged it into four books, each consisting of a distinct group of Epistles.  The First Book, in four Epistles, was to treat of man in the abstract, and of his relation to the Universe.  That is the whole work as we have it now.  The Second Book was to treat of Man Intellectual; the Third Book, of Man Social, including ties to Church and State; the Fourth Book, of Man Moral, was to illustrate abstract truth by sketches of character.  This part of the design is represented by the Moral Essays, of which four were written, to which was added, as a fifth, the Epistle to Addison which had been written much earlier, in 1715, and first published in 1720.  The four Moral essays are two pairs.  One pair is upon the Characters of Men and on the Characters of Women, which would have formed the opening of the subject of the Fourth Book of the Essay:  the other pair shows character expressed through a right or a wrong use of Riches:  in fact, Money and Morals.  The four Epistles were published separately.  The fourth (to the Earl of Burlington) was first published in 1731, its title then being \\\"Of Taste;\\\" the third (to Lord Bathurst) followed in 1732, the year of the publication of the first two Epistles on the \\\"Essay on Man.\\\"  In 1733, the year of publication of the Third Epistle of the \\\"Essay on Man,\\\" Pope published his Moral Essay of the \\\"Characters of Men.\\\"  in 1734 followed the Fourth Epistle of the \\\"Essay on Man;\\\" and in 1735 the \\\"Characters of Women,\\\" addressed to Martha Blount, the woman whom Pope loved, though he was withheld by a frail body from marriage.  Thus the two works were, in fact, produced together, parts of one design.\\n\\nPope's Satires, which still deal with characters of men, followed immediately, some appearing in a folio in January, 1735.  That part of the epistle to Arbuthnot forming the Prologue, which gives a character of Addison, as Atticus, had been sketched more than twelve years before, and earlier sketches of some smaller critics were introduced; but the beginning and the end, the parts in which Pope spoke of himself and of his father and mother, and his friend Dr. Arbuthnot, were written in 1733 and 1734.  Then follows an imitation of the first Epistle of the Second Book of the Satires of Horace, concerning which Pope told a friend, \\\"When I had a fever one winter in town that confined me to my room for five or six days, Lord Bolingbroke, who came to see me, happened to take up a Horace that lay on the table, and, turning it over, dropped on the first satire in the Second Book, which begins, 'Sunt, quibus in satira.'  He observed how well that would suit my case if I were to imitate it in English.  After he was gone, I read it over, translated it in a morning or two, and sent it to press in a week or a fortnight after\\\" (February, 1733).  \\\"And this was the occasion of my imitating some others of the Satires and Epistles.\\\"  The two dialogues finally used as the Epilogue to the Satires were first published in the year 1738, with the name of the year, \\\"Seventeen Hundred and Thirty-eight.\\\"  Samuel Johnson's \\\"London,\\\" his first bid for recognition, appeared in the same week, and excited in Pope not admiration only, but some active endeavour to be useful to its author.\\n\\nThe reader of Pope, as of every author, is advised to begin by letting him say what he has to say, in his own manner to an open mind that seeks only to receive the impressions which the writer wishes to convey.  First let the mind and spirit of the writer come into free, full contact with the mind and spirit of the reader, whose attitude at the first reading should be simply receptive.  Such reading is the condition precedent to all true judgment of a writer's work.  All criticism that is not so grounded spreads as fog over a poet's page.  Read, reader, for yourself, without once pausing to remember what you have been told to think.          H.M.\\n\\nPOPE'S POEMS.\\n\\nAN ESSAY ON MAN. TO H. ST. JOHN LORD BOLINGBROKE.\\n\\nTHE DESIGN.\\n\\nHaving proposed to write some pieces of Human Life and Manners, such as (to use my Lord Bacon's expression) come home to Men's Business and Bosoms, I thought it more satisfactory to begin with considering Man in the abstract, his Nature and his State; since, to prove any moral duty, to enforce any moral precept, or to examine the perfection or imperfection of any creature whatsoever, it is necessary first to know what condition and relation it is placed in, and what is the proper end and purpose of its being.\\n\\nThe science of Human Nature is, like all other sciences, reduced to a few clear points:  there are not many certain truths in this world.  It is therefore in the anatomy of the Mind as in that of the Body; more good will accrue to mankind by attending to the large, open, and perceptible parts, than by studying too much such finer nerves and vessels, the conformations and uses of which will for ever escape our observation.  The disputes are all upon these last, and, I will venture to say, they have less sharpened the wits than the hearts of men against each other, and have diminished the practice more than advanced the theory of Morality.  If I could flatter myself that this Essay has any merit, it is in steering betwixt the extremes of doctrines seemingly opposite, in passing over terms utterly unintelligible, and in forming a temperate yet not inconsistent, and a short yet not imperfect system of Ethics.\\n\\nThis I might have done in prose, but I chose verse, and even rhyme, for two reasons.  The one will appear obvious; that principles, maxims, or precepts so written, both strike the reader more strongly at first, and are more easily retained by him afterwards:  the other may seem odd, but is true, I found I could express them more shortly this way than in prose itself; and nothing is more certain, than that much of the force as well as grace of arguments or instructions depends on their conciseness.  I was unable to treat this part of my subject more in detail, without becoming dry and tedious; or more poetically, without sacrificing perspicuity to ornament, without wandering from the precision, or breaking the chain of reasoning: if any man can unite all these without diminution of any of them I freely confess he will compass a thing above my capacity.\\n\\nWhat is now published is only to be considered as a general Map of Man, marking out no more than the greater parts, their extent, their limits, and their connection, and leaving the particular to be more fully delineated in the charts which are to follow.  Consequently, these Epistles in their progress (if I have health and leisure to make any progress) will be less dry, and more susceptible of poetical ornament.  I am here only opening the fountains, and clearing the passage.  To deduce the rivers, to follow them in their course, and to observe their effects, may be a task more agreeable.  P.\\n\\nARGUMENT OF EPISTLE I.\\n\\nOF THE NATURE AND STATE OF MAN, WITH RESPECT TO THE UNIVERSE.\\n\\nOf Man in the abstract.\\n\\nI.    That we can judge only with regard to our own system, being ignorant of the relations of systems and things, v.17, etc.\\n\\nII.   That Man is not to be deemed imperfect, but a being suited to his place and rank in the Creation, agreeable to the general Order of Things, and conformable to Ends and Relations to him unknown, v.35, etc.\\n\\nIII.  That it is partly upon his ignorance of future events, and partly upon the hope of future state, that all his happiness in the present depends, v.77, etc.\\n\\nIV.   The pride of aiming at more knowledge, and pretending to more Perfection, the cause of Man's error and misery.  The impiety of putting himself in the place of God, and judging of the fitness or unfitness, perfection or imperfection, justice or injustice of His dispensations, v.109, etc.\\n\\nV.    The absurdity of conceiting himself the final cause of the Creation, or expecting that perfection in the moral world, which is not in the natural, v.131, etc.\\n\\nVI.   The unreasonableness of his complaints against Providence, while on the one hand he demands the Perfections of the Angels, and on the other the bodily qualifications of the Brutes; though to possess any of the sensitive faculties in a higher degree would render him miserable, v.173, etc.\\n\\nVII.  That throughout the whole visible world, an universal order and gradation in the sensual and mental faculties is observed, which cause is a subordination of creature to creature, and of all creatures to Man.  The gradations of sense, instinct, thought, reflection, reason; that Reason alone countervails all the other faculties, v.207.\\n\\nVIII. How much further this order and subordination of living creatures may extend, above and below us; were any part of which broken, not that part only, but the whole connected creation, must be destroyed, v.233.\\n\\nIX.   The extravagance, madness, and pride of such a desire, v.250.\\n\\nX.    The consequence of all, the absolute submission due to Providence, both as to our present and future state, v.281, etc., to the end.\\n\\nEPISTLE I.\\n\\nAwake, my St. John! leave all meaner things\\nTo low ambition, and the pride of kings.\\nLet us (since life can little more supply\\nThan just to look about us and to die)\\nExpatiate free o'er all this scene of man;\\nA mighty maze! but not without a plan;\\nA wild, where weeds and flowers promiscuous shoot;\\nOr garden tempting with forbidden fruit.\\nTogether let us beat this ample field,\\nTry what the open, what the covert yield;\\nThe latent tracts, the giddy heights, explore\\nOf all who blindly creep, or sightless soar;\\nEye Nature's walks, shoot Folly as it flies,\\nAnd catch the manners living as they rise;\\nLaugh where we must, be candid where we can;\\nBut vindicate the ways of God to man.\\n\\nI.  Say first, of God above, or man below\\nWhat can we reason, but from what we know?\\nOf man, what see we but his station here,\\nFrom which to reason, or to which refer?\\nThrough worlds unnumbered though the God be known,\\n'Tis ours to trace Him only in our own.\\nHe, who through vast immensity can pierce,\\nSee worlds on worlds compose one universe,\\nObserve how system into system runs,\\nWhat other planets circle other suns,\\nWhat varied being peoples every star,\\nMay tell why Heaven has made us as we are.\\nBut of this frame, the bearings, and the ties,\\nThe strong connections, nice dependencies,\\nGradations just, has thy pervading soul\\nLooked through? or can a part contain the whole?\\nIs the great chain, that draws all to agree,\\nAnd drawn supports, upheld by God, or thee?\\n\\nII.  Presumptuous man! the reason wouldst thou find,\\nWhy formed so weak, so little, and so blind?\\nFirst, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,\\nWhy formed no weaker, blinder, and no less;\\nAsk of thy mother earth, why oaks are made\\nTaller or stronger than the weeds they shade?\\nOr ask of yonder argent fields above,\\nWhy Jove's satellites are less than Jove?\\nOf systems possible, if 'tis confest\\nThat wisdom infinite must form the best,\\nWhere all must full or not coherent be,\\nAnd all that rises, rise in due degree;\\nThen in the scale of reasoning life, 'tis plain,\\nThere must be, somewhere, such a rank as man:\\nAnd all the question (wrangle e'er so long)\\nIs only this, if God has placed him wrong?\\nRespecting man, whatever wrong we call,\\nMay, must be right, as relative to all.\\nIn human works, though laboured on with pain,\\nA thousand movements scarce one purpose gain;\\nIn God's one single can its end produce;\\nYet serves to second too some other use.\\nSo man, who here seems principal alone,\\nPerhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,\\nTouches some wheel, or verges to some goal;\\n'Tis but a part we see, and not a whole.\\nWhen the proud steed shall know why man restrains\\nHis fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains:\\nWhen the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod,\\nIs now a victim, and now Egypt's god:\\nThen shall man's pride and dulness comprehend\\nHis actions', passions', being's, use and end;\\nWhy doing, suffering, checked, impelled; and why\\nThis hour a slave, the next a deity.\\nThen say not man's imperfect, Heaven in fault;\\nSay rather man's as perfect as he ought:\\nHis knowledge measured to his state and place;\\nHis time a moment, and a point his space.\\nIf to be perfect in a certain sphere,\\nWhat matter, soon or late, or here or there?\\nThe blest to-day is as completely so,\\nAs who began a thousand years ago.\\n\\nIII.  Heaven from all creatures hides the book of Fate,\\nAll but the page prescribed, their present state:\\nFrom brutes what men, from men what spirits know:\\nOr who could suffer being here below?\\nThe lamb thy riot dooms to bleed to-day,\\nHad he thy reason, would he skip and play?\\nPleased to the last, he crops the flowery food,\\nAnd licks the hand just raised to shed his blood.\\nOh, blindness to the future! kindly given,\\nThat each may fill the circle, marked by Heaven:\\nWho sees with equal eye, as God of all,\\nA hero perish, or a sparrow fall,\\nAtoms or systems into ruin hurled,\\nAnd now a bubble burst, and now a world.\\nHope humbly, then; with trembling pinions soar;\\nWait the great teacher Death; and God adore.\\nWhat future bliss, He gives not thee to know,\\nBut gives that hope to be thy blessing now.\\nHope springs eternal in the human breast:\\nMan never is, but always to be blest:\\nThe soul, uneasy and confined from home,\\nRests and expatiates in a life to come.\\nLo, the poor Indian! whose untutored mind\\nSees God in clouds, or hears Him in the wind;\\nHis soul, proud science never taught to stray\\nFar as the solar walk, or milky way;\\nYet simple Nature to his hope has given,\\nBehind the cloud-topped hill, an humbler heaven;\\nSome safer world in depth of woods embraced,\\nSome happier island in the watery waste,\\nWhere slaves once more their native land behold,\\nNo fiends torment, no Christians thirst for gold.\\nTo be, contents his natural desire,\\nHe asks no angel's wing, no seraph's fire;\\nBut thinks, admitted to that equal sky,\\nHis faithful dog shall bear him company.\\n\\nIV.  Go, wiser thou! and, in thy scale of sense,\\nWeigh thy opinion against providence;\\nCall imperfection what thou fanciest such,\\nSay, here He gives too little, there too much;\\nDestroy all creatures for thy sport or gust,\\nYet cry, if man's unhappy, God's unjust;\\nIf man alone engross not Heaven's high care,\\nAlone made perfect here, immortal there:\\nSnatch from His hand the balance and the rod,\\nRe-judge His justice, be the God of God.\\nIn pride, in reasoning pride, our error lies;\\nAll quit their sphere, and rush into the skies.\\nPride still is aiming at the blest abodes,\\nMen would be angels, angels would be gods.\\nAspiring to be gods, if angels fell,\\nAspiring to be angels, men rebel:\\nAnd who but wishes to invert the laws\\nOf order, sins against the Eternal Cause.\\n\\nV.  Ask for what end the heavenly bodies shine,\\nEarth for whose use?  Pride answers, \\\"'Tis for mine:\\nFor me kind Nature wakes her genial power,\\nSuckles each herb, and spreads out every flower;\\nAnnual for me, the grape, the rose renew\\nThe juice nectareous, and the balmy dew;\\nFor me, the mine a thousand treasures brings;\\nFor me, health gushes from a thousand springs;\\nSeas roll to waft me, suns to light me rise;\\nMy footstool earth, my canopy the skies.\\\"\\nBut errs not Nature from this gracious end,\\nFrom burning suns when livid deaths descend,\\nWhen earthquakes swallow, or when tempests sweep\\nTowns to one grave, whole nations to the deep?\\n\\\"No, ('tis replied) the first Almighty Cause\\nActs not by partial, but by general laws;\\nThe exceptions few; some change since all began;\\nAnd what created perfect?\\\" -- Why then man?\\nIf the great end be human happiness,\\nThen Nature deviates; and can man do less?\\nAs much that end a constant course requires\\nOf showers and sunshine, as of man's desires;\\nAs much eternal springs and cloudless skies,\\nAs men for ever temperate, calm, and wise.\\nIf plagues or earthquakes break not Heaven's design,\\nWhy then a Borgia, or a Catiline?\\nWho knows but He, whose hand the lightning forms,\\nWho heaves old ocean, and who wings the storms;\\nPours fierce ambition in a Caesar's mind,\\nOr turns young Ammon loose to scourge mankind?\\nFrom pride, from pride, our very reasoning springs;\\nAccount for moral, as for natural things:\\nWhy charge we heaven in those, in these acquit?\\nIn both, to reason right is to submit.\\nBetter for us, perhaps, it might appear,\\nWere there all harmony, all virtue here;\\nThat never air or ocean felt the wind;\\nThat never passion discomposed the mind.\\nBut all subsists by elemental strife;\\nAnd passions are the elements of life.\\nThe general order, since the whole began,\\nIs kept in nature, and is kept in man.\\n\\nVI.  What would this man?  Now upward will he soar,\\nAnd little less than angel, would be more;\\nNow looking downwards, just as grieved appears\\nTo want the strength of bulls, the fur of bears\\nMade for his use all creatures if he call,\\nSay what their use, had he the powers of all?\\nNature to these, without profusion, kind,\\nThe proper organs, proper powers assigned;\\nEach seeming want compensated of course,\\nHere with degrees of swiftness, there of force;\\nAll in exact proportion to the state;\\nNothing to add, and nothing to abate.\\nEach beast, each insect, happy in its own:\\nIs Heaven unkind to man, and man alone?\\nShall he alone, whom rational we call,\\nBe pleased with nothing, if not blessed with all?\\nThe bliss of man (could pride that blessing find)\\nIs not to act or think beyond mankind;\\nNo powers of body or of soul to share,\\nBut what his nature and his state can bear.\\nWhy has not man a microscopic eye?\\nFor this plain reason, man is not a fly.\\nSay what the use, were finer optics given,\\nTo inspect a mite, not comprehend the heaven?\\nOr touch, if tremblingly alive all o'er,\\nTo smart and agonize at every pore?\\nOr quick effluvia darting through the brain,\\nDie of a rose in aromatic pain?\\nIf Nature thundered in his opening ears,\\nAnd stunned him with the music of the spheres,\\nHow would he wish that Heaven had left him still\\nThe whispering zephyr, and the purling rill?\\nWho finds not Providence all good and wise,\\nAlike in what it gives, and what denies?\\n\\nVII.  Far as Creation's ample range extends,\\nThe scale of sensual, mental powers ascends:\\nMark how it mounts, to man's imperial race,\\nFrom the green myriads in the peopled grass:\\nWhat modes of sight betwixt each wide extreme,\\nThe mole's dim curtain, and the lynx's beam:\\nOf smell, the headlong lioness between,\\nAnd hound sagacious on the tainted green:\\nOf hearing, from the life that fills the flood,\\nTo that which warbles through the vernal wood:\\nThe spider's touch, how exquisitely fine!\\nFeels at each thread, and lives along the line:\\nIn the nice bee, what sense so subtly true\\nFrom poisonous herbs extracts the healing dew?\\nHow instinct varies in the grovelling swine,\\nCompared, half-reasoning elephant, with thine!\\n'Twixt that, and reason, what a nice barrier,\\nFor ever separate, yet for ever near!\\nRemembrance and reflection how allayed;\\nWhat thin partitions sense from thought divide:\\nAnd middle natures, how they long to join,\\nYet never passed the insuperable line!\\nWithout this just gradation, could they be\\nSubjected, these to those, or all to thee?\\nThe powers of all subdued by thee alone,\\nIs not thy reason all these powers in one?\\n\\nVIII.  See, through this air, this ocean, and this earth,\\nAll matter quick, and bursting into birth.\\nAbove, how high, progressive life may go!\\nAround, how wide! how deep extend below?\\nVast chain of being! which from God began,\\nNatures ethereal, human, angel, man,\\nBeast, bird, fish, insect, what no eye can see,\\nNo glass can reach; from Infinite to thee,\\nFrom thee to nothing.  On superior powers\\nWere we to press, inferior might on ours:\\nOr in the full creation leave a void,\\nWhere, one step broken, the great scale's destroyed:\\nFrom Nature's chain whatever link you strike,\\nTenth or ten thousandth, breaks the chain alike.\\nAnd, if each system in gradation roll\\nAlike essential to the amazing whole,\\nThe least confusion but in one, not all\\nThat system only, but the whole must fall.\\nLet earth unbalanced from her orbit fly,\\nPlanets and suns run lawless through the sky;\\nLet ruling angels from their spheres be hurled,\\nBeing on being wrecked, and world on world;\\nHeaven's whole foundations to their centre nod,\\nAnd nature tremble to the throne of God.\\nAll this dread order break -- for whom? for thee?\\nVile worm! -- Oh, madness! pride! impiety!\\n\\nIX.  What if the foot, ordained the dust to tread,\\nOr hand, to toil, aspired to be the head?\\nWhat if the head, the eye, or ear repined\\nTo serve mere engines to the ruling mind?\\nJust as absurd for any part to claim\\nTo be another, in this general frame:\\nJust as absurd, to mourn the tasks or pains,\\nThe great directing Mind of All ordains.\\nAll are but parts of one stupendous whole,\\nWhose body Nature is, and God the soul;\\nThat, changed through all, and yet in all the same;\\nGreat in the earth, as in the ethereal frame;\\nWarms in the sun, refreshes in the breeze,\\nGlows in the stars, and blossoms in the trees,\\nLives through all life, extends through all extent,\\nSpreads undivided, operates unspent;\\nBreathes in our soul, informs our mortal part,\\nAs full, as perfect, in a hair as heart:\\nAs full, as perfect, in vile man that mourns,\\nAs the rapt seraph that adores and burns:\\nTo him no high, no low, no great, no small;\\nHe fills, he bounds, connects, and equals all.\\n\\nX.  Cease, then, nor order imperfection name:\\nOur proper bliss depends on what we blame.\\nKnow thy own point:  this kind, this due degree\\nOf blindness, weakness, Heaven bestows on thee.\\nSubmit.  In this, or any other sphere,\\nSecure to be as blest as thou canst bear:\\nSafe in the hand of one disposing Power,\\nOr in the natal, or the mortal hour.\\nAll nature is but art, unknown to thee;\\nAll chance, direction, which thou canst not see;\\nAll discord, harmony not understood;\\nAll partial evil, universal good:\\nAnd, spite of pride in erring reason's spite,\\nOne truth is clear, whatever is, is right.\",\"timestamp\":1639290938,\"title\":\"\\nPope's life as a writer falls into three periods, answering fairly enough to the three reigns in which he worked.  \"},\"digest\":\"eNZnfCr54gnGDk7dGIN8wHV5CM9dnrVvWGDHqyaVid8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x78E122EE80026e3069E79387D188d772001055Aa\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JjJHJRKpmlgqaQr0DNNo0OOgUoDXtoe0UanX0mNtZ68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dS-fUZlFjOcc9kBdY2UYEMYjIFFl6FroEiNHaqxKxko\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5ImTbb98gmyXvWCwMHGX9LuDO-vyanbA84dXkbPFgh0d30A2JIVZ4E1T1ESdBO0YGNYDspfxoVjbaOfJSQeZlg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x18ab47b1c280d958bc9905e4cc36a220d5ffb59add1717e77d82691c47e0df8f002bbb5242cbf72d27d177f5bbe0e01dd1ca3d8153022713560355b2aa76160e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JjJHJRKpmlgqaQr0DNNo0OOgUoDXtoe0UanX0mNtZ68\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dS-fUZlFjOcc9kBdY2UYEMYjIFFl6FroEiNHaqxKxko\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eNZnfCr54gnGDk7dGIN8wHV5CM9dnrVvWGDHqyaVid8\"}"
