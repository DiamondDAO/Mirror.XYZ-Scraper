"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"logs and bodies, bodies, bodies.  The fisherman and his son put me and my luggage into their dugout made from an aspen tree and poled upstream along the bank.  Poling in a swift current is very hard work.  At the sharp curves we were compelled to row, struggling against the force of the stream and even in places hugging the cliffs and making headway only by clutching the rocks with our hands and dragging along slowly.  Sometimes it took us a long while to do five or six metres through these rapid holes.  In two days we reached the goal of our journey.  I spent several days in this gold mine, where the watchman and his family were living.  As they were short of food, they had nothing to spare for me and consequently my rifle again served to nourish me, as well as contributing something to my hosts.  One day there appeared here a trained agriculturalist.  I did not hide because during my winter in the woods I had raised a heavy beard, so that probably my own mother could not have recognized me.  However, our guest was very shrewd and at once deciphered me.  I did not fear him because I saw that he was not a Bolshevik and later had confirmation of this.  We found common acquaintances and a common viewpoint on current events.  He lived close to the gold mine in a small village where he superintended public works.  We determined to escape together from Russia.  For a long time I had puzzled over this matter and now my plan was ready.  Knowing the position in Siberia and its geography, I decided that the best way to safety was through Urianhai, the northern part of Mongolia on the head waters of the Yenisei, then through Mongolia and out to the Far East and the Pacific.  Before the overthrow of the Kolchak Government I had received a commission to investigate Urianhai and Western Mongolia and then, with great accuracy, I studied all the maps and literature I could get on this question.  To accomplish this audacious plan I had the great incentive of my own safety.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nTHROUGH SOVIET SIBERIA\\n\\nAfter several days we started through the forest on the left bank of the Yenisei toward the south, avoiding the villages as much as possible in fear of leaving some trail by which we might be followed.  Whenever we did have to go into them, we had a good reception at the hands of the peasants, who did not penetrate our disguise; and we saw that they hated the Bolsheviki, who had destroyed many of their villages.  In one place we were told that a detachment of Red troops had been sent out from Minnusinsk to chase the Whites.  We were forced to work far back from the shore of the Yenisei and to hide in the woods and mountains.  Here we remained nearly a fortnight, because all this time the Red soldiers were traversing the country and capturing in the woods half-dressed unarmed officers who were in hiding from the atrocious vengeance of the Bolsheviki.  Afterwards by accident we passed a meadow where we found the bodies of twenty-eight officers hung to the trees, with their faces and bodies mutilated.  There we determined never to allow ourselves to come alive into the hands of the Boisheviki.  To prevent this we had our weapons and a supply of cyanide of potassium.\\n\\nPassing across one branch of the Yenisei, once we saw a narrow, miry pass, the entrance to which was strewn with the bodies of men and horses.  A little farther along we found a broken sleigh with rifled boxes and papers scattered about.  Near them were also torn garments and bodies.  Who were these pitiful ones?  What tragedy was staged in this wild wood?  We tried to guess this enigma and we began to investigate the documents and papers.  These were official papers addressed to the Staff of General Pepelaieff.  Probably one part of the Staff during the retreat of Kolchak's army went through this wood, striving to hide from the enemy approaching from all sides; but here they were caught by the Reds and killed.  Not far from here we found the body of a poor unfortunate woman, whose condition proved clearly what had happened before relief came through the beneficent bullet.  The body lay beside a shelter of branches, strewn with bottles and conserve tins, telling the tale of the bantering feast that had preceded the destruction of this life.\\n\\nThe further we went to the south, the more pronouncedly hospitable the people became toward us and the more hostile to the Bolsheviki. At last we emerged from the forests and entered the spacious vastness of the Minnusinsk steppes, crossed by the high red mountain range called the \\\"Kizill-Kaiya\\\" and dotted here and there with salt lakes.  It is a country of tombs, thousands of large and small dolmens, the tombs of the earliest proprietors of this land: pyramids of stone ten metres high, the marks set by Jenghiz Khan along his road of conquest and afterwards by the cripple Tamerlane- Temur.  Thousands of these dolmens and stone pyramids stretch in endless rows to the north.  In these plains the Tartars now live. They were robbed by the Bolsheviki and therefore hated them ardently.  We openly told them that we were escaping.  They gave us food for nothing and supplied us with guides, telling us with whom we might stop and where to hide in case of danger.\\n\\nAfter several days we looked down from the high bank of the Yenisei upon the first steamer, the \\\"Oriol,\\\" from Krasnoyarsk to Minnusinsk, laden with Red soldiers.  Soon we came to the mouth of the river Tuba, which we were to follow straight east to the Sayan mountains, where Urianhai begins.  We thought the stage along the Tuba and its branch, the Amyl, the most dangerous part of our course, because the valleys of these two rivers had a dense population which had contributed large numbers of soldiers to the celebrated Communist Partisans, Schetinkin and Krafcheno.\\n\\nA Tartar ferried us and our horses over to the right bank of the Yenisei and afterwards sent us some Cossacks at daybreak who guided us to the mouth of the Tuba, where we spent the whole day in rest, gratifying ourselves with a feast of wild black currants and cherries.\\n\\nCHAPTER VIII\\n\\nTHREE DAYS ON THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE\\n\\nArmed with our false passports, we moved along up the valley of the Tuba.  Every ten or fifteen versts we came across large villages of from one to six hundred houses, where all administration was in the hands of Soviets and where spies scrutinized all passers-by.  We could not avoid these villages for two reasons.  First, our attempts to avoid them when we were constantly meeting the peasants in the country would have aroused suspicion and would have caused any Soviet to arrest us and send us to the \\\"Cheka\\\" in Minnusinsk, where we should have sung our last song.  Secondly, in his documents my fellow traveler was granted permission to use the government post relays for forwarding him on his journey. Therefore, we were forced to visit the village Soviets and change our horses.  Our own mounts we had given to the Tartar and Cossack who helped us at the mouth of the Tuba, and the Cossack brought us in his wagon to the first village, where we received the post horses.  All except a small minority of the peasants were against the Bolsheviki and voluntarily assisted us.  I paid them for their help by treating their sick and my fellow traveler gave them practical advice in the management of their agriculture.  Those who helped us chiefly were the old dissenters and the Cossacks.\\n\\nSometimes we came across villages entirely Communistic but very soon we learned to distinguish them.  When we entered a village with our horse bells tinkling and found the peasants who happened to be sitting in front of their houses ready to get up with a frown and a grumble that here were more new devils coming, we knew that this was a village opposed to the Communists and that here we could stop in safety.  But, if the peasants approached and greeted us with pleasure, calling us \\\"Comrades,\\\" we knew at once that we were among the enemy and took great precautions.  Such villages were inhabited by people who were not the Siberian liberty-loving peasants but by emigrants from the Ukraine, idle and drunk, living in poor dirty huts, though their village were surrounded with the black and fertile soil of the steppes.  Very dangerous and pleasant moments we spent in the large village of Karatuz.  It is rather a town.  In the year 1912 two colleges were opened here and the population reached 15,000 people.  It is the capital of the South Yenisei Cossacks.  But by now it is very difficult to recognize this town.  The peasant emigrants and Red army murdered all the Cossack population and destroyed and burned most of the houses; and it is at present the center of Bolshevism and Communism in the eastern part of the Minnusinsk district.  In the building of the Soviet, where we came to exchange our horses, there was being held a meeting of the \\\"Cheka.\\\"  We were immediately surrounded and questioned about our documents.  We were not any too calm about the impression which might be made by our papers and attempted to avoid this examination.  My fellow traveler afterwards often said to me:\\n\\n\\\"It is great good fortune that among the Bolsheviki the good-for- nothing shoemaker of yesterday is the Governor of today and scientists sweep the streets or clean the stables of the Red cavalry.  I can talk with the Bolsheviki because they do not know the difference between 'disinfection' and 'diphtheria,' 'anthracite' and 'appendicitis' and can talk them round in all things, even up to persuading them not to put a bullet into me.\\\"\\n\\nAnd so we talked the members of the \\\"Cheka\\\" round to everything that we wanted.  We presented to them a bright scheme for the future development of their district, when we would build the roads and bridges which would allow them to export the wood from Urianhai, iron and gold from the Sayan Mountains, cattle and furs from Mongolia.  What a triumph of creative work for the Soviet Government!  Our ode occupied about an hour and afterwards the members of the \\\"Cheka,\\\" forgetting about our documents, personally changed our horses, placed our luggage on the wagon and wished us success.  It was the last ordeal within the borders of Russia.\\n\\nWhen we had crossed the valley of the river Amyl, Happiness smiled on us.  Near the ferry we met a member of the militia from Karatuz. He had on his wagon several rifles and automatic pistols, mostly Mausers, for outfitting an expedition through Urianhai in quest of some Cossack officers who had been greatly troubling the Bolsheviki.  We stood upon our guard.  We could very easily have met this expedition and we were not quite assured that the soldiers would be so appreciative of our high-sounding phrases as were the members of the \\\"Cheka.\\\"  Carefully questioning the militiaman, we ferreted out the route their expedition was to take.  In the next village we stayed in the same house with him.  I had to open my luggage and suddenly I noticed his admiring glance fixed upon my bag.\\n\\n\\\"What pleases you so much?\\\" I asked.\\n\\nHe whispered:  \\\"Trousers . . . Trousers.\\\"\\n\\nI had received from my townsmen quite new trousers of black thick cloth for riding.  Those trousers attracted the rapt attention of the militiaman.\\n\\n\\\"If you have no other trousers. . . .\\\" I remarked, reflecting upon my plan of attack against my new friend.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" he explained with sadness, \\\"the Soviet does not furnish trousers.  They tell me they also go without trousers.  And my trousers are absolutely worn out.  Look at them.\\\"\\n\\nWith these words he threw back the corner of his overcoat and I was astonished how he could keep himself inside these trousers, for they had such large holes that they were more of a net than trousers, a net through which a small shark could have slipped.\\n\\n\\\"Sell me,\\\" he whispered, with a question in his voice.\\n\\n\\\"I cannot, for I need them myself,\\\" I answered decisively.\\n\\nHe reflected for a few minutes and afterward, approaching me, said: \\\"Let us go out doors and talk.  Here it is inconvenient.\\\"\\n\\nWe went outside.  \\\"Now, what about it?\\\" he began.  \\\"You are going into Urianhai.  There the Soviet bank-notes have no value and you will not be able to buy anything, where there are plenty of sables, fox-skins, ermine and gold dust to be purchased, which they very willingly exchange for rifles and cartridges.  You have each of you a rifle and I will give you one more rifle with a hundred cartridges if you give me the trousers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We do not need weapons.  We are protected by our documents,\\\" I answered, as though I did not understand.\\n\\n\\\"But no,\\\" he interrupted, \\\"you can change that rifle there into furs and gold.  I shall give you that rifle outright.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, that's it, is it?  But it's very little for those trousers. Nowhere in Russia can you now find trousers.  All Russia goes without trousers and for your rifle I should receive a sable and what use to me is one skin?\\\"\\n\\nWord by word I attained to my desire.  The militia-man got my trousers and I received a rifle with one hundred cartridges and two automatic pistols with forty cartridges each.  We were armed now so that we could defend ourselves.  Moreover, I persuaded the happy possessor of my trousers to give us a permit to carry the weapons. Then the law and force were both on our side.\\n\\nIn a distant village we bought three horses, two for riding and one for packing, engaged a guide, purchased dried bread, meat, salt and butter and, after resting twenty-four hours, began our trip up the Amyl toward the Sayan Mountains on the border of Urianhai.  There we hoped not to meet Bolsheviki, either sly or silly.  In three days from the mouth of the Tuba we passed the last Russian village near the Mongolian-Urianhai border, three days of constant contact with a lawless population, of continuous danger and of the ever present possibility of fortuitous death.  Only iron will power, presence of mind and dogged tenacity brought us through all the dangers and saved us from rolling back down our precipice of adventure, at whose foot lay so many others who had failed to make this same climb to freedom which we had just accomplished.  Perhaps they lacked the persistence or the presence of mind, perhaps they had not the poetic ability to sing odes about \\\"roads, bridges and gold mines\\\" or perhaps they simply had no spare trousers.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX\\n\\nTO THE SAYANS AND SAFETY\\n\\nDense virgin wood surrounded us.  In the high, already yellow grass the trail wound hardly noticeable in among bushes and trees just beginning to drop their many colored leaves.  It is the old, already forgotten Amyl pass road.  Twenty-five years ago it carried the provisions, machinery and workers for the numerous, now abandoned, gold mines of the Amyl valley.  The road now wound along the wide and rapid Amyl, then penetrated into the deep forest, guiding us round the swampy ground filled with those dangerous Siberian quagmires, through the dense bushes, across mountains and wide meadows.  Our guide probably did not surmise our real intention and sometimes, apprehensively looking down at the ground, would say:\\n\\n\\\"Three riders on horses with shoes on have passed here.  Perhaps they were soldiers.\\\"\\n\\nHis anxiety was terminated when he discovered that the tracks led off to one side and then returned to the trail.\\n\\n\\\"They did not proceed farther,\\\" he remarked, slyly smiling.\\n\\n\\\"That's too bad,\\\" we answered.  \\\"It would have been more lively to travel in company.\\\"\\n\\nBut the peasant only stroked his beard and laughed.  Evidently he was not taken in by our statement.\\n\\nWe passed on the way a gold mine that had been formerly planned and equipped on splendid lines but was now abandoned and the buildings all destroyed.  The Bolsheviki had taken away the machinery, supplies and also some parts of the buildings.  Nearby stood a dark and gloomy church with windows broken, the crucifix torn off and the tower burned, a pitifully typical emblem of the Russia of today.  The starving family of the watchman lived at the mine in continuing danger and privation.  They told us that in this forest region were wandering about a band of Reds who were robbing anything that remained on the property of the gold mine, were working the pay dirt in the richest part of the mine and, with a little gold washed, were going to drink and gamble it away in some distant villages where the peasants were making the forbidden vodka out of berries and potatoes and selling it for its weight in gold. A meeting with this band meant death.  After three days we crossed the northern ridge of the Sayan chain, passed the border river Algiak and, after this day, were abroad in the territory of Urianhai.\\n\\nThis wonderful land, rich in most diverse forms of natural wealth, is inhabited by a branch of the Mongols, which is now only sixty thousand and which is gradually dying off, speaking a language quite different from any of the other dialects of this folk and holding as their life ideal the tenet of \\\"Eternal Peace.\\\"  Urianhai long ago became the scene of administrative attempts by Russians, Mongols and Chinese, all of whom claimed sovereignty over the region whose unfortunate inhabitants, the Soyots, had to pay tribute to all three of these overlords.  It was due to this that the land was not an entirely safe refuge for us.  We had heard already from our militiaman about the expedition preparing to go into Urianhai and from the peasants we learned that the villages along the Little Yenisei and farther south had formed Red detachments, who were robbing and killing everyone who fell into their hands.  Recently they had killed sixty-two officers attempting to pass Urianhai into Mongolia; robbed and killed a caravan of Chinese merchants; and killed some German war prisoners who escaped from the Soviet paradise.  On the fourth day we reached a swampy valley where, among open forests, stood a single Russian house.  Here we took leave of our guide, who hastened away to get back before the snows should block his road over the Sayans.  The master of the establishment agreed to guide us to the Seybi River for ten thousand roubles in Soviet notes.  Our horses were tired and we were forced to give them a rest, so we decided to spend twenty-four hours here.\\n\\nWe were drinking tea when the daughter of our host cried:\\n\\n\\\"The Soyots are coming!\\\"  Into the room with their rifles and pointed hats came suddenly four of them.\\n\\n\\\"Mende,\\\" they grunted to us and then, without ceremony, began examining us critically.  Not a button or a seam in our entire outfit escaped their penetrating gaze.  Afterwards one of them, who appeared to be the local \\\"Merin\\\" or governor, began to investigate our political views.  Listening to our criticisms of the Bolsheviki, he was evidently pleased and began talking freely.\\n\\n\\\"You are good people.  You do not like Bolsheviki.  We will help you.\\\"\\n\\nI thanked him and presented him with the thick silk cord which I was wearing as a girdle.  Before night they left us saying that they would return in the morning.  It grew dark.  We went to the meadow to look after our exhausted horses grazing there and came back to the house.  We were gaily chatting with the hospitable host when suddenly we heard horses' hoofs in the court and raucous voices, followed by the immediate entry of five Red soldiers armed with rifles and swords.  Something unpleasant and cold rolled up into my throat and my heart hammered.  We knew the Reds as our enemies.  These men had the red stars on their Astrakhan caps and red triangles on their sleeves.  They were members of the detachment that was out to look for Cossack officers.  Scowling at us they took off their overcoats and sat down.  We first opened the conversation, explaining the purpose of our journey in exploring for bridges, roads and gold mines.  From them we then learned that their commander would arrive in a little while with seven more men and that they would take our host at once as a guide to the Seybi River, where they thought the Cossack officers must be hidden. Immediately I remarked that our affairs were moving fortunately and that we must travel along together.  One of the soldiers replied that that would depend upon the \\\"Comrade-officer.\\\"\\n\\nDuring our conversation the Soyot Governor entered.  Very attentively he studied again the new arrivals and then asked:  \\\"Why did you take from the Soyots the good horses and leave bad ones?\\\"\\n\\nThe soldiers laughed at him.\\n\\n\\\"Remember that you are in a foreign country!\\\" answered the Soyot, with a threat in his voice.\\n\\n\\\"God and the Devil!\\\" cried one of the soldiers.\\n\\nBut the Soyot very calmly took a seat at the table and accepted the cup of tea the hostess was preparing for him.  The conversation ceased.  The Soyot finished the tea, smoked his long pipe and, standing up, said:\\n\\n\\\"If tomorrow morning the horses are not back at the owner's, we shall come and take them.\\\"  And with these words he turned and went out.\\n\\nI noticed an expression of apprehension on the faces of the soldiers.  Shortly one was sent out as a messenger while the others sat silent with bowed heads.  Late in the night the officer arrived with his other seven men.  As he received the report about the Soyot, he knitted his brows and said:\\n\\n\\\"It's a bad mess.  We must travel through the swamp where a Soyot will be behind every mound watching us.\\\"\\n\\nHe seemed really very anxious and his trouble fortunately prevented him from paying much attention to us.  I began to calm him and promised on the morrow to arrange this matter with the Soyots.  The officer was a coarse brute and a silly man, desiring strongly to be promoted for the capture of the Cossack officers, and feared that the Soyot could prevent him from reaching the Seybi.\\n\\nAt daybreak we started together with the Red detachment.  When we had made about fifteen kilometers, we discovered behind the bushes two riders.  They were Soyots.  On their backs were their flint rifles.\\n\\n\\\"Wait for me!\\\" I said to the officer.  \\\"I shall go for a parley with them.\\\"\\n\\nI went forward with all the speed of my horse.  One of the horsemen was the Soyot Governor, who said to me:\\n\\n\\\"Remain behind the detachment and help us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" I answered, \\\"but let us talk a little, in order that they may think we are parleying.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a moment I shook the hand of the Soyot and returned to the soldiers.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" I exclaimed, \\\"we can continue our journey.  No hindrance will come from the Soyots.\\\"\\n\\nWe moved forward and, when we were crossing a large meadow, we espied at a long distance two Soyots riding at full gallop right up the side of a mountain.  Step by step I accomplished the necessary manoeuvre to bring me and my fellow traveler somewhat behind the detachment.  Behind our backs remained only one soldier, very brutish in appearance and apparently very hostile to us.  I had time to whisper to my companion only one word: \\\"Mauser,\\\" and saw that he very carefully unbuttoned the saddle bag and drew out a little the handle of his pistol.\\n\\nSoon I understood why these soldiers, excellent woodsmen as they were, would not attempt to go to the Seybi without a guide.  All the country between the Algiak and the Seybi is formed by high and narrow mountain ridges separated by deep swampy valleys.  It is a cursed and dangerous place.  At first our horses mired to the knees, lunging about and catching their feet in the roots of bushes in the quagmires, then falling and pinning us under their sides, breaking parts of their saddles and bridles.  Then we would go in up to the riders' knees.  My horse went down once with his whole breast and head under the red fluid mud and we just saved it and no more.  Afterwards the officer's horse fell with him so that he bruised his head on a stone.  My companion injured one knee against a tree.  Some of the men also fell and were injured.  The horses breathed heavily.  Somewhere dimly and gloomily a crow cawed. Later the road became worse still.  The trail followed through the same miry swamp but everywhere the road was blocked with fallen tree trunks.  The horses, jumping over the trunks, would land in an unexpectedly deep hole and flounder.  We and all the soldiers were covered with blood and mud and were in great fear of exhausting our mounts.  For a long distance we had to get down and lead them.  At last we entered a broad meadow covered with bushes and bordered with rocks.  Not only horses but riders also began to sink to their middle in a quagmire with apparently no bottom.  The whole surface of the meadow was but a thin layer of turf, covering a lake with black putrefying water.  When we finally learned to open our column and proceed at big intervals, we found we could keep on this surface that undulated like rubber ice and swayed the bushes up and down.  In places the earth buckled up and broke.\\n\\nSuddenly, three shots sounded.  They were hardly more than the report of a Flobert rifle; but they were genuine shots, because the officer and two soldiers fell to the ground.  The other soldiers grabbed their rifles and, with fear, looked about for the enemy. Four more were soon unseated and suddenly I noticed our rearguard brute raise his rifle and aim right at me.  However, my Mauser outstrode his rifle and I was allowed to continue my story.\\n\\n\\\"Begin!\\\" I cried to my friend and we took part in the shooting. Soon the meadow began to swarm with Soyots, stripping the fallen, dividing the spoils and recapturing their horses.  In some forms of warfare it is never safe to leave any of the enemy to renew hostilities later with overwhelming forces.\\n\\nAfter an hour of very difficult road we began to ascend the mountain and soon arrived on a high plateau covered with trees.\\n\\n\\\"After all, Soyots are not a too peaceful people,\\\" I remarked, approaching the Governor.\\n\\nHe looked at me very sharply and replied:\\n\\n\\\"It was not Soyots who did the killing.\\\"\\n\\nHe was right.  It was the Abakan Tartars in Soyot clothes who killed the Bolsheviki.  These Tartars were running their herds of cattle and horses down out of Russia through Urianhai to Mongolia. They had as their guide and negotiator a Kalmuck Lamaite.  The following morning we were approaching a small settlement of Russian colonists and noticed some horsemen looking out from the woods. One of our young and brave Tartars galloped off at full speed toward these men in the wood but soon wheeled and returned with a reassuring smile.\\n\\n\\\"All right,\\\" he exclaimed, laughing, \\\"keep right on.\\\"\\n\\nWe continued our travel on a good broad road along a high wooden fence surrounding a meadow filled with a fine herd of wapiti or izubr, which the Russian colonists breed for the horns that are so valuable in the velvet for sale to Tibetan and Chinese medicine dealers.  These horns, when boiled and dried, are called panti and are sold to the Chinese at very high prices.\\n\\nWe were received with great fear by the settlers.\\n\\n\\\"Thank God!\\\" exclaimed the hostess, \\\"we thought. . .\\\" and she broke off, looking at her husband.\\n\\nCHAPTER X\\n\\nTHE BATTLE ON THE SEYBI\\n\\nConstant dangers develop one's watchfulness and keenness of perception.  We did not take off our clothes nor unsaddle our horses, tired as we were.  I put my Mauser inside my coat and began to look about and scrutinize the people.  The first thing I discovered was the butt end of a rifle under the pile of pillows always found on the peasants' large beds.  Later I noticed the employees of our host constantly coming into the room for orders from him.  They did not look like simple peasants, although they had long beards and were dressed very dirtily.  They examined me with very attentive eyes and did not leave me and my friend alone with the host.  We could not, however, make out anything.  But then the Soyot Governor came in and, noticing our strained relations, began explaining in the Soyot language to the host all about us.\\n\\n\\\"I beg your pardon,\\\" the colonist said, \\\"but you know yourself that now for one honest man we have ten thousand murderers and robbers.\\\"\\n\\nWith this we began chatting more freely.  It appeared that our host knew that a band of Bolsheviki would attack him in the search for the band of Cossack officers who were living in his house on and off.  He had heard also about the \\\"total loss\\\" of one detachment. However, it did not entirely calm the old man to have our news, for he had heard of the large detachment of Reds that was coming from the border of the Usinsky District in pursuit of the Tartars who were escaping with their cattle south to Mongolia.\\n\\n\\\"From one minute to another we are awaiting them with fear,\\\" said our host to me.  \\\"My Soyot has come in and announced that the Reds are already crossing the Seybi and the Tartars are prepared for the fight.\\\"\\n\\nWe immediately went out to look over our saddles and packs and then took the horses and hid them in the bushes not far off.  We made ready our rifles and pistols and took posts in the enclosure to wait for our common enemy.  An hour of trying impatience passed, when one of the workmen came running in from the wood and whispered:\\n\\n\\\"They are crossing our swamp. . . .  The fight is on.\\\"\\n\\nIn fact, like an answer to his words, came through the woods the sound of a single rifle-shot, followed closely by the increasing rat-tat-tat of the mingled guns.  Nearer to the house the sounds gradually came.  Soon we heard the beating of the horses' hoofs and the brutish cries of the soldiers.  In a moment three of them burst into the house, from off the road where they were being raked now by the Tartars from both directions, cursing violently.  One of them shot at our host.  He stumbled along and fell on his knee, as his hand reached out toward the rifle under his pillows.\\n\\n\\\"Who are YOU?\\\" brutally blurted out one of the soldiers, turning to us and raising his rifle.  We answered with Mausers and successfully, for only one soldier in the rear by the door escaped, and that merely to fall into the hands of a workman in the courtyard who strangled him.  The fight had begun.  The soldiers called on their comrades for help.  The Reds were strung along in the ditch at the side of the road, three hundred paces from the house, returning the fire of the surrounding Tartars.  Several soldiers ran to the house to help their comrades but this time we heard the regular volley of the workmen of our host.  They fired as though in a manoeuvre calmly and accurately.  Five Red soldiers lay on the road, while the rest now kept to their ditch.  Before long we discovered that they began crouching and crawling out toward the end of the ditch nearest the wood where they had left their horses. The sounds of shots became more and more distant and soon we saw fifty or sixty Tartars pursuing the Reds across the meadow.\\n\\nTwo days we rested here on the Seybi.  The workmen of our host, eight in number, turned out to be officers hiding from the Bolsheviks.  They asked permission to go on with us, to which we agreed.\\n\\nWhen my friend and I continued our trip we had a guard of eight armed officers and three horses with packs.  We crossed a beautiful valley between the Rivers Seybi and Ut.  Everywhere we saw splendid grazing lands with numerous herds upon them, but in two or three houses along the road we did not find anyone living.  All had hidden away in fear after hearing the sounds of the fight with the Reds.  The following day we went up over the high chain of mountains called Daban and, traversing a great area of burned timber where our trail lay among the fallen trees, we began to descend into a valley hidden from us by the intervening foothills. There behind these hills flowed the Little Yenisei, the last large river before reaching Mongolia proper.  About ten kilometers from the river we spied a column of smoke rising up out of the wood. Two of the officers slipped away to make an investigation.  For a long time they did not return and we, fearful lest something had happened, moved off carefully in the direction of the smoke, all ready for a fight if necessary.  We finally came near enough to hear the voices of many people and among them the loud laugh of one of our scouts.  In the middle of a meadow we made out a large tent with two tepees of branches and around these a crowd of fifty or sixty men.  When we broke out of the forest all of them rushed forward with a joyful welcome for us.  It appeared that it was a large camp of Russian officers and soldiers who, after their escape from Siberia, had lived in the houses of the Russian colonists and rich peasants in Urianhai.\\n\\n\\\"What are you doing here?\\\" we asked with surprise.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, ho, you know nothing at all about what has been going on?\\\" replied a fairly old man who called himself Colonel Ostrovsky.  \\\"In Urianhai an order has been issued from the Military Commissioner to mobilize all men over twenty-eight years of age and everywhere toward the town of Belotzarsk are moving detachments of these Partisans.  They are robbing the colonists and peasants and killing everyone that falls into their hands.  We are hiding here from them.\\\"\\n\\nThe whole camp counted only sixteen rifles and three bombs, belonging to a Tartar who was traveling with his Kalmuck guide to his herds in Western Mongolia.  We explained the aim of our journey and our intention to pass through Mongolia to the nearest port on the Pacific.  The officers asked me to bring them out with us.  I agreed.  Our reconnaissance proved to us that there were no Partisans near the house of the peasant who was to ferry us over the Little Yenisei.  We moved off at once in order to pass as quickly as possible this dangerous zone of the Yenisei and to sink ourselves into the forest beyond.  It snowed but immediately thawed.  Before evening a cold north wind sprang up, bringing with it a small blizzard.  Late in the night our party reached the river.  Our colonist welcomed us and offered at once to ferry us over and swim the horses, although there was ice still floating which had come down from the head-waters of the stream.  During this conversation there was present one of the peasant's workmen, red-haired and squint-eyed.  He kept moving around all the time and suddenly disappeared.  Our host noticed it and, with fear in his voice, said:\\n\\n\\\"He has run to the village and will guide the Partisans here.  We must cross immediately.\\\"\\n\\nThen began the most terrible night of my whole journey.  We proposed to the colonist that he take only our food and ammunition in the boat, while we would swim our horses across, in order to save the time of the many trips.  The width of the Yenisei in this place is about three hundred metres.  The stream is very rapid and the shore breaks away abruptly to the full depth of the stream. The night was absolutely dark with not a star in the sky.  The wind in whistling swirls drove the snow and sleet sharply against our faces.  Before us flowed the stream of black, rapid water, carrying down thin, jagged blocks of ice, twisting and grinding in the whirls and eddies.  For a long time my horse refused to take the plunge down the steep bank, snorted and braced himself.  With all my strength I lashed him with my whip across his neck until, with a pitiful groan, he threw himself into the cold stream.  We both went all the way under and I hardly kept my seat in the saddle.  Soon I was some metres from the shore with my horse stretching his head and neck far forward in his efforts and snorting and blowing incessantly.  I felt the every motion of his feet churning the water and the quivering of his whole body under me in this trial. At last we reached the middle of the river, where the current became exceedingly rapid and began to carry us down with it.  Out of the ominous darkness I heard the shoutings of my companions and the dull cries of fear and suffering from the horses.  I was chest deep in the icy water.  Sometimes the floating blocks struck me; sometimes the waves broke up over my head and face.  I had no time to look about or to feel the cold.  The animal wish to live took possession of me; I became filled with the thought that, if my horse's strength failed in his struggle with the stream, I must perish.  All my attention was turned to his efforts and to his quivering fear.  Suddenly he groaned loudly and I noticed he was sinking.  The water evidently was over his nostrils, because the intervals of his frightened snorts through the nostrils became longer.  A big block of ice struck his head and turned him so that he was swimming right downstream.  With difficulty I reined him around toward the shore but felt now that his force was gone.  His head several times disappeared under the swirling surface.  I had no choice.  I slipped from the saddle and, holding this by my left hand, swam with my right beside my mount, encouraging him with my shouts.  For a time he floated with lips apart and his teeth set firm.  In his widely opened eyes was indescribable fear.  As soon as I was out of the saddle, he had at once risen in the water and swam more calmly and rapidly.  At last under the hoofs of my exhausted animal I heard the stones.  One after another my companions came up on the shore.  The well-trained horses had brought all their burdens over.  Much farther down our colonist landed with the supplies.  Without a moment's loss we packed our things on the horses and continued our journey.  The wind was growing stronger and colder.  At the dawn of day the cold was intense.  Our soaked clothes froze and became hard as leather; our teeth chattered; and in our eyes showed the red fires of fever: but we traveled on to put as much space as we could between ourselves and the Partisans.  Passing about fifteen kilometres through the forest we emerged into an open valley, from which we could see the opposite bank of the Yenisei.  It was about eight o'clock.  Along the road on the other shore wound the black serpent-like line of riders and wagons which we made out to be a column of Red soldiers with their transport.  We dismounted and hid in the bushes in order to avoid attracting their attention.\",\"timestamp\":1640140102,\"title\":\"\\nAt last the mountain of ice passed by, followed by the muddy freshets that carried down the trunks\"},\"digest\":\"cZ8uWANQ1UnWjBcM1IRJBHbVFSfbTZu0OCbeTRrV7GA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa216D8906Acd104a8EC6a31f93e945DFe15768c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jQeGtd8z7P5ulGBdZMQP5RUZ6pGMT7E4Hp27IwYKs0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eyW_fCHp7ufIKtYEwGSTndf9pwe0G6HcqK7CBKXDeuw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8pJBH6xZwerly9Bi7YScbLS5lIwQmjG41nJ9pf_R2a5G5iqAQ_zwOdlGqDG-62sUcYxgYo6FLhFtliSRaQu7Kw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x73ba59de6ec1caa3140e5862dd69fa8763cf37a25c8871b14846faf9a70c9e5151f36ece34c1e6f68fa37ac9d4ef92c8d5b7f99412873753c39c0e47a7afe0921c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jQeGtd8z7P5ulGBdZMQP5RUZ6pGMT7E4Hp27IwYKs0E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eyW_fCHp7ufIKtYEwGSTndf9pwe0G6HcqK7CBKXDeuw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cZ8uWANQ1UnWjBcM1IRJBHbVFSfbTZu0OCbeTRrV7GA\"}"
