"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"When I first discovered Mirror I thought it was a fascinating exploration of the web 3.0 design space. With crowdfunds, NFTs, and cool features built into the user experience thanks to Ethereum’s general purpose programmability, Mirror could be the end game in online publishing, replacing Medium and Substack with a superior product suite, owned by its community of writers and readers, allowing both to share in wealth creation in unprecedented ways. \\n\\nCrowdfunding is what enables change. We can’t rely on governments to. \\n\\nI ilterally can’t\\n\\nAnonymous crowdfunding. \\n\\nWriting competitions? \\n\\nAs founder Graeme says, “Social forums like Mirror can use ownership verification to legitimize an account's voice within these communities, producing social capital for a pseudonymous avatar - without revealing the identity of the owner. This allows anonymous individuals to reliably coordinate, transact, and advance group values - an innovation in global collective action. \\n\\nFrom the first article I read, I was itching to write on the platform and try out some of the new features. That’s already a good sign. But Mirror kept me waiting. They did something smart, they only allowed a small number of contributors to initially write for the platform - rewarding them with a token called $WRITE that could be cast as a vote for the next 10 members on the platform. This approach maintained quality and stoked demand for access. The uses of $WRITE token by its community will be governed by its culture and value system which is still taking shape. \\n\\nThis is why it's been so important for Mirror to go slow with onboarding, and to try its best to diversify its membership. We've received some criticism for this, but ultimately this will enable true decentralized ownership. If we can accelerate membership over time while maintaining integrity, then we can create universal ownership drips that enable hard-to-fake, true decentralization.\\n\\nThe plot twist is that this is already happening, but nobody has noticed it yet. So, stay tuned.\\n\\nAs the platform grew I tried to access it and was forced to authenticate by tweeting a prepared message created by the Mirror team. I did this several times and was unable to access the Mirror platform. To be able to just connect freely with your metamask and start writing. This is the key. \\n\\nFinal note: Financial contributors and developers should be rewarded, too. But the distribution algorithm needs to keep this in check so that it can't be gamed, and that it's set up to allow for long-term rewards, and doesn't just enrich the early contributors. We want to make a new and better world through decentralized ownership, and that means we have to steer clear of the old patterns where early contributors and adopters get too much.”\\n\\nMirror is open-source. Meaning that different communities can have different. \\n\\nHow do you really know that other platforms aren’t recording everything you write and a backdoor for government surveillance? People can really come together with this technology and share. It’s the most important platform ever created. A truly censorship resistant marketplace of ideas. The digital printing press of the 21st century. \\n\\nI think using crowdfunds and NFTs to promote certain behaviors within a publisher’s community will create some of the most productive redistributions of wealth in history. I don’t know what those applications / behaviors are yet but they are coming and they will be financially irresistible to Medium and Substack influencers.\\n\\nI’ve been studying tokenomics and it seems somewhat untenable. Due to US securities regulations, projects are being forced to withhold incredible wealth from their US users. You need to indemnify U.S. citizens from blocking access to the dy/dx airdrop. There’s a ton of people in the U.S. who missed out on the token. That’s how hard you have to bet on the market. \\n\\nYour most precious resource is time. That’s why I want to help you navigate the world of crypto opportunities. \\n\\n a freer market for ideas and crushed the church.\\n\\nMirror is the most free market for ideas and is censorship resistant.\\n\\nI would buy $Write Tokens. The demand for ownership in this asset class is based on VCs who are locking value in certain projects. It’s hard to really trust the valuations because rugs happen. Anything can be rugged. \\n\\nCore values - before you let companies sponsor you\\n\\nI like that\",\"timestamp\":1633558435,\"title\":\"Notes\"},\"digest\":\"CIpjhlcCOyW2tnzWQHIwFVaSxrItStxFpb-IQTGjDCg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7b769566882Df5c3B7f2c7985ff3B328c17418F4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0bbxYZmxA3Kgm5QmgjjWjZUyCmtnxvFUOh5WjzHwEsk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Zfout5S-imGQyd_iDJI73VUkPLwK3b1ReKPPs6KBQ7E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OMuopzkvA2_pREH2Mzx5eeVsSivJCBLnXKMM73OlEnj264j52sGT5Z_dZ_kul1cwoAhnbSmu6W6Bq7sVM33mRw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0a4b0cfc0b322694f18d59ca4ad1e5ab82725d5279dd3156a0ba63b0bd1324eb0769f7bffa78526af183675882cf59bb492908756ef3c00378a0db3ddcd831241b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0bbxYZmxA3Kgm5QmgjjWjZUyCmtnxvFUOh5WjzHwEsk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Zfout5S-imGQyd_iDJI73VUkPLwK3b1ReKPPs6KBQ7E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CIpjhlcCOyW2tnzWQHIwFVaSxrItStxFpb-IQTGjDCg\"}"
