I could only choose one that convinced me this is gonna be huge, the most important of all.\\n\\nThey have a great idea/project, involving a huge market (photography) and an emerging technology-based one (NFTs/blockchain). This is an intersection that provides benefits for both markets: a gateway to the audience for photographers and a source of unique, quality content for the NFT market. But this is not the most important reason why Quantum Art will be successful. \\n  \\n They bring in the best photographers in the world, with pieces that take your breath away and ideas that make your head spin. If you haven‚Äôt seen JoeyL‚Äôs Ethiopia photos, if you haven‚Äôt read the idea behind Amy Elkins‚Äô Anxious Pleasures, if you didn‚Äôt get to know New York from its inhabitant‚Äôs portraits made by Sally Davies‚Ä¶ I suggest you do that asap. Amazing stories behind each shot, shared by the artist in their discord channel - that‚Äôs just the layer that you want when collecting anything worth collecting. \\n Still, this is not the most important advantage of all (but a consequence).\\n\\nThe most attribute of all is‚Ä¶ ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å ü•Å ‚Ä¶ the team.\\n\\nIf you talked to Justin Aversano in their discord, you saw his confidence and drive that makes him who he is. You also see all the effort he‚Äôs putting in this whole project (and all the adjacent ones, that help form the backbone of the NFT photography market - more about this later). A man praised by most of his friends and acquaintances you meet online - in Twitter, Discord, news, everywhere. A man that always has time to chat with the people or answer their questions; that always has time to come with a new idea or bring up an idea launched by somebody in #quantum-suggestions. At times I even thought he gets no sleep, seeing him in all these places every day.\\n\\nAll the other team members share his passion and drive to make this the stepping stone of the new photography evolution process. Each of their strong points complements and enforces Justin‚Äôs passion. And you can see this clearly joining their Discord server and watching the people talking - no spam, no hate, no nonsense. Just people wanting to be part of the revolution/evolution.\\n\\nThe other infrastructure projects brought or endorsed by this team - RAW Dao, Obscura, Assembly, Fingerprints DAO - are all in the same ‚Äúindustry‚Äù of photo NFTs and they all help in building the first layer of many to come. \\n\\nLook at the project‚Äôs positioning, look at QA‚Äôs brand tone, look at their availability to talk and to receive feedback, look at their additional infrastructure projects and endorsed partnerships and you can imagine where this is going for the future.\\n\\nI am happy and grateful to be part of this project and to be able to interact with all these amazing people every single day.\",\"timestamp\":1637771887,\"title\":\"Why I think Quantum Art the next big thing in NFT and photo\"},\"digest\":\"QmdyEPV8YmWACT6Y_J7c-6KGA8EOuENNgbr-mDBrOHU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1caF1CB7Be89AdC0AFC8df5DACC1377AbC4B86e9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"isiodAvLsSKK4v7RdNrn-WrCM5mPULeAQdT9dM6sjWc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"W0FATuv_Zu46i0N7QdqgyI0kRplKGkGEeKBsGBcdfqE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iLv4y1qIeBpimG9Er1OWu2DTXm6PlPQN10_wH-OnKcjxD5BIR319x4HBIVa7x6DAVFeFAcvmCt4nIghHmnaVwA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf77cbd3d0d23a556be72ad3cecdc6e45b708b69bb8c544cf3869e87f3eaa76807a1ac6135a629373b940de01216b9f5d5bc88eb5112f7ac9481552df8521a5ab1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"isiodAvLsSKK4v7RdNrn-WrCM5mPULeAQdT9dM6sjWc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"W0FATuv_Zu46i0N7QdqgyI0kRplKGkGEeKBsGBcdfqE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QmdyEPV8YmWACT6Y_J7c-6KGA8EOuENNgbr-mDBrOHU\"}"
