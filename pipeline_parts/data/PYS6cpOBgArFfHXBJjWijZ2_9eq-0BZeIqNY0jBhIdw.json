"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Signorina remembered his feats in the water. All his self-confidence returned, all his former certainty that the Signorina was secretly devoted to him. His days of doubt and fury were forgotten. His jealousy of Emilio vanished in a cloud of happy contempt for the disabilities of age, and he began to talk to Vere with a vivacity that was truly Neapolitan. When the Marchesino was joyous he had charm, the charm that emanates from the bounding life that flows in the veins of youth. Even the Puritan feels, and fears, the grace that is Pagan. The Marchesino had a Pagan grace. And now it returned to him and fell about him like a garment, clothing body and soul. And Vere seemed to respond to it. She began to chatter, too. She talked lightly, flicking him with little whips of sarcasm that did not hurt, but only urged him on. The humor of a festa might begin to flow from these two.\\n\\nAnd again, instead of infecting Artois, it seemed to set him apart, to rebuke silently his gifts, his fame--to tell him that they were useless, that they could do nothing for him.\\n\\nThe Marchesino was not troubled with an intellect. Yet with what ease he found words to play with the words of Vere! His Latin vivacity seemed a perfect substitute for thought, for imagination, for every subtlety. He bubbled like champagne. And when champagne winks and foams at the edge of the shining glass, do the young think of, or care for, the sober gravity, the lingering bouquet of claret, even if it be Chateau Margaux?\\n\\nAs Artois half listened to the young people, while he talked quietly with Hermione, playing the host with discretion, he felt the peculiar cruelty which ordains that the weapons of youth, even if taken up and used by age with vigor and competence, shall be only reeds in those hands whose lines tell of the life behind.\\n\\nYet how Vere and he had laughed together on the day of his return from Paris! One gust of such mutual laughter is worth how many days of earnest talk!\\n\\nVere was gleaming with fun to-night.\\n\\nThe waiters, as they went softly about the table, looked at her with kind eyes. Secretly they were enjoying her gayety because it was so pretty. Her merriment was as airy as the flight of a bird.\\n\\nThe Marchesino was entranced. Did she care for that?\\n\\nArtois wondered secretly, and was not sure. He had a theory that all women like to feel their power over men. Few men have not this theory. But there was in Vere something immensely independent, that seemed without sex, and that hinted at a reserve not vestal, but very pure-- too pure, perhaps, to desire an empire which is founded certainly upon desire.\\n\\nAnd the Marchesino was essentially and completely the young animal; not the heavy, sleek, and self-contented young animal that the northern countries breed, but the frolicsome, playful, fiery young animal that has been many times warmed by the sun.\\n\\nHermione felt that Artois' mood to-night echoed his mood at Frisio's, and suddenly she thought once more of the visitors' book and of what he had written there, surely in a moment of almost heated impulse. And as she thought of it she was moved to speak of her thought. She had so many secret reserves from Emile now that this one she could dispense with.\\n\\n\\\"You remember that night when I met you on the sea?\\\" she said to him.\\n\\nHe looked away from Vere and answered:\\n\\n\\\"Yes. What about it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When I was at the Scoglio di Frisio I looked again over that wonderful visitors' book.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. And I saw what you had written.\\\"\\n\\nTheir eyes met. She wondered if by the expression in hers he divined why she had made that expedition, moved by what expectation, by what curiosity. She could tell nothing by his face, which was calm and inscrutable.\\n\\nAfter an instant's pause he said:\\n\\n\\\"Do you know from whom those words come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. Are they your own?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Victor Hugo's. Do you like them?\\\"\\n\\nBut her eyes were asking him a question, and he saw it.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Why did you write them?\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I had to write something. You made me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere suggested it first.\\\"\\n\\nHe looked again at Vere, but only for a moment. She was laughing at something the Marchesino was saying.\\n\\n\\\"Did she?--Oh! Take some of that salade a la Russe. I gave the chef the recipe for it.--Did she?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't you remember?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Those words were in my head. I put them down.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you fond of them?\\\"\\n\\nHer restless curiosity was still quite unsatisfied.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. But one has puzzled about conscience. Hasn't one?\\\"\\n\\nHe glanced at the Marchesino, who was bending forward to Vere, and illustrating something he was telling her by curious undulating gestures with both hands that suggested a flight.\\n\\n\\\"At least some of us have,\\\" he continued. \\\"And some never have, and never will.\\\"\\n\\nHermione understood the comment on their fellow-guest.\\n\\n\\\"Do you think that saying explains it satisfactorily?\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"I believe sometimes we know a great deal more than we know we know,\\\" he answered. \\\"That sounds like some nonsense game with words, but it's the best way to put it. Conscience seems to speak out of the silence. But there may be some one in the prompter's box--our secret knowledge.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But is it knowledge of ourselves, or of others?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Which do you think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of ourselves, I suppose. I think we generally know far less of others than we believe ourselves to know.\\\"\\n\\nShe expressed his thought of her earlier in the evening.\\n\\n\\\"Probably. And nevertheless we may know things of them that we are not aware we know--till after we have instinctively acted on our knowledge.\\\"\\n\\nTheir eyes met again. Hermione felt in that moment as if he knew why she had given Vere the permission to read his books.\\n\\nBut still she did not know whether he had written that sentence in the book at Frisio's carelessly, or prompted by some violent impulse to express a secret thought or feeling of the moment.\\n\\n\\\"Things good or evil?\\\" she said, slowly.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps both.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino burst into a laugh. He leaned back in his chair, shaking his head, and holding the table with his two hands. His white teeth gleamed.\\n\\n\\\"What is the joke?\\\" asked Artois.\\n\\nVere turned her head.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, nothing. It's too silly. I can't imagine why the Marchesino is so much amused by it.\\\"\\n\\nArtois felt shut out. But when Vere and he had laughed over the tea- table in a blessed community of happy foolishness, who could have understood their mirth? He remembered how he had pitied the imagined outsider.\\n\\nHe turned again to Hermione, but such conversation as theirs, and indeed all serious conversation, now seemed to him heavy, portentous, almost ludicrous. The young alone knew how to deal with life, chasing it as a child chases a colored air-ball, and when it would sink, and fall and be inert, sending it with a gay blow soaring once more towards the blue.\\n\\nPerhaps Hermione had a similar thought, or perhaps she knew of it in him. At any rate, for a moment she had nothing to say. Nor had he. And so, tacitly excluded, as it seemed, from the merriment of the young ones, the two elders remained looking towards each other in silence, sunk in a joint exile.\\n\\nPresently Artois began to fidget with his bread. He pulled out some of the crumb from his roll, and pressed it softly between his large fingers, and scattered the tiny fragments mechanically over the table- cloth near his plate. Hermione watched his moving hand. The Marchesino was talking now. He was telling Vere about a paper-chase at Capodimonte, which had started from the Royal Palace. His vivacity, his excitement made a paper-chase seem one of the most brilliant and remarkable events in a brilliant and remarkable world. He had been the hare. And such a hare! Since hares were first created and placed in the Garden of Eden there had been none like unto him. He told of his cunning exploits.\\n\\nThe fingers of Artois moved faster. Hermione glanced at his face. Its massiveness looked heavy. The large eyes were fixed upon the table- cloth. His hand just then was more expressive. And as she glanced at it again something very pitiful awoke in her, something pitiful for him and for herself. She felt that very often lately she had misunderstood him--she had been confused about him. But now, in this moment, she understood him perfectly.\\n\\nHe pulled some more crumb out of his roll.\\n\\nShe was fascinated by his hand. Much as it had written, it had never written more clearly on paper than it was writing now.\\n\\nBut suddenly she felt as if she could not look at it any more, as if it was intolerable to look at it. And she turned towards the open window.\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\" Artois asked her. \\\"Is there too much air for you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh no. It isn't that. I was only thinking what a quantity of people pass by, and wondering where they were all going, and what they were all thinking and hoping. I don't know why they should have come into my head just then. I suppose it will soon be time for us to start for the festa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. We'll have coffee in my sitting-room--when they are ready.\\\" He looked again at Vere and the Marchesino.\\n\\n\\\"Have we all finished? I thought we would go and have coffee up- stairs. What do you say, Vere?\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke cheerfully.\\n\\n\\\"Yes; do let us.\\\"\\n\\nThey all got up. As Hermione and Vere moved towards the door Artois leaned out of the window for a moment.\\n\\n\\\"You needn't be afraid. There will be no storm to-night, Emilio!\\\" said the Marchesino, gayly--almost satirically.\\n\\n\\\"No--it's quite fine.\\\"\\n\\nArtois drew in. \\\"We ought to have a perfect evening,\\\" he added, quietly.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIX\\n\\n\\\"How are we going to drive to the Carmine?\\\" said Artois to Hermione, when she had taken her cloak and was ready to go down.\\n\\n\\\"We must have two carriages.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere and I will go in one, with Gaspare on the box, and you and the Marchese can follow in the other.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora,\\\" said the Marchesino, drawing on his white gloves, \\\"you still do not trust us? You are still determined to take the watch-dog? It is cruel of you. It shows a great want of faith in Emilio and in me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare must come.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino said no more, only shrugged his shoulders with an air of humorous resignation which hid a real chagrin. He knew how watchful a Sicilian can be, how unyielding in attention to his mistresses, if he thinks they need protection.\\n\\nBut perhaps this Gaspare was to be bribed.\\n\\nInstinctively the Marchesino put his hand into his waistcoat pocket, and began to feel the money there.\\n\\nYes, there was a gold piece.\\n\\n\\\"Come, Panacci!\\\"\\n\\nEmilio's hand touched his shoulder, and he followed the ladies out of the room.\\n\\nEmilio had called him \\\"Panacci.\\\" That sounded almost like a declaration of war. Well, he was ready. At dinner his had been the triumph, and Emilio knew it. He meant his triumph to be a greater one before the evening was over. The reappearance of the gay child in Vere, grafted upon the comprehending woman whom he had seen looking out of her eyes on the day of his last visit to the island, had put the finishing touch to the amorous madness of the Marchesino. He dreamed Vere an accomplished coquette. He believed that her cruelty on the night of his serenade, that her coldness and avoidance of him on the day of the lunch, were means devised to increase his ardor. She had been using Emilio merely as an instrument. He had been a weapon in her girlish hands. That was the suitable fate of the old--usefulness.\\n\\nThe Marchesino was in a fever of anticipation. Possibly Vere would play into his hands when they got to the festa. If not, he must manage things for himself. The Signora, of course, would make Emilio her escort. Vere would naturally fall to him, the Marchesino.\\n\\nBut there was the fifth--this Gaspare.\\n\\nWhen they came out to the pavement the Marchesino cast a searching glance at the Sicilian, who was taking the cloaks, while the two carriages which had been summoned by the hotel porter were rattling up from the opposite side of the way. Gaspare had saluted him, but did not look at him again. When Hermione and Vere were in the first carriage, Gaspare sprang on to the box as a matter of course. The Marchesino went to tell the coachman which way to drive to the Carmine. When he had finished he looked at Gaspare and said:\\n\\n\\\"There will be a big crowd. Take care the Signora does not get hurt in it.\\\"\\n\\nHe laid a slight emphasis on the word \\\"Signora,\\\" and put his hand significantly into his waistcoat-pocket.\\n\\nGaspare regarded him calmly.\\n\\n\\\"Va bene, Signor Marchese,\\\" he replied. \\\"I will take care of the Signora and the Signorina.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino turned away and jumped into the second carriage with Emilio, realizing angrily that his gold piece would avail him nothing.\\n\\nAs they drove off Artois drew out some small square bits of paper.\\n\\n\\\"Here's your ticket for the enclosure,\\\" he said, giving one to the Marchesino.\\n\\n\\\"Grazie. But we must walk about. We must show the ladies the fun in the Mercato. It is very dull to stay all the evening in the enclosure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We will do whatever they like, of course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Keep close to the other carriage! Do you hear?\\\" roared the Marchesino to the coachman.\\n\\nThe man jerked his head, cracked his whip, pulled at his horse's mouth. They shot forward at a tremendous pace, keeping close by the sea at first, then turning to the left up the hill towards the Piazza del Plebiscito. The Marchesino crossed his legs, folded his arms, and instinctively assumed the devil-may-care look characteristic of the young Neapolitan when driving through his city.\\n\\n\\\"Emilio,\\\" he said, after a moment, looking at Artois out of the corners of his eyes without moving his head, \\\"when I was at the island the other day, do you know whom I saw in the house?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A girl of the town. A bad girl. You understand?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you mean a girl with a wounded cheek?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. How can the Signora have her there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Signora knows all about her,\\\" said Artois, dryly.\\n\\n\\\"She thinks so!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you mean?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If the Signora really knew, could she take such a girl to live with the Signorina?\\\"\\n\\nThe conversation was rapidly becoming insupportable to Artois.\\n\\n\\\"This is not our affair,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"I do not say it is. But still, as I am a Neapolitan, I think it a pity that some one does not explain to the Signora how impossible--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Caro mio!\\\" Artois exclaimed, unable to endure his companion's obvious inclination to pose as a protector of Vere's innocence. \\\"English ladies do not care to be governed. They are not like your charming women. They are independent and do as they choose. You had much better not bother your head about what happens on the island. Very soon the Signora may be leaving it and going away from Naples.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Davvero?\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino turned right round in the little carriage, forgetting his pose.\\n\\n\\\"Davvero? No. I don't believe it. You play with me. You wish to frighten me.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637315354,\"title\":\"\\nThe young man was immediately in the seventh Heaven.\"},\"digest\":\"8HvsfJQS3v1T9Cu2LFuR_UVWJV-L3rgDNZSMHgnuyiE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b55Ba15E3e103d91f6dec37dd48B84ddF5B245C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8esa5ytNsy4T6TM5LiE0EJ9upE42_xq4tFX6ef0qMQ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dLyV18cnIITah9phcB9S_Vqyb3B9btUfO7Y_9fk0XAQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FE8icozagsCkbUW89Uvbuz5VFoplb-p0yntQ68rsSfj09YqgVSRTHID8M234uU0-y9oJpDZirOx8pADU_sEzLg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x256ab4ea436b917565a5dcf793e643a1240ee6e87e7d3a46acc3bff4c7981f761c3079da4ef820bd45f8c6c3f8a7de94952d45a534cd0f57d46b72ede001173e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8esa5ytNsy4T6TM5LiE0EJ9upE42_xq4tFX6ef0qMQ0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dLyV18cnIITah9phcB9S_Vqyb3B9btUfO7Y_9fk0XAQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8HvsfJQS3v1T9Cu2LFuR_UVWJV-L3rgDNZSMHgnuyiE\"}"
