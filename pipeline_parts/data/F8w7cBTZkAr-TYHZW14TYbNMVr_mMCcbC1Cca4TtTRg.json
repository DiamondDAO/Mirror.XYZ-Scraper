"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My core position in October will be LUNA, because its Columbus-5 network upgrade will become a catalyst for its currency price to take off, and I will also bet on Axie, the leader in the meta-universe/game field. L1 has performed well and NFT is this year\\nTwo main trends, so the funds allocated in them are higher than in other areas.\\n\\nOther funds are mainly invested in LP income farming and some specific market sectors. BTC and ETH will move slowly, so it is mainly a scalping strategy rather than holding long-term volatility, until I think there is no higher beta return elsewhere. Once ETH regains its position at about $3,600, I think it will quickly hit a record high. BTC still faces a lot of resistance in the USD 55,000-58,000 cabinet that it needs to break through, so I will look for opportunities to rewrite the high point of the cabinet in this range. Once it breaks through the 58,000 U.S. dollar level,\\nI am worried that ALT/BTC will perform poorly and start to drive price discovery.\\nFrom a technical analysis point of view, LUNA has consolidated above its historical high since March for about 40 days and has risen by about 6 times from the bottom of the summer low. Once Columbus-5 goes live and all other projects in the ecosystem\\nStart, I expect it to break upward\\n\\nAxie is in a similar situation and has been consolidating for two months after the initial effort. Callback line about a week ago\\nIn love, it retested its high since July and rebounded strongly.\\nMy LP income farming / unilateral bets are distributed in multiple chains. Maintaining liquidity is one of the important reasons. Funds can be quickly transferred when the best opportunities arise. The two main recent examples are $TEDDY and\\n$JEWEL on Harmony, if you already follow these ecosystems, it is easier to find such opportunities.\\nFor BTC and ETH, the stronger confirmation at the bottom will bring a breakthrough above 45,000 USD / 3100 USD.\\nOverall view of the market: It is expected that benchmark currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum will have a slow upward trend, and altcoins with strong fundamental catalysts will outperform other altcoins, while dinosaur-grade altcoins and other altcoins that fail to deliver value\\nThe currency continued to underperform. The ideal rotation is to invest LUNA/Axie in price discovery in October, and then switch to\\nBenchmark currency, and then re-create the Solana position before the first quarter of next year as the main holding asset.\",\"timestamp\":1636195545,\"title\":\"Investment portfolio allocation in the fourth quarter worthy of attention\"},\"digest\":\"gOoOSAA98Qh2vu_rb0PUh5d2ihc8Ob9pH2ltx7MwYsk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0960374B9076DfB38dE2E89A8094392C774075EE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-cIHSSc2uI5KbIy3lFsLd4F2skPQdt4O-3UBZpcZ09E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"exzSQ2cLoHXnJ18hbMtgFA3WGotWqUbZ7NSM6gYIJGM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UqA8LKS66sGGG58P_YngPLjlwtpQYoCKbQG_D9rk9PRWKRzJi15j8F-hKMmK_TgoHwKEO8lzFigRIpg7FCb2cg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4d383ae15e13b068ea4c105f697d8ff50ab5d4fbf757f87d6b17b1bc8d1f175e251777be7a2aced5857069e5ab2a1fc713e2511c9a7eaf337198e4aa3536faa01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-cIHSSc2uI5KbIy3lFsLd4F2skPQdt4O-3UBZpcZ09E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"exzSQ2cLoHXnJ18hbMtgFA3WGotWqUbZ7NSM6gYIJGM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gOoOSAA98Qh2vu_rb0PUh5d2ihc8Ob9pH2ltx7MwYsk\"}"
