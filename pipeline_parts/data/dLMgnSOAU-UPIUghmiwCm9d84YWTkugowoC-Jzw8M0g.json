"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"So my goal with this blog is to start writing, one hour a day. Bear with me as the beginning might be bad and or not good to read. \\n\\nThe aim of this is to put my psychological observations to paper and create a kind of guide towards happiness from a scientific perspective. I will try to address and hopefully find cures for the “human condition”. Along the way it will contain observations made in an unscientific manner linked to my own interpretations of current psychological research. \\n\\nSo firstly I would like to define the “human condition”. It stems from being a functional human being in a society which nearly all of us are, some more than others. We need to see each other from the outside and see us as a social unit. This is similar to what Douglas Hofstadter says in [I Am a Strange Loop](https://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAm-Strange-Loop-Douglas-Hofstadter%2Fdp%2F0465030793&t=Mzk1YzAwOTNiNTYwNmI3MzUxZmZhMDQ1MzQzZDU1ODAwNjkyY2IyMSxkYzA4YjY0MGZmZWZkMWM4ZjhhZWZhMDIwMjUxNzQyNTBkYTU0ODYw&ts=1639476959). We see and compare ourselves to others often causing us to be unsatisfied with what we see. Yet this is key as there is no other way to improve without comparison. Conversely it can cause great misery. \\n\\nBut we do not only compare to others we compare to previous selves or future selves or different states of self. (These could or even should, to be fair, be classified as other people more on that later). As this blog is meant to be action-based the first lesson here is to see others as a necessary evil (”L'enfer, c'est les autres”; “Hell is other people” - Sartre). Without other people one could not exist. At the same time other people can define and limit the self. \\n\\nTL;DR: The reason “you” exist is other people and the fact you see yourself in relationship to others (or different versions of yourself).\",\"timestamp\":1639476987,\"title\":\"Unresearch - goals\"},\"digest\":\"MGG7NArT8maecI2OfpG6o456cWSdwUMnI2tJevC92J8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcC1Fa03e8172B22B90a68615872F47D3B703A610\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"APK_705KGmNfsRBruOrs9UKe1eeYEXHbzfJmr4V50nMoyZZfWntw21xKbQl6bF0sabCQn0_PfretQZv3n-PwuA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x604ab1fb886724196c480c557c059bad0a71cc5d1af0bd5421202517fc744bd96d893a7212cc12082dbde2685be15114ba162a8c9742cf9a71a0be9568d930751b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FfDlpZddWtaluNWXD7W6dN8mFghe_YfwmYHI0PlFQ5k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_S1OW_CAbpMjvy21mU1kFNuJgFXBn-KtdbhSBPu93C8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MGG7NArT8maecI2OfpG6o456cWSdwUMnI2tJevC92J8\"}"
