"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’m thinking I’d like to write more. Writing is a way for me to process information and solidify my own perspectives. Not doing it feels like a disservice to myself, and hopefully a few other people may connect to my words. My first impression on going through getting started with this web3 was an instinct to copy the personalities I see on my Twitter homefeed. They all have a mirror.xyz site, a blah.eth, and a cool avatar. How do I do that? Will I know what to do after?\\n\\nThe first thing I’ll write is a quote that captures the essence of a recent thought I’ve had in a few areas:\\n\\n## “Narratives = Colors”\\n\\n* We see the world with them\\n* We have favorite ones\\n* You can mix and match them to make new ones\\n* Infinite amounts all made from a few primaries\\n\\n**What’re my narratives then?**\\n\\nExponentially increasing inequality is bad. Raising the floor is good.\\n\\nBeing your authentic self. Undergoing Mimesis.\\n\\nListening to everyones feelings. Deciding based on Fact / Policy.\\n\\nThe Value of Feelings vs Rationality.\\n\\nFreedom and Creativity vs Regulation and Oversight.\\n\\nSocial Media is a telescope, magnifying human race’s thoughts, expressions, and desires, being chaotically and rapidly swung around by a 3 year old child that we can’t understand.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI’m hoping to write more about some of these ideas in areas I’ve worked in (tech, mental health, finance) and areas I enjoy reading and talking about (economy, politics, culture). Doing it on web3 makes sense if we can have a conversation more easily here.\",\"timestamp\":1640318134,\"title\":\"Giving this an web3 thing the ol' go\"},\"digest\":\"amWxFXVLOYbvMhNokx4sctpsAU5gAfEKnmmEIT3imWA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD126841953bEb5BBD5759ef2150F3D612516ACBD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cN1r4Lo46FT9yraQJYb6h8ExL-SsxokEGGyBFSSmbW0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cbtUpLoQE2IID9Itu8o0i76uak1NBst-l1HmM2ApudE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IXTkYKYblelYNaYw5JFUopQV6yKFydsSf8wViWqfgCP8Bj3dhGWSo22OXq0FSyEORnpbWgthgSBnE4mpaVUJ1Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xffdeccf851c860854fcf8461796050ec5cd1c0275cdd55bd78b569716918154e134fdd446b5495763b253f5b5ffb5f5ed6b5f7641abf10e75bd9d332fc99106b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cN1r4Lo46FT9yraQJYb6h8ExL-SsxokEGGyBFSSmbW0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cbtUpLoQE2IID9Itu8o0i76uak1NBst-l1HmM2ApudE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YCdfh6DH-3SZwfBgfNR9fUY6qogpxEGpnJKg4C1vGw8\"}"
