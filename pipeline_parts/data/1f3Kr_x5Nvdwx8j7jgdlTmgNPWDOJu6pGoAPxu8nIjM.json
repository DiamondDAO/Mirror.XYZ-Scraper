"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The play-and-earn game model embraces the concept of an open economy and financially rewards users who increase value by playing games and investing time in the game ecosystem. In the past, people thought that games were just a form of entertainment. With the emergence of new game types, this view is now changing. These games are not only fun, but also attractive investment opportunities. Speaking of investment, recently, large venture capital companies have invested a lot of money in this industry. In the 18 months ending in 2019, investment in the global game industry reached 9.6 billion U.S. dollars. In the first half of 2021 alone, 24 blockchain-based game companies received a total of 476 million U.S. dollars in investment.\\n\\nRecently, games like Axie Infinity and The Sandbox have become popular, and one thing they have in common is their economic system. Taking the traditional game \\\"The Sims\\\" as an example, players can use in-game currency to purchase in-game assets, but these currencies and assets have no real-world value. This is because there is no liquidity infrastructure in the game. Another traditional game World of Warcraft \\\"World of Warcraft\\\" also has a market where players can buy in-game assets and exchange characters, but this market is very loose. Blockchain technology combined with the play and earn model solves all these problems.\",\"timestamp\":1634222317,\"title\":\"What is a game of earning while playing?\"},\"digest\":\"gvz0eMYhEtwB3TgGU_h97DSFuZYfXb2ztCeqiOVRHRw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4bb7f64c14E8Fdc02AA7c53153F7eD4Bb8d1744\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uEeL6ZKzxg_OkDpBHgm0EB-03WakNrVI3bEamRHmm84\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_pvoK_mHUhokDBUxk_MTFBbNzGJlKFMT7ia4judpp6Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IbttxAfLQQRDHIYRjIy17TEE0a0C9w04bj7d5XPJkU2X86aP3s4cAKiCscvojfjbLevSH7yfwOmfe5AxXvqKrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7bb35a434740018fa3f66fc31097b500415b2942aa05f183428976d5ade4e8cb5e76a76c03139ba184a117204ee8f3d14c60a569dbc7260f517c3c47793b8f4f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uEeL6ZKzxg_OkDpBHgm0EB-03WakNrVI3bEamRHmm84\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_pvoK_mHUhokDBUxk_MTFBbNzGJlKFMT7ia4judpp6Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gvz0eMYhEtwB3TgGU_h97DSFuZYfXb2ztCeqiOVRHRw\"}"
