"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As I was finishing up a workout at my local box, I saw an old ad for the gym taped to the white board.\\n\\n“CrossFit is more than fitness. It’s a community.”\\n\\nNo arguments here. I firmly believe one of the reasons CrossFit thrives today is its community. The reason people pay a lot of money for CrossFit is community. The reason most people stay active members at their gyms is community.\\n\\nPeople want to feel a part of something.\\n\\nBut something very interesting happened during the pandemic. CrossFit’s founder, Greg Glassman, was ousted for making insensitive tweets about the George Floyd situation, and further allegations of sexism, racism and homophobia were disclosed.\\n\\nIn the various articles that reported this, Glassman was described as a co-founder and then sole owner of CrossFit. All major organizational decisions were ultimately signed off by one person. The CEO. Glassman.\\n\\nMany affiliates (gyms officially associated with CrossFit HQ) distanced themselves from the organization, removed the term “CrossFit” from their names, and began saying that their methodology was functional fitness. The underlying sentiment was that CrossFit the community was separate from HQ.\\n\\nThis change, which many reverted when Glassman stepped down, showed the ability for CrossFit to decentralize. The pandemic showed that affiliates have the ability to manage their communities online. The various programs offered by professional CrossFit athletes proved that you don’t even need to join an affiliate. These programs’ workouts are organized similarly to local gyms, and the online community can provide the same sense of belonging.\\n\\nThis is all amazing. Despite losing one of its strongest attributes with in-person community and relationships, most affiliates managed to stay afloat. Members didn’t cancel their memberships, they rented equipment to take home, and everyone rode out the Covid wave while it lasted.\\n\\nThe biggest issue with all of this? Ownership.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe hardest thing when managing an online community is incentivizing its members to remain active. Many try do this through various channels. Zoom classes, swag drops, the occasional (but painfully awkward) meet and greets… They all get some initial participation going, but for most, the activity wains as new members’ initial enthusiasm drops.\\n\\nAlso, the lack of coordination from gyms at the top level was a concern. Many gyms remain (officially or unofficially) disaffiliated with CrossFit HQ and have decided to go in their own direction. This lack of coordination can lead to a poor end product, which ends up with people getting physically hurt. Five times CrossFit Games champion Mat Fraser brought this up on Joe Rogan’s podcast.\\n\\nI’ll spare you all from the crypto promo, but something made possible by crypto is a truly decentralized organizational structure. One that gives everyone the opportunity to own a stake, and participate within the organization at the speed they’d like to.\\n\\nThis structure could create CrossFit’s 3.0 dream or nightmare. 1.0 was inception. 2.0 was the use of technology to track and scale the progress of CrossFit communities and its members.\\n\\n3\\\\.0 is something much more powerful.\\n\\n3\\\\.0 will be inspired by the Web3 revolution. It will incentivize community members through financial capital, and will build upon the social capital that CrossFit has already generated.\\n\\nI wrote above that online CrossFit at times was painful, but it doesn’t have to be. With more coordination, standardization of communication channels, and a hierarchy based on CrossFit-related competence, combined with participation and ownership, there could be a real engine that redefines what it means to be a part of a fitness community.\\n\\nLet’s break down the four things (in my opinion) that are most pressing to build this type of engine.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n**1. Ownership**\\n\\nIn order for someone to be an owner, they need to provide value to the organization. In order to receive ownership for providing value, there needs to be a treasury (sum of money) where collateral can be added and capital can be distributed from.\\n\\nThe best way to organize this is through digital tokens. A group of early founders create a token pool and put up their own individual capital to receive portions of the pool. They then allocate certain percentages of the pool for future members to invest, earn through participation and they can also allocate tokens for other initiatives they find important. For example, scholarship funds or community programs.\\n\\nThis form of incentivisation creates financial reward and gain for members of the community as it grows, scales and increases in relevancy and mind share in the world.\\n\\nPeople like making money.\\n\\n**2. Social Capital**\\n\\nAs mentioned, one of CrossFit’s best attributes is its community. If the community structure and organization were to move online, there is still a real human element that can be leveraged.\\n\\nSay that members of this online community have engaged with each other for certain periods of time, and one travels to a part of the world where the other lives. They can meet up at the gym for a workout, have a coffee or a beer, anything. The physical locations are already in place for this; there just needs to be better coordination and incentives to go out and interact within said locations.\\n\\nPeople already drop in to CrossFit gyms when they’re on the road (for outrageous fees may I add). This experience provides most a great workout, a greeting or two, but that’s really it.\\n\\nDoing this, however, through a format that is powered by an online community which you own a stake in will make the human experience more meaningful, memorable and worthwhile.\\n\\nI love dropping in to gyms, but imagine a world where your drop-in is actually a long awaited meet up? This is a better form of community.\\n\\n**3. Hierarchy & Governance**\\n\\nFounding members would need to have some form of credibility within CrossFit, or functional fitness in general. While wild west scenarios are fun, poor competence structures in this scenario would result in people getting physically hurt.\\n\\nTherefore, the founding team would need to create an onboarding process that determines a person’s competence level related to CrossFit. They would also need to create an onboarding process that enables aspiring contributors to work on the projects they want to.\\n\\n**Hierarchy**\\n\\nFor example, let’s say someone enters the community. They’ve purchased tokens and are now a member of the organization. Where do they stand in the hierarchy?\\n\\nThe organization creates an exam that members take to show their knowledge of CrossFit and/or functional fitness. Their score then determines where they stand in the competence hierarchy. Let’s say there are three levels to this. 3) Member 2) Athlete 1) Coach.\\n\\nPeople who join the community are explicitly told that coaches are those who provide fitness guidance, athletes can help with less pressing questions, and members are good to chat with. This hierarchy doesn’t exclude people from participation in various projects, it rather establishes a group of people where community members can route their fitness specific questions.\\n\\n**Contributing**\\n\\nThe other side of this is the onboarding of members who want to contribute. This can be done fairly easily at the beginning. Community members are asked where they want to participate, they are encouraged to engage in that area’s communication channels and are awarded with tokens as they complete projects.\\n\\nIf they were not previously token holders, they then become members of the organization and are assigned to the third level of the fitness competence hierarchy until passing the “exam” to move up.\\n\\n**Governance**\\n\\nThe two subjects discussed previously do not affect governance. Governance determines the direction of the organization, and there are many models that can be followed. To not dive down a technical rabbit hole, we’ll keep this explanation shorter.\\n\\nAny decision that affects the organization should be voted on by its members. Anyone who has ownership (owns tokens) in the organization can vote on proposals that would affect the future state of the organization. This furthers the financial incentivisation that members have, and will likely keep them more active and invested in the organization’s future.\\n\\nIt changes the game completely. HQ doesn’t tell you what to do. People submit proposals and members vote yes or no. If there are more yes votes than no, the proposal passes.\\n\\nA democratic fitness organization. Who would’ve thought?\\n\\nPS. There are many ways to determine the weight and value of someone’s vote. I would recommend googling *coin voting blockchain* and *quadratic voting blockchain* to understand this better.\\n\\n**4. Coordination**\\n\\nThe biggest hurdle that a prospective organization like this faces is coordination. Founding members will need to quickly establish the communication channels, member onboarding, the organization’s economics (tokenomics), and the governance structure.\\n\\nBy doing this, the organization will have a clear strategic narrative, new members won’t feel lost in a likely new world, and the community will be able to operate autonomously while maintaining its vision.\\n\\nIf these processes are quickly established, prior to scale, the end product of a CrossFit 3.0 will be far superior than its current state.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nCrossFit has changed my life for the better, and I couldn’t agree more with its philosophy and approach to sport, health and wellness. However, with another economic revolution on the horizon, it’s important that organizations that heavily rely on community understand the power of Web3 and DAO organizational structures.\\n\\nReason being, the decentralization experiment for CrossFit has produced a lot of economic upside for HQ and the influential persons associated with it and the CrossFit Games. Again this wasn’t and isn’t a bad thing, but it’s important to understand as generational and economic circumstances transform, organizations must transform with them. Otherwise, they will become increasingly irrelevant and possibly fail.\\n\\nA truly decentralized CrossFit that gives community ownership and a voice is an interesting proposition. One I believe would succeed. The economic distribution will change from few to all, and the social community will change from local to global.\",\"timestamp\":1635972878,\"title\":\"CrossFit & Web3\"},\"digest\":\"2UcSn1v1aE-W4W89Ci7YprDL-8E721b4NAu5YNzBFgw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa32D089F144e613106072fE2Ec4FF2ff95b7606D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mJ6WAmpHhswWTRw-jx4FGpR5iNQg3pCF7QW98mglIyQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RG3opD9byHHY2RPh8O3kEpr4bLvAXavLUTQzMWuUPJ8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"JOME9rUlkxWa4XQUtto9WRHS0li535kCQCwskJIQ7CE7z1F1FK2rhqOKQuoExo7nmX3dsiHcUYH8yeb3zvd7OQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x58f5942dfb60f801f5fa49d8151a962b1632f57fdbae0d589e6abfaeef0a4d783d772399028669d11a98162f9bff47ab2adc13c78684a68cf79db1c7c072fb021c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mJ6WAmpHhswWTRw-jx4FGpR5iNQg3pCF7QW98mglIyQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"RG3opD9byHHY2RPh8O3kEpr4bLvAXavLUTQzMWuUPJ8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"v2ZEBQAQTPYdLPtnxx2g7r4kYW8BRfrfCn_DsElRcbY\"}"
