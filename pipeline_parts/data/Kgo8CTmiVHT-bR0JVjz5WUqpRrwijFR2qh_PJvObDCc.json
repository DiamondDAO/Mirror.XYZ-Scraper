"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Should Students Be Separated By Age?\\n\\nWritten by Demetria R. Giles\\n\\n**Original Publication Date: Aug 8, 2021**\\n\\nRepublished on Dec. 21, 2021\\n\\n**Enter into a future Numinous Park and you will notice that there are several aspects of the physical design, learning model, and student makeup, that are outside of the norm, for most educational settings.**\\n\\n**The Park aesthetics. The student autonomy. [The fun criterion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=idvGlr0aT3c).**\\n\\n**These are just a few of the offerings that set us apart. Yet, one of the most pronounced characteristics of our learning academy is our approach to grade levels, or age-specific classes.**\\n\\n**5, 18, 11, 7, 14.**\\n\\n**These numbers are not the sequence for a winning lottery ticket.**\\n\\n**They represent the composition of ages you might find on any given playground, at any given time, at a future Numinous Park. We encourage students from birth to 18 years-old to apply, enroll, and eventually become mentors.**\\n\\n**While this age range represents the scope of grades in the traditional K-12 American school system, we have taken K-12 and actually allowed it to be a *real* continuum.**\\n\\n**At Numinous Park, our approach to grade levels is *no* approach. We intentionally do not age segregate students into grade levels because (1) it’s totally bizarre if you truly think about it, and (2) we know that age diversity is a strength.**\\n\\n**Think about the people you spend the most time with on a daily basis. Reflect on your friends, mentors, colleagues, neighbors, spiritual guides. How old are they?**\\n\\n**Chances are that many of the people you conjured up are not your exact same age.**\\n\\n**Maybe you have an older colleague that is able to mentor you when you have a work-related dilemma. Maybe you have a younger friend with whom you are able to share lessons learned about relationships, family, and life.**\\n\\n**In a given relational context, you are either on the mature or inexperienced end of the age continuum, and it’s these age mixed environments that provide us with peers who become conduits of our own learning through proximity and observation.**\\n\\n**Imagine for a moment only being able to befriend or work with other people who were your *exact* age with no more than a few months variance. That would seem ridiculous, weird, and incredibly difficult.**\\n\\n**Not to mention it could potentially leave many of us lonely.**\\n\\n**So why do we impose age segregation onto students as though it were a fundamental tenet of learning? And what exactly is age diversity, and why is it ideal?**\\n\\n**Age-diverse ([aged-mixed, multi-aged](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ985544.pdf)) environments are spaces that allow children of varying ages to interact, learn and grow from one another. There is usually at least a 2-year difference in age for true age-mixed classrooms, which allows for the activation of Lev Vygotsky’s [zone of proximal development](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/zone-of-proximal-development).**\\n\\n**In an environment where there are is a natural range of ability due to age diversity, we are able to create by design a learning space that is in itself a [problem space](https://www.numinouspark.com/).**\\n\\n**Older students have to refine their own understanding of concepts in order to assist younger students, and in return younger students are introduced to concepts and skills that otherwise would be beyond their ability to understand.**\\n\\n**This is the sweet spot where we are able to encourage students to go beyond actual development to potential development.**\\n\\n**When leveraged properly, the variety of perspective, thought, development, and experience that comes from age-diverse learning, will drastically improve, and even accelerate, the learning experience for all.**\\n\\n**The future of human progress is dependent on this.**\\n\\n**Picture this — a five-year-old observing a seventeen-year-old tinkering on a robot in the middle of a playground; a twelve-year-old giving conflict resolution advice to a small group of 6 and 7-year-old students who are having trouble working together; an eighteen-year-old coaching an 8-year-old on public speaking, so that they are prepared for their first project showing at an upcoming expo.**\\n\\n**This is the power of age diversity. It is the secret sauce or hidden superpower of large families, multigenerational households, fraternal orders, as well as *thriving* ecosystems and economies.**\\n\\n**On the flip side, when students are in classes or grade levels with same-aged peers, there is often more of a tendency on the part of adults, and children themselves, to play the comparison game, which can lead to unnecessary competition among students.**\\n\\n**As fun as games can be, competition is not always healthy with regards to establishing space to think like an optimist, engage in infinite play, and take bold risks with one’s learning. However, in age-diverse environments like Numinous Park, when children already know that another student is years ahead of them age-wise, they are more likely to take them on as a mentor from whom they can learn instead of a competitor they have to beat.**\\n\\n**When students collide in this way for the purpose of shared learning and support, as opposed to the latter example, we make space for all of the possibilities for human progress to exist. We make space for minds to combine and produce new knowledge for building the future.**\\n\\n**Age is more than a number, it is a continuum. Mainstream education wants so badly for us to treat age as a fixed state of being. If you are X-years old, then you should be presented with a predetermined Y-curriculum that was designed for your specific age.**\\n\\n**If this sounds stifling, that's because it is.**\\n\\n**This design method, although efficient for educational systems, schools, and even teachers, does not take into account that a child may be years ahead in literacy, years behind in social-emotional intelligence, and on-age with regards to mathematics abilities.**\\n\\n**Same-aged pairings do not take seriously the individual and the diversity within an individual. Grade levels are oppressive. They limit access to resources and skills to which students should otherwise have unlimited access.**\\n\\n**Our multi-aged learning approach honors what we know to be true about children’s innate ability to explore, question, and solve problems, and empowers them to tailor their own learning instead of coercing them into following the order and pace of standardized grade-level material.**\\n\\n*Demetria R.
