"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2021 proved to be a breakout year for cryptocurrencies, with BTC prices up nearly 70% year-over-year, Defi lock-in value reaching $150B and NFT becoming a new category. Here are my thoughts on the 2022 Crystal Ball and its impact on our industry: 1. Eth scalability will increase, but the new L1 chain will grow dramatically -- Eth's scalability challenges are likely to increase as we welcome the next billion users to use encryption and Web3. With Eth2 and many L2 aggregations, I'm optimistic about Eth scalability improvements. The traction of L1 chains such as Solana and Avalanche shows that we will live in a multi-chain world in the future. We'll also see newer L1 chains emerge that focus on specific use cases, such as gaming or social media. \\n\\n2\\\\. L1-l2 Bridge availability will improve significantly - as more AND more L1 networks gain traction and L2 becomes larger, our industry will desperately seek improvements in speed and availability across L1 and L1-L2 Bridges. We may see interesting developments in bridge usability in the coming year. \\n\\n3\\\\. Zero-knowledge proof technologies will gain more attention -- 2021 will see protocols like ZkSync and Starknet start to gain attention. With L1 chains clogging up as usage increases, zK-rollup technology will capture the attention of investors and users alike. We'll see new privacy-centric use cases emerge, including privacy-secure applications and game models that build privacy into the core. It may also cause regulators to pay more attention to encryption, as KYC/AML may be the real challenge in privacy-centric networks. \\n\\n4\\\\. Emergence of regulated Defi and on-chain KYC proofs -- many Defi protocols will be regulated and separate KYC user pools will be created. Decentralized identity and on-chain KYC authentication services will play a key role in connecting a user's real identity to a Defi wallet endpoint. We will see more acceptance of ens-type addresses, and new systems from cross-chain name resolution will emerge. \\n\\n5\\\\. Institutions will play a greater role in Defi engagement -- institutions are increasingly interested in participating in Defi. First, institutions are attracted to above-average returns compared with traditional financial products. In addition, the reduced cost of providing financial services using Defi presents interesting opportunities for institutions. However, they are still hesitant to join Defi. Institutions want to confirm that they are only dealing with known counterparties that have completed the KYC process. The growth of regulated Defi and on-chain KYC certifications will help institutions gain confidence in Defi. \\n\\n6\\\\. Defi Insurance is coming -- As Defi proliferated, it also became a target for security hackers. According to London-based Elliptic, the total value of Defi exploit losses in 2021 was more than $10B. To protect users from hackers, workable insurance agreements will emerge in 2022 to protect users' funds from security breaches. \\n\\n7\\\\. Communities based on NFT will give Web 2.0 social networks substantial competition -- NFT will continue to expand their perception. We will see creator or fan tokens occupying more first-class seats. NFT will be the next evolution in user digital identity and meta-boundary passes. Users will gather in different small communities based on the type of NFT they have. User-created metadata will be the future of social networking and will begin to threaten the ad-driven, centralized versions of today's social networks. \\n\\n8\\\\. Brands will start to actively engage with Metaverse and NFT -- many brands recognize NFT as an important tool for brand marketing and building brand loyalty. Coca-Cola, Campbell Soup, Dolce & Gabbana and Charmin released the NFT Collection in 2021. Adidas recently launched a new Metaverse project with Bored Ape Yacht Club. We are likely to see more interesting brand marketing initiatives using NFT. NFT and Metaverse will be the brand's new Instagram. As with Instagram, many brands may start with NFT native. We will also see more celebrities jumping on the bandwagon and using NFT to enhance their personal brands. \\n\\n9\\\\. Web2 companies will wake up and try to get into Web3 -- we've already seen Facebook try to reinvent itself as a Web3 company. We are likely to see other big Web2 companies dabbing in Web3 and meta festivals in 2022. However, many of these companies are likely to create centralized and closed network versions of metadata. \\n\\n10\\\\. DAO 2.0 era -- We will see DAO become more mature and mainstream. More people will join the DAO and change the definition of employment -- never receiving a formal offer, accepting tokens in lieu of or with a fixed salary, and working on multiple DAO projects simultaneously. The DAO will also face new challenges in figuring out how to make acquisitions, manage pay and benefits, and coordinate activities across a growing organization. We will see the emergence of a number of tools to help DAOs perform efficiently. Many DAOs will also figure out how to interact with traditional Web2 companies. We are likely to see regulators take more interest in DAO and try to educate themselves about how DAO works\",\"timestamp\":1641286611,\"title\":\"Blockchain industry in 2022\"},\"digest\":\"-TK4djB83z1ID1zTgL0Y4Kh4aDbXjfnid4GdSP4UXd0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x801b00155E8F721d53aACf8c2B1156287b2F7bE4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8YTLU9kwGpRrk67rBT4gljajfoYskEd9Hv7QrDTJjXc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ay5VY8nohixvBl3Arwh_-89E0c5CVGyTYMTS_awZcSY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9QMRdeAvT2wqvfMZjm6dJM-1FRteNXivbk8mkJRriCo8nCzzGc52BmgW2ZVjvLIQL6CRUXdlvY0QUtllYUmpkw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9c366c1eddd699438369faaacf0879cc6dbdac98eea8c6a34f4f54e95a94bb00258a0d1146fc328fcd418c2cb1adadc718d65823302b396e77ea7181e34252421b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8YTLU9kwGpRrk67rBT4gljajfoYskEd9Hv7QrDTJjXc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ay5VY8nohixvBl3Arwh_-89E0c5CVGyTYMTS_awZcSY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-TK4djB83z1ID1zTgL0Y4Kh4aDbXjfnid4GdSP4UXd0\"}"
