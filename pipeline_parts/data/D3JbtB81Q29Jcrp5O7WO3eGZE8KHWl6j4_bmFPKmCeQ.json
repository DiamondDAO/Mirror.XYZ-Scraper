"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2871 and 2917\\n\\n**2871 NEAR THE END OF THE LONG WAR, 50 YEARS AGO**\\n\\n\\\"Big Jake, please accept my condolences. He saved as many people as he could, a brave man. Cadmus is still reviewing the test footage.”\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Bill. I have to go, I have arrangements to make. There are some things his mother, if she was still alive, would have wanted done for him.”\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Jake. This might be the last time we talk, they're kicking me upstairs as of this week, with how the war is going to end.”\\n\\n\\\"What will happen here? Who's replacing you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Officially, they will cut operations to the bone but I can tell you the truth. We're going off book. Off-chain. Fresh blood will be taking over in a new kind of entity as this war winds down. It looks like this peace treaty has a price-tag, a new kind of post-war order you and I don't fit in.\\\"\\n\\nA young woman walked in, dressed in tactical gear, arranged in experienced field-op fashion. There was precision and ease in her walk.\\n\\n\\\"Director, you sent for me?\\\" said the young woman, who stood at attention.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, come in Special Agent. Big Jake, speaking of 'fresh blood', I thought you might want to meet the future of this agency.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Commander Tagore, it's an honor to meet you, sir. I wanted to thank you. You saved a lot of lives, myself included, during the worst of it these last couple of years. We are indebted to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The honor is mine, Special Agent...?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Smith, sir. Jane Smith.\\\" The Commander smiled at what was an alias.\\n\\n\\\"Big Jake, Special Agent Smith is part of a new breed. She ranked at the top of her cohort for her field work. When I leave here, this desk is hers to fly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sir??\\\" The cool of the young agent was for a moment broken.\\n\\n\\\"That's right, Smith. Our way of doing things is changing with a changing world. You will be in charge of a new entity to protect this world's interests years after everyone has forgotten about this war. You'll carry the flame.\\\"\\n\\n**2917 Mars Intelligence HQ**\\n\\n\\\"Director Smith, the latest reports of the explosion at Earth's Necklace are in. Diplomatic storm right now. Earth getting locked down. A lot of confusion on the ground. The Triumvirate is in crisis mode.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good. What about exfiltration team? Did it go as he planned for this worst case? We planned for all outcomes, including this one, as best as we could.”\\n\\n\\\"The Sgt. Major reports the solar skiff was able to stealth into position. In the confusion of the explosions, it was able to get into position for caption. He's on board a diplomatic ship, in a secure ICU unit on board. Our specialists are creating official records of death for him and the team. Tragic news for the Trade Association will be part of the official statements.”\\n\\n\\\"Good. His father would have been impressed. Let's review cover stories for this industrial tragedy.\\\" \\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr., under heavy medical care, was on board a diplomatic ship returning to Mars.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wxbssXqvHpUnQWTXsIoVF.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633902117,\"title\":\"1961: 5.28 Afterparty In The Afterlife, 2871, 2917\"},\"digest\":\"3y9rkrcUyGE5MUnG7FBEmL9sVuGG5TOx26saCDWBMF8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cIcnch4GuVKlWYODYhxnLG6H_-q5EFp2b21qCuftOAxYCyGVkN1SD_5wWnOY9UbLRRCb4cZ59Lf98KvJMy6Ddw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3y9rkrcUyGE5MUnG7FBEmL9sVuGG5TOx26saCDWBMF8\"}"
