"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## The community /is/ the platform. Beem is a toolbox for creators to craft new video content and live experiences with their communities, monetize their work, and make the jump into the Open Metaverse, while maintaining control over their intellectual property.\\n\\n## üí° Entering the ownership economy\\n\\nThe [most recent study](https://newcreatormanifesto.com/?v=a) on the creator‚Äôs economy shows the stark reality of those who we watch, like, and follow on social media:\\n\\n* **93%** say that being a creator has **negatively impacted their lives**\\n* **65%** feel **overworked** and/or **underpaid**\\n* **89%** are interested in a new, radical way of **building a business as a creator**\\n\\nAs a result, a new wave of independent creators is emerging, paving the way for the **[ownership economy](https://darkstar.mirror.xyz/srmoGiN_1pg_toQGzCupkjWFOaf8xi0mM60zYpn_pwI)**:\\n\\n* Transform the audience they currently rent from the major social media platforms into real communities with **direct-to-fan relationship and content distribution**\\n* Regain the benefits of their **communities‚Äô network effects** by using those social media platforms to funnel new fans into their own space that they fully control\\n* **Earn money directly** from their community and [most loyal fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/)\\n* **Manage and distribute ownership** using Web3 technologies, in particular NFTs - [Non-Fungible Tokens](https://digiday.com/media/wtf-is-an-nft/), unique digital assets representing certificates of ownership or access to specific items. Crypto‚Äôs central tenet is ‚Äúpower to the people‚Äù, which is shared by independent creators looking to create collectivized and community-centric ecosystems\\n\\n## üß© A Web3-ready video toolbox\\n\\n[Beem](http://info.watchbeem.com/) has developed a **set of video and community engagement tools** that are aligned since inception with the aspirations and needs of independent creators. We started working on these challenges in early 2018 (stealth name: Unchained, check out our [whitepaper](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmUYNKWy8JLwfvKL1zbHebNPzCDxbbJCGMrAA3MQexTEkJ)) based on the principle that **NFTs will power [Web3](https://medium.com/fabric-ventures/what-is-web-3-0-why-it-matters-934eb07f3d2b)**, the next evolution of the digital economy, thanks to tokenized content ownership, decentralized intellectual property rights management, programmatic royalties and digital collectibles.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/I9xr9Q5M2uqj9gqbdwoa5.png?height=898&width=1600)\\n\\nWe knew that the video space was the most promising and we set our aim at creating a **complete blockchain-based video infrastructure for creators and their communities**. But in 2018, Web3 technologies and UX were not yet ready for mass-market deployment and adoption, so we focused our efforts on building the most challenging part: a **scalable high-performance, low-latency video full stack**. We tested it, launched it, and market-proved it. Creators and audiences alike loved it!\\n\\nMoving forward, we are now creating a **seamless interface** between the performance and usability of Web2 and the Web3 tools and models that will allow the ownership economy to flourish.\\n\\nWe believe NFTs can solve most of the shortfalls of digital media creation, ownership, and monetization. That‚Äôs why in the next 12 months we will be deploying NFT [smart contracts](https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts) at the core of our system to unlock a whole set of new features to empower creators and their communities:\\n\\n* **Token-gating** (only people with a specific asset in their wallet are able to access an event or a video), fan subscriptions, and digital collectibles\\n* **Fans‚Äô genuine stake ownership** in a creator‚Äôs work through collaboration in the creative process and contribution of time and money, as well as exclusive access passes, premium content unlocks, and voting rights on a project‚Äôs direction ([social tokens](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesfinancecouncil/2021/09/20/social-tokens-a-web-30-playbook-for-monetizing-yourself/?sh=4bc167d12e44))\\n* **Intellectual property** and **royalty management** of the creator‚Äôs content\\n* **Automatic split** of revenues, royalties and ownership between different participants of the community,¬†opening the door to **media Distributed Autonomous Organizations** ([DAOs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2021/06/01/what-are-daos-and-why-you-should-pay-attention/)).\\n\\n## ‚≠êÔ∏è Loved by creators, cheered by their community\\n\\nOn Beem, creators can **upload their video content**, **distribute it** easily for free or for a fee, and **create interactive live events** with their content in a few clicks with full ticketing management. They can invite guests and **fans on stage** and interact seamlessly with their communities via **live video and chat**. Participants can join from any device (desktop browser, iOS and Android apps) and easily cast the show to their TV through Airplay or Chromecast. Creators can also stream their event to the major social media platforms such as YouTube Live, Twitch or Facebook Live to reach the largest audience possible and funnel it into their own space on Beem for **higher interactivity** and **greater monetization**. The content created during these live events is recorded and then available to be replayed.¬†Creators can **get paid in cash or in crypto**, as we natively accept both forms of payment and multiple monetization solutions: **ticketing**, **pay-per-view**, brands **sponsorships**, **tips** and **fundraising**. Soon, each piece of content, event ticket and content access key created on Beem will be an **NFT**, unlocking real content ownership and direct fandom relationships.\\n\\nSince our soft launch in October 2020, creators have used Beem to host **live concerts**, **podcast recordings**, **interactive workshops**, **film premieres**, **festivals** with **live Q&As**, and engaging **fundraisers**. Beem has provided a unique stage for thousands of public and private events, with tens of thousands of user registrations, and dozens of thousands USD raised for nonprofits and cultural projects. We gained invaluable feedback from both our creators and their communities.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KkfhyZ8ibHJTGE_8R9CzN.png?height=3954&width=6906)\\n\\nWe confirmed a core assumption of our product: after experiencing a **unified toolkit** like Beem, creators don‚Äôt plan to go back to the messy patchwork of Zoom, YouTube Live, Vimeo, Streamyard, Eventbrite, Mailchimp, Patreon, and the dozen other tools they currently use to grow their business, connect with their communities and monetize their content.\\n\\nDon‚Äôt take our word for it, [check out the feedback we got](https://vimeo.com/639859358):\\n\\n![https://vimeo.com/639859358](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XYQFJFBjuPmrcdF0za7eP.png?height=535&width=958)\\n\\nFor established creators and businesses wishing to operate and own their space, our **white-label solution** **Beem Pro** is fully customizable with the **URL**, **identity**, **branding**, **content** and **events**. They have the tools to directly manage their community, access the analytics about their live events, content distribution, and revenues while maintaining full ownership of their content and data.\\n\\n## üåê Jumping into the Open Metaverse\\n\\nWe are bullish on the **[Open Metaverse](https://spectrum.ieee.org/open-metaverse)** becoming the next major evolution of our digital lives, societies and economies.\\n\\nIn 2021 **NFTs went mainstream** as more and more people and [large corporations](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/spongebob-nft-viacomcbs-recur-1235088069/#!) understand their use and huge potential. Indeed, NFTs can carry multiple characteristics and underlying values: more or less **exclusive characters** ([Bored Apes](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bored-ape-yacht-club-the-celebrity-nft-of-choice), [Cool Cats](https://www.coolcatsnft.com/), etc.), **virtual real estate** (in [SandBox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/) maybe next to [Snoop Dogg‚Äôs mansion](https://medium.com/sandbox-game/the-sandbox-partners-with-snoop-dogg-to-bring-legendary-rapper-into-the-metaverse-e064e866ed40) - owned by himself), a piece of **generative art** ([Art Blocks](https://www.artblocks.io/) collections) or a **music album** ([Daniel Allan](https://twitter.com/imdanielallan) is paying back 50% of his royalties to token holders who funded his EP). NFTs become (part of) our online identity and signal our fanship and emotional attachment while allowing us to join a community we care about. *‚ÄúCome for the assets, stay for the experience‚Äù,* as [Fred Wilson recently put it](https://avc.com/2021/10/web3-vs-web2/).\\n\\n![do you have your Snoop Dogg private party pass?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YiCMGSDpRUf0iddDHJZ4g.png?height=433&width=691)\\n\\n**Blockchains are the fabric of the Open Metaverse** and **NFTs are the building blocks.**\\n\\nThe Open Metaverse can be described as an evolving collection of highly **composable technologies** and **transferable assets** across projects and networks, guided by a [set of principles and frameworks](https://outlierventures.io/research/the-open-metaverse-os/), where digital assets and identities are [interconnected, fluid and interoperable](https://medium.com/bosonprotocol/open-metaverse-commerce-interoperability-and-the-need-to-avoid-value-capture-5f72eae42dd8). **Enhanced visualization** (virtual worlds, AR, VR), **gamification** (open games, play-to-earn), content & personal brand **creation and ownership**, decentralization (democratized and permissionless playfield), and the financial instruments of **DeFi** (Decentralized Finance) all converge into this Open Metaverse.\\n\\nWe are committed to **creating interoperable assets** as well as **integrating** any external asset relevant to communities to take maximum advantage of their **utility**. Any asset created on Beem will be accessible in any other on-chain ‚Äúworld‚Äù within the Open Metaverse, and conversely, any asset from other worlds could soon be brought inside Beem: currencies, avatars, 3D wearables, in-game goods, piece of art, media or code represented as an NFT, etc. Anyone will be able to showcase their NFTs live on stage, use them as their avatar or 3D model on camera, in the chat, and in their profile, and maintain their Metaverse identities inside their virtual communities.\\n\\nWe believe Beem will become a **powerful on-ramp** to **seamlessly** and massively **onboard communities**, **content** and **assets** from Web2 into the Open Metaverse.\\n\\nWe started on the **Ethereum** blockchain, but we believe in a **multi-chain future** and are already integrating other chains and [Layer 2s](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-cryptocurrency-layer-2-scaling-solutions). By allowing creators to mint NFTs with the metadata stored on **decentralized storage** (like IPFS or Arweave), the content (media + metadata) is **interoperable** and doesn't depend on a centralized infrastructure. This makes Beem a streamlined and **transparent IP ownership solution for video creators** who want to securely store and distribute their content. Creators are in **full control of their content** and can use it on Beem or on any compatible open ecosystem.\\n\\n![simplified view of the decentralized infrastructure](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/M2VNw3aDodvt6DL8jrZEi.png?height=1022&width=1409)\\n\\n## üôã Take ownership of Beem\\n\\nNow the best part: we want you to be part of our journey towards becoming the most useful Web3 video toolbox. Our objective is to **raise $10M in the coming year** to execute on our bold vision. On top of VCs, it is of paramount importance for us to give you, our early community, the ability to **invest and get your fair share** of Beem‚Äôs success. Likewise, we‚Äôve **reserved equity** to **reward Beem‚Äôs most committed creators**. It‚Äôs time for creators to become **stakeholders in their means of production**! If we are to make Beem a huge success, we want this success to be shared.\\n\\n*‚ÄúThe ownership economy is the idea that in the future, all platforms will be built, operated, and owned by their users.

It behaves like a traditional [SAFE](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/) (Simple Agreement for Future Equity - a model pioneered by Y Combinator), except that it‚Äôs continuous, i.e. there are no rounds happening every now and then reserved for a select few. Indeed, we wanted our rolling SAFE to be as inclusive and fair as possible:\\n\\n* **Inclusive**: our rolling SAFE never closes, it is literally **always open for investment**. You can invest today, tomorrow, in a few months or next year\\n* **Fair**: the earlier you invest, the more attractive valuation you‚Äôll secure.
