In doing so, it will drive even more consumer interest, facilitate even more new entrants and enable even more innovation to take place.”\\n\\n“For consumers, these changes will establish a regulatory framework to underpin their growing use of crypto assets and clarify the treatment of new payment methods,” he added.\\n\\nOne Senate committee proposal the government looks set to ignore is the 10% tax discount for Bitcoin miners who use renewable energy. Michael Harris, head of corporate development at local exchange Swyftx, told Cointelegraph:\\n\\n> “We think this was a political consideration. The reality is that it’s probably going to be difficult for any government to segregate out an industry like BTC mining from other energy consumers, however laudable the intention.”\\n\\nHowever, Harris said that overall, the “noises coming out of government at the moment are promising,” as the government seems to have recognized the need to introduce consumer protection laws [without stifling innovation](https://cointelegraph.com/news/proposed-tightening-of-australian-crypto-regulations-could-stifle-competition-kraken).\\n\\n> “The devil will be in the detail, though, and we are especially keen to avoid a system that reduces customer choice by stacking the decks in favor of big, traditional financial players.”\\n\\n***Related: [Australian women owning crypto has doubled in 2021: Survey](https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-women-owning-crypto-has-doubled-in-2021-survey)***\\n\\n[Crypto-friendly Senator](https://cointelegraph.com/news/aussie-crypto-companies-keen-to-embrace-regulations-says-senator) Andrew Bragg, who drove the recent crypto proposals, told Cointelegraph in a statement that Frydenberg’s crypto and fintech reform plan will put “Australia on the tech map”:\\n\\n> “Australia will be a world-leading crypto hub under the Treasurer’s plan. Australian consumers will also benefit from new consumer protection rules.”\\n\\n“The world is watching Australia, which is now setting the global standard for crypto, payments and digital wallet reform,” he added.\\n\\nCaroline Bowler, CEO of local crypto exchange BTC Markets, welcomed the reforms, calling them a “major step forward to upgrade Australia’s one-size-fits-all regulatory framework in real-time.”\\n\\n“It’s great to see that the gaps in Australian regulation relating to digital financial products and the exchanges who support them are being finally addressed at the highest level of authority, and the Coalition Government is not shying away from the big issues surrounding crypto, payments and de-banking,” she said.\",\"timestamp\":1639381865,\"title\":\"Australian government gives nod to 6 world-leading crypto reforms\"},\"digest\":\"tABXUyi-_7o7Y71z1cEruZxKOSziNVoT0QG6V5n0hXg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6d63A9e0f572bb7D7A0C1F493Da4D3b040a44205\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MGXlBIhsqEqe-dzpPHd6gfhJNwOSQgay9HyM4_h3Zfk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O72U7WcqjgDMvw8cT7fFhr1lgP3jK25zasdXS78XsKY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tfk5t3-RcRc3y-ohyqGA1ECpvTAsrCIk-WMPFhvoxyVsQJWMtugJb_Rwn5wm2IvNFwgwG7DFHhxhQYqaKDIzaw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0412dc4c1f162dcf7f5f169e85d809c595f26577ae894c924eb28c99dd3d08730da8d2eeaa6e701580288365b634d35e2226f48c2d7ae3b990869ead477f3481c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MGXlBIhsqEqe-dzpPHd6gfhJNwOSQgay9HyM4_h3Zfk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"O72U7WcqjgDMvw8cT7fFhr1lgP3jK25zasdXS78XsKY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tABXUyi-_7o7Y71z1cEruZxKOSziNVoT0QG6V5n0hXg\"}"
