"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As we all know by now, the information you consume matters a great deal in shaping your mind. Since we only have limited time and scarce attention while the supply never stops, the idea of an 'information diet' just resonates perfectly with those who care about their content intakes.  \\n  \\n The basic logic and instruction of such a diet is to handpick the good from the bad and be selective of what you read and watch, so we could all be healthier and happier. In practice, people have tuned this basics to different degrees: some have become digital minimalist, strictly controlling the amount of information they consume; others only care about the quality but can be as voracious as those who are not on a diet; and the rest sit somewhere in between.  \\n  \\n If the variation in practice could be so wide, what does it really mean to be an information dieter? The justification of the diet relies on some key premises:  \\n\\n1. **It's impossible to read all the information and you should make your own choice.** The amount of information being generated now is just far beyond human's capacity to digest, so there is actually no other way but to read only a segment of it. If you don't choose what you read, your time will be filled up by other people's choice. It's better to take control. \\n2. **It's about being better-informed rather than being omniscient.** To know everything is pointless, because most information are statistically not worth knowing. To the contrary, 'junk' information will make you ill-informed and misled, so it's better to just read what is nutritious. \\n3. **The value of information (hence the criterion for selection) is determined by its quality and how useful it is** to the reader, and reader knows how to judge the usefulness of a specific piece of information. \\n4. **To control your diet is to control your source of information.** Information is like water, good content comes from good source, so if you control the feed, then you control the quality of information. \\n\\nWhile all of the above are of critical value, they neglect, at the same time, some other key elements. And this has brought problems. \\n\\n# The Problems with Information Diet\\n\\nIf you ever try to implement a diet on your content consumption, you'd very likely come to notice a series of inconvenient side effects very soon: \\n\\n1. **It's hard to discover new feeds.** Your feeds will probably grow naturally as you continue to encounter references from your existing list, but it's hard to discover heterogeneous contents and it's very easy to fall into the echo chamber.  \\n \\n2. **An diet implies a rather static perspective on information.** It's important to choose your feeds, but it's equally important to update them as they grow, evolve or deteriorate. Now, managing feeds is a work of prediction: you have to judge the future by the present, but it's not always reliable.  \\n \\n3. **It's not only about being better informed, ultimately it should be about better thinking.** To think better, you need to have well-rounded information, information that speaks on both sides. But a diet does not provide a place for evaluation of individual piece of information. The foundation of a diet is your trust- you have to trust them enough to put them in your diet, but trust undermines your judgement and objectivity, which is offsetting the purpose of gathering information in the first place. \\n\\n# Brecht and Information's Verfremdungseffekt\\n\\nBertolt Brecht is a German theater practitioner who popularized the concept of 'Verfremdungseffekt', which is also translated as the 'estrangement effect' or 'distancing effect'. \\n  \\n Brecht first used the term in an essay on \\\"Alienation Effects in Chinese Acting\\\" published in 1936, in which he described it as \\\"playing in such a way that the audience was hindered from simply identifying itself with the characters in the play. Acceptance or rejection of their actions and utterances was meant to take place on a conscious plane, instead of, as hitherto, in the audience's subconscious\\\"\\\\[1\\\\]. \\n  \\n When the play and acting on stage is good, it's all too easy for the audience to just follow the plot and believe whatever they see. In short, estrangement effect refers to the device of making the familiar feel strange again by invoking active and conscious participation from the audience. **I think we need a similar device for our information intake, a way to break the default.** As it comes to information, we often assume the role of a passive audience: we read as if we are watching a play, we identify with the narrative as it manifests itself in front of us. We are there, and we enjoy the information. \\n  \\n **Having an information diet is like going to a good theater: it's better than going to the bad ones, but if you still watch the play in the same passive way, your relationship with the play will not change. You feel like your are in charge, but you are actually the one being played, by the good writing, good argument, and worst of all, good algorithm.** \\n  \\n It's time we take back the real control, the control of our relationship with information. No more should we take what we read for granted; nor should we care only if something is making sense, but discern why and how it is making sense. \\n\\n# A Paradigm Shift\\n\\nThis calls for a paradigm shift. \\n\\n1. **From dieter to picker.** The diet analogy is obsolete: there is little dispute over the constitution of a healthy diet and the recipe of such a diet doesn't need to change much over time once it's designed to fit your need; we just need to follow that diet and we will be fine. The crux of a diet is to look internally, focusing on what you need and try to fulfill that with a fixed plan.  \\n But when it comes to information, we need to keep abreast of the outside world and be in the loop. We don't need all the information, but we need to be out there and seize what is valuable NOW and HERE. That's why I think we should be picker instead of dieter. A picker is watching the environment all the time, they know when the fruit is ripe, where the trees are, and the best way to pick different fruits. To be a good picker is to know that even the same tree could have fruits of different quality from time to time.  \\n \\n2. **From controlling to interacting.** The old information diet emphasize the need to control your feeds, but it never mentions how to interact with the information you gather from your feeds. To build a good feed list is to create a smaller nurturing environment out of this big messy world, but it's not like serving these information to your table. You don't have to eat them all even if you are a digital minimalist. But you're never supposed to interact with information that way. For me, the best way to treat your feeds is to see them as a city and[ observe the street](https://forty-five.com/papers/under-the-banner-of-street-observation).  \\n \\n3. **From healthy to robust.** To stay healthy, you need to avoid misinformation and disinformation and to diversify your information sources, like you need to eat[ a wide variety of foods ](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/)and avoiding junk foods. It's not easy but it's also not enough. To become robust, you also need to introduce some germs, information that's unpleasant at first sight or even dangerous, but they can help you train your system to [call bullshit ](https://www.callingbullshit.org/)underneath the seemingly well-grounded arguments. \\n\\n**So, don't just sit tight.
