There weren’t many people playing on that platform, but I believe it was a good platform, and I couldn’t get much money for the coins I earned, but in March, April, April, and May of the following year, those coins turned out to be a huge fortune, i’m close to making half a bitcoin, about one hundred and three a day over winter break. For a student, this is indeed a great fortune.\\n\\n过年的时候，我在褥羊毛赚币打算换柚子，当时是熊市底部。那个平台根本没多少人玩，但是我相信，这是一个不错的平台，我赚的币换不了多少钱，但是来年年三四月份四五月份，那些币变成了，一笔巨大的财富，我接近赚了半个比特币，大概一算寒假时每天能赚个一百二三。对于一个学生而言，这确实是一笔巨大的财富。\\n\\n6月1日柚子暴跌损失惨重\\n\\nAt that time, the grapefruit rose slowly. B 1 was going to release some blockbuster product on June 1, so I stayed up late looking at it, and I had a lot of orders on an exchange, and as a result, the market went up, and the damn sharing mechanism spread out, and I predicted that there would be a big market for pomelo, and I kept going, unfortunately, the results were revealed, at this time, I was surprised to find that my original many orders have not been spread out, has not found the transaction records, but I clearly remember in an hour, my contract income has been increasing constantly, so I confronted the customer service, who told me to take a screenshot and ask what I wanted. I had to remove the APP from the exchange, and never went to the exchange again to cash in my money.\\n\\n当时，柚子慢慢的涨起来了。B1打算在6月1日，发布一些重磅的产品，于是我熬夜在看，而且手上在某交易所开了多单，结果，行情上涨，该死的分摊机制分摊了，我预测柚子会有一波大行情，继续开多，结果不幸被爆，就在这时，我惊讶的发现，我当初的多单并没有被分摊，已经找不到交易记录了，但是我明明记得在一个小时的时间里，我的合约收益一直在不断的增多，于是我质问客服，客服让我拿出截图证据并问我有什么诉求。，我只得心塞的删除了这家交易所的APP，从此再也没有去这家交易所变现币乎赚的key了。\\n\\nLater, I was watching the press conference, only to see the foreigners on the stage talking, suddenly stopped, the live commentator said it seemed to be over, and then the grapefruit continued to fall, fell to my heart hurts. The Message to me this time is, 1. A central exchange is a god’s vision, and you can’t help it if he says so. Two. To pay attention to the configuration, the currency of any track should be configured a bit, heavy position of a currency, too big risk. (gradually, I began to configure other coins, so that if the grapefruit went to zero, I could get my money back as soon as the bitcoin went up.)\\n\\n后来我又在看发布会，只见台上的外国人讲着讲着，突然停了，讲解直播的人一脸懵逼说好像结束了，然后柚子继续下跌，跌得我心口都疼。这次给我的感悟是，1。中心化的交易所的确是上帝视角，他说什么就是什么，你也没有办法。2。要注意配置，任何赛道的币都要配置一点，重仓某一种币，风险太大。（后来我渐渐的，配置了一些别的币，即使柚子归零，只要比特币涨起来，我就能回本）\\n\\n加BitcoinClub群，慢慢明白了比特币是个财富仓库\\n\\nLater on Weibo, someone posted that if you join his group, you can send 2,000 smart bitcoins. And then I added it, and there were a lot of big shots in there. They all have high levels of bitcoin awareness, and some people have a lot of bitcoin. At the same time, I was reading some coin circle books, such as the self-cultivation of leeks, the investment notes of the old cat and so on. Gradually I realized that bitcoin is indeed an excellent storehouse of wealth, you can transfer money without going through the agency. And I learned that nine gods, according to him, if the stored value function of bitcoin is widely recognized 20 years from now, the price of bitcoin will be 160 million RMB per coin. (and this is his most conservative estimate.) I wouldn’t believe it if I didn’t have a deep understanding of bitcoin, but, as I’ve learned more and more about bitcoin, I’m sure it’s going to go up to a price that’s going to raise everyone’s eyebrows, it’s not necessarily that expensive.\\n\\n后来在微博上，有人发帖子说只要加他的群，那就送2000聪的比特币。后来我加了进去，发现里面确实有很多大佬。他们的对比特币认知都挺高的，而且有的人有很多比特币。与此同时，我在看一些币圈的书，比如韭菜的自我修养，老猫的投资笔记之类的，渐渐的我明白了，比特币的确实是个优异的财富仓库，比特币不可增发，不可被抄没，可以不经过机构就可以转账。而且我还知道了9神，据他所说如果20年后比特币的储值功能得到广泛公认的话，比特币的价格将会是1.6亿人民币一枚。（而且这是他最保守的估计）如果没有深刻的了解比特币，我是不会信的，但是，经过我对比特币的不断了解，我相信他会涨到一个，所有人都瞠目结舌的价格，虽然不一定是那么贵。\\n\\n加场外杠杆加仓主流币\\n\\nBefore long, the price of bitcoin was falling. I borrowed some money off the market and bought Bitcoin, and then bitcoin went down, and I bought it, and I bought it, and I bought it, and I got trapped.\\n\\n不久之后，比特币的价格不断下跌。我在场外借了点钱买了，买了比特币，不久之后比特币又跌了，我又买，又跌了，我又买，然后就被套了。\\n\\n孙宇晨巴菲特慈善午餐爆仓\\n\\nAt that time, I played some capital plate, a few hundred dollars into the money but can not withdraw, but a pity my several hundred dollars of living expenses. Later, some people said that Buffett’s charity lunch may let Sun Yuchen on camera, after my research, I think this matter, basically can confirm the city really. One Night Sun Yuchen finally tweeted, so he immediately do more wave field. I was very careful, I was only 10 times as careful, I just opened my front hand, a few seconds later, I was half-eaten, and then it exploded, and then the text came. The lesson for me this time is that contracts are really not for the average person to play with, even if you make a lot of money in front of you, you can take it away if you make a mistake once. Of course, there is no right or wrong way to use a contract as a tool. You can use it to magnify your gains or to hedge your risks.\\n\\n当时我玩了一些资金盘，充了钱几百块钱进去却提不出来，可惜了我那几百块钱的生活费。后来，有人说巴菲特的慈善午餐有可能让孙宇晨拍上了，经过我的调查研究，我觉得这件事，基本可以确定市真的。有一天晚上孙宇晨终于发微博了，于是立马做多波场。当时我还是非常谨慎的，只开了10倍，我前手刚开，几秒后就腰斩，接着立马爆仓，然后短信来了。这次给我的教训是，合约真的不是普通人能玩的 即使你前面赚了无数的财富，后面只要错一次就能一把带走。当然，合约作为工具本身没有对错，你可以用来放大收益，也可以用来对冲风险。\\n\\n玩力场，加仓力场\\n\\nPlaying force field, plus warehouse force field\\n\\n然后我又开始玩力场，后来我发现力场还挺不错的，于是就开始逐步加仓，锁仓。我大概买了100万的lc，虽然按柚子本位没有赚多少，但是我相信，这一类的币在牛市高点，你特别不怎么长的时候，才是lc大放异彩的时候，\\n\\nAnd then I started playing with the force field, and then I found that the force field was pretty good, so I started adding positions and locking positions. I bought about a million LC, although the grapefruit standard does not earn much, but I believe that this type of currency in the Bull Market High Point, you are not very long, that is when LC shine,\\n\\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20200425/7ca0063d7286ad3be60caf446c0d817f_GIZDAKRSGIYA.jpeg)\\n\\n20年\\n\\n鲸交所最低杠杆质押柚子加仓比特币，3.12差点爆仓\\n\\n过年前后比特币终于涨破1万，所有的人都兴高采烈，看好减半牛，不久行情回调，可遇不可求的机会出现了。我鲸鱼交所按最低的杠杆抵押了几乎所有的柚子换成了比特币，随着疫情的发展，加上当时所有的人有过分的乐观，市场流动性危机，所有的币都开始下跌，跌到6000的时候有人看5000，4000。结果真的跌到了5000，所有的人都看的更低了，早上起来，比特币继续下跌。我绝望了，柚子的质押率从50变成了60，70，接近嗯，80，接着继续跌。我想要不要把手上的比特币卖了，增加质押率，防止爆仓，然而我想到还要还场外杠杆的钱，于是我心一横我就不看了。终于比特币在3800美元企稳，然后慢慢上涨，虽然后面还跌了一次，但我已经放开了。当时群里都开玩笑说，这几天就不要出门了，免得上气不接下气，让别人误以为得了新冠状肺炎。接着行情就不断的回暖了，不断的有人踏空。这次给我的教训是，囤币是不能带一点杠杆的，而且低杠杆也是非常危险的，你会忍不住的增加质押，而高杠杆虽然容易爆仓，却能被动的止损。还有一点就是比特币是风险资产，即使说他是避险资产，也只能说是避货币增发的险，流动性危机啥都得跌。\\n\\n慢慢回血加仓\\n\\n后面就是慢慢的加仓，有点闲钱就买柚子了。\\n\\n守币如守寡，太难了。\\n\\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20200425/74db5eca0976a45ab8acb591a3af7909_GY4DIKRUGMZA.jpg)\\n\\n总结，展望牛市：\\n\\n1\\\\.注意配置，我们要赚的是数字货币，区块链产业发展的红利，而不是赌某一个币，将来会暴涨，这样风险真的太大了。\\n\\n2\\\\. 不要玩杠杆，最好囤主流币。杠杆风险真的太大了。数字货币将来的涨幅绝对是非常大的。如果牛市来了，你的币没了，不很可惜吗？\\n\\n3\\\\.就是不要看空任何的项目，任何项目只要牛市来了都会涨，就是涨多涨少，涨早涨晚的问题。\\n\\n4\\\\.不要相信任何的交易所，要去中心化交易所，三大交易所加冷钱包分散储存。\\n\\n5\\\\.共识不是靠大家认可，而且靠事实。黄金是物理事实，大饼是数学事实。数学可能比物理更可靠。而且现在币圈的资金盘骗局，都在拿比特币的各种优点来哄骗老人，如果你还体会不到比特币的优越性，说明你确实需要好好的学习一下了。\\n\\n6\\\\.就像世纪末的互联网泡沫，虽然当时泡沫破灭了，但是总的方向是正确的，只不过需要时间不断的发展，因此不能追涨杀跌，要囤主流币，做时间的朋友。\\n\\n币圈大佬分享\\n\\n1\\\\.江卓尔 ，江卓尔是莱比特的创始人，比特币投资者，科普者。他创呢的莱比特矿池是国内顶尖的矿池，2017年牛市最高峰时曾达到过全球算力第一，2017年他在知乎上写的文章，《比特币是什么》<https://www.zhihu.com/question/22076666/answer/69638270> 截至目前已经有600万的浏览量，而且他在17年年底比特币价格高点成功逃顶，18年，成功预测比特币可能跌到3000美元左右。但是他短期预测的并不太行，而且他不知为什么，异常的看好比特币的分叉币bch。虽然我认为bch在明年的涨幅可能会超过比特币，但是我认为，bch就是bch。\\n\\n2\\\\.9神（微博ahr999）9神是囤比特币的创作者，他提出的ahr999指数非常适合于只是比特币最近的价格的高低，适合囤币，他似乎把囤比特币做成了一生的事业，别的任何币都不碰。虽然他这样会错过很多的机遇。但是比特币的储值功能是区块链世界最最最长久的。其次，他在非比特币领域的发言的确是，让人大跌眼镜。\\n\\n3\\\\.区块链威廉  文章认识很高，我关于法币以及比特币的很多知识，都是来源于他，推荐大家关注。\\n\\n4\\\\.梓岑  当初就是他提出的奶王语录，<https://bihu.com/article/1731012719> 虽然柚子的价格现在并不显眼，但是柚子确实是最有希望成为下个以太的公链。梓岑每周六都在一直播毫无保留的直播分享他的观点。我觉得他的直播很值得看。<https://bihu.com/article/1704552228>\\n\\n5\\\\.比特傻  比特傻是币乎认知特别高的存在。他写过的文章都特别的好，认知也很新颖，而且他提出的空谷钱雨理论，引领我不要脸的找同学要手机号，验证码褥羊毛。他写的《人间奥义资金盘》<https://bihu.com/article/1153441858> 让我对这个世界有了更深刻的认知。\\n\\n币圈好书分享\\n\\n1\\\\.《比特币白皮书》，https://[www.8btc.com/wiki/bitcoin-a-peer-to-peer-electronic-cash-system](http://www.8btc.com/wiki/bitcoin-a-peer-to-peer-electronic-cash-system) 这是比特币创始人中本聪写的关于比特币的论文，首次提到了比特币，这一伟大的发明。区块链世界所有的一切，最初的根本。\\n\\n2\\\\.《精通比特币》，这本书非常详细的写了比特币的各种架构原理，加深了我对其安全性以以及未来无限可能的认同。\\n\\n3\\\\.《韭菜的自我修养》，这本书是李笑来老师的著作，是我看的第一本有关币圈的书，我们可以从书中找到很多有用的东西。\\n\\n4\\\\.《猫说投资笔记》，这是老猫写的自己的投资笔记，我是在这本书中找到“数字货币是更好的钱”这一观点，这本书也写了，老猫自己的投资认知。也推荐大家阅读学习。\\n\\n5\\\\. 《比特币是什么》江卓尔<https://www.zhihu.com/question/22076666/answer/69638270> 这个链接，之前提到过，也推荐大家阅读，学习。\\n\\n好评送key\\n\\n币乎：\\n\\n20字以上评论即可，分别发放\\n\\n10\\\\*500key＋18\\\\*300key  总共10400key\\n\\n欢迎大家点赞评论和转发，最终解释权归作者比特币收割机所有。\\n\\n力场\\n\\n20字以上评论即可，分别发放\\n\\n20\\\\*1000lc+30\\\\*800lc  总共44000lc\\n\\n欢迎欢迎点赞评论和转发，最终解释权归作者比特币收割机所有。\\n\\n![](https://oss-cdn1.bihu-static.com/image/20200425/a830925e2def690f48ebbcfb8b25f3d2_GIZDAKRSGIYA.jpg)\\n\\n好评奖励将在27号24点前发放完毕\",\"timestamp\":1634057275,\"title\":\"进入币圈两年的经历，感悟和分享（已预约暴击，好评赢红包，规则在文末）\"},\"digest\":\"6uKBacxdKPSUeb9EF0GjjyuWriaKipSEPcmheDX9RJI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x374cB27a8753520bb153906a0a34Cc823cEA3C3e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qdu2wAnzbSilgky2qRV16xqHA3VwU0h824YQf2672Q0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4xpiECJxMm5COKCGIpFX8Ah7e39KAXee-hBOT-mLM6Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"20XXHC8aERddCLJBbDZEYrblJZq5zzAL0tn1KaqDFb5S-QH6fTkyp7SrEVTerMypUQNLZz6CWpcenzMpvfFVSQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf6b433ced99741e59ba448f747bd8f5a2c0da276f6dc6d191b6038c174faef5936f9c06de15151687e59a555250e27cd455fd7b7f945ff2672847f3d234260891c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qdu2wAnzbSilgky2qRV16xqHA3VwU0h824YQf2672Q0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4xpiECJxMm5COKCGIpFX8Ah7e39KAXee-hBOT-mLM6Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6uKBacxdKPSUeb9EF0GjjyuWriaKipSEPcmheDX9RJI\"}"
