"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Dissociation is a topic that has been on my mind a lot lately. I first became interested in the phenomenon after I received training in EMDR  (Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing – a type of therapy most noted for the treatment of PTSD). Because dissociation can be common amongst individuals with childhood trauma, EMDR clinicians are trained to carefully screen for symptoms of dissociation before beginning this therapy with someone seeking to reduce symptoms of their PTSD or co-occurring disorders. \\n\\nLike many mental health conditions, dissociation occurs on a spectrum – at the less extreme end, dissociation looks like daydreaming and “highway hypnosis” – driving on autopilot on a route you’ve driven many times before. On the more extreme end, you have derealization (feeling as though your surroundings aren’t real) or depersonalization (feeling as though you aren’t real, that you’re dead, or that you are watching yourself from a 3rd person perspective). Take it up another very large notch, and you have Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly called Multiple Personality Disorder). This is a condition that is hotly contested, even in the world of therapy. I believe that one reason there is still skepticism of the validity of DID is that we do not fully understand it (yet). \\n\\nThere are a few different thoughts on why some people develop dissociation to a clinical level (clinical = causing major impairment in our lives). The most popular belief among the psychotherapy community is that dissociation develops as an evolutionary safety mechanism that is activated when a child suffers persistent trauma (physical, sexual or other trauma). When a child suffers cruelty from the perpetrator, the child’s mind and body instinctively activate our built-in safeguard to protect the child from experiencing severe emotional distress and to dull the physical sensation of pain. Dissociation serves as a kind of psychic anesthetic that allows the child to “escape” the horror of abuse. This happens most often when the abuse occurs repeatedly without intervention. The child learns that no one will step in and save them, so their brain steps in and disconnects their conscious from the horrible reality. It has been related to the mechanism of “playing dead”. Again, it is not a conscious decision – our body instinctively activates this mechanism to  dampen our pain (mental and physical) response that is activated during the abuse. \\n\\nIn a [publication that came out this month](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/09/16/913565163/scientists-discover-way-to-induce-altered-state-of-mind-without-drugs), researchers have shown us exactly what is happening in the brain when someone is dissociated. They did it with mice, using a dose of ketamine that was strong enough to induce dissociative effects. After measuring the mouse behavior and brain activation, the scientists then genetically altered cells of the mouse brain to respond to light (a process called optogenetics). The scientists were able to induce the same behavior as the ketamine by using these photosensitive brain cells to induce a similar brain cell “oscillation” as the drug.\\n\\nThe brain region at the center of dissociative mouse behavior is the posterior medial cortex. In humans, this part of the brain is thought to control functions such as visual-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval, self-processing and consciousness. It is part of the Default Mode Network (a pivotal area of research for scientists exploring the effects of psychedelics – more about that[ here](https://mindfulcatlady.com/2019/09/27/psychedelics-and-psychotherapy-a-magic-cure/)). Essentially, the part of the brain that is highly active during dissociation is the “I’m conscious but not really ‘here’” – the awake-but-resting part. Researchers also found that dissociation induced by ketamine shows reduced connections of this brain region to other brain regions. This may be what contributes to the unsettling symptoms of dissociation that sufferers experience – feelings of unreality, feelings of detachment, hallucinations, voices, etc. \\n\\nIn dissecting this new and exciting research, we have a deeper understanding of what happens in the brain when someone dissociates. This is a brave new step in the right direction of better treatment for those who are struggling with dissociation. Therapists working with those struggling with their dissociating will often help the person implement grounding skills – skills that orient us back into the “here and now”. The mindfulness movement is a mainstay in helping those with dissociation touch base with reality after being out of touch for much too long. Dissociation is an unconscious process that occurs when danger is felt – mindfulness teaches the body that our surroundings are safe and dissociation is politely dismissed from duty. It can be an arduous battle for the person with the dissociative disorder. And that is why this research is an exhilarating step onto a new frontier of treating a class of mental health that has been a mystery for too long.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642007888,\"title\":\"When You Give a Mouse a Drug\"},\"digest\":\"jouedLJjHcRYCaCckBoRTQU8S8Nx4kyv36X1ucHxNXY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd7babDc228de41E4a33B51A403A563Ab2a988DFC\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9ImArTthjfB60IA6univdmfzmIkeJabqFU0hSshcuZQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2A1-N8-Vo45uj71ov_iGt9HMmRU5D_1319_T0VGNRTY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Zo766elrjQkzzlGNNZh_cVA2r56eDHMousUCGl1FowPtyqz_NTr2cWY9OX3cRCKRnctsmzNOmyd9tGitphGbIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa7d0c7a5a30ca3049f25006e2605e846c3e211a7aa383012fda86caa80203d181edaac76f72f1c3d607c35cb51c6cf2a8eb208b661131a19f19b7a985d92dc191c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9ImArTthjfB60IA6univdmfzmIkeJabqFU0hSshcuZQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2A1-N8-Vo45uj71ov_iGt9HMmRU5D_1319_T0VGNRTY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jouedLJjHcRYCaCckBoRTQU8S8Nx4kyv36X1ucHxNXY\"}"
