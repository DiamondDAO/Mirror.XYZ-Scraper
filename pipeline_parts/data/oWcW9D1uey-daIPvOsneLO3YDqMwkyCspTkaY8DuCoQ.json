"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Will it comfort you to know that I have been very unhappy ever since you lowered yourself so? I will try and accept your explanation.\\\"\\n\\nHe clasped his hands with gratitude.\\n\\n\\\"Edward, will you grant me a favor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you ask?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is to have a little more confidence in one who-- Now you must obey me implicitly, and perhaps we may both be happier to-morrow night than we are to-night. Directly after breakfast take your hat and walk to Hillstoke. You can call on Miss Gale, if you like, and say something civil.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What! go and leave you alone with Lord Uxmoor?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, Zoe, you know your power. Have a little mercy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps I may have a great deal--if you obey me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I *will* obey you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then go to bed this minute.\\\"\\n\\nShe gave him a heavenly smile, and closed the window.\\n\\nNext morning, as soon as breakfast was over, Ned Severne said, \\\"Any messages for Hillstoke? I am going to walk up there this morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Embrace my virago for me,\\\" said Vizard.\\n\\nSeverne begged to be excused.\\n\\nHe hurried off, and Lord Uxmoor felt a certain relief.\\n\\nThe Master of Arts asked himself what he could do to propitiate the female M. D. He went to the gardener and got him to cut a huge bouquet, choice and fragrant, and he carried it all the way to Hillstoke. Miss Gale was at home. As he was introduced rather suddenly, she started and changed color, and said, sharply, \\\"What do you want?\\\" Never asked him to sit down, rude Thing!\\n\\nHe stood hanging his head like a culprit, and said, with well-feigned timidity, that he came, by desire of Miss Vizard, to inquire how she was getting on, and to hope the people were beginning to appreciate her.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! that alters the case; any messenger from Miss Vizard is welcome. Did she send me those flowers, too? They are beautiful.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. I gathered them myself. I have always understood ladies loved flowers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is only by report you know that, eh? Let me add something to your information: a good deal depends on the giver; and you may fling these out of the window.\\\" She tossed them to him.\\n\\nThe Master of Arts gave a humble, patient sigh, and threw the flowers out of the window, which was open. He then sunk into a chair and hid his face in his hands.\\n\\nMiss Gale colored, and bit her lip. She did not think he would have done that, and it vexed her economical soul. She cast a piercing glance at him, then resumed her studies, and ignored his presence.\\n\\nBut his patience exhausted hers. He sat there twenty minutes, at least, in a state of collapse that bid fair to last forever.\\n\\nSo presently she looked up and affected to start. \\\"What! are you there still?\\\" said she.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said be; \\\"you did not dismiss me; only my poor flowers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said she, apologetically, \\\"the truth is, I'm not strong enough to dismiss you by the same road.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is not necessary. You have only to say, 'Go.' \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, that would be rude. Could not you go without being told right out?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I could not. Miss Gale, I can't account for it, but there is some strange attraction. You hate me, and I fear you, yet I could follow you about like a dog. Let me sit here a little longer and see you work.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Gale leaned her head upon her hand, and contemplated him at great length. Finally she adopted a cat-like course. \\\"No,\\\" said she, at last; \\\"I am going my rounds: you can come with me, if I am so attractive.\\\"\\n\\nHe said he should be proud, and she put on her hat in thirty seconds.\\n\\nThey walked together in silence. He felt as if he were promenading a tiger cat, that might stop any moment to fall upon him.\\n\\nShe walked him into a cottage: there was a little dead wood burning on that portion of the brick floor called the hearth. A pale old man sat close to the fire, in a wooden armchair. She felt his pulse, and wrote him a prescription.\\n\\n\\\"To Mr. Vizard's housekeeper, Vizard Court:\\n\\n\\\"Please give the bearer two pounds of good roast beef or mutton, not salted, and one pint port wine,\\n\\n\\\"RHODA GALE, M. D.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here, Jenny,\\\" she said to a sharp little girl, the man's grandniece, \\\"take this down to Vizard Court, and if the housekeeper objects, go to the front-door and demand in my name to see the squire or Miss Vizard, and give *them* the paper. Don't you give it up without the meat. Take this basket on your arm.\\\"\\n\\nThen she walked out of the cottage, and Severne followed her: he ventured to say that was a novel prescription.\\n\\nShe explained. \\\"Physicians are obliged to send the rich to the chemist, or else the fools would think they were slighted. But we need not be so nice with the poor; we can prescribe to do them good. When you inflicted your company on me, I was sketching out a treatise, to be entitled, 'Cure of Disorders by Esculents.' That old man is nearly exsanguis. There is not a drug in creation that could do him an atom of good. Nourishing food may. If not, why, he is booked for the long journey. Well, he has had his innings. He is fourscore. Do you think *you* will ever see fourscore--you and your vices?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, no. But I think *you* will; and I hope so; for you go about doing good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And some people one could name go about doing mischief?\\\"\\n\\nSeverne made no reply.\\n\\nSoon after they discovered a little group, principally women and children. These were inspecting something on the ground, and chattering excitedly. The words of dire import, \\\"She have possessed him with a devil,\\\" struck their ear. But soon they caught sight of Miss Gale, and were dead silent. She said, \\\"What is the matter? Oh, I see, the vermifuge has acted.\\\"\\n\\nIt was so: a putty-faced boy had been unable to eat his breakfast; had suffered malaise for hours afterward, and at last had been seized with a sort of dry retching, and had restored to the world they so adorn a number of amphibia, which now wriggled in a heap, and no doubt bitterly regretted the reckless impatience with which they had fled from an unpleasant medicine to a cold-hearted world.\\n\\n\\\"Well, good people,\\\" said Miss Gale, what are you making a fuss about? Are they better in the boy or out of him?\\\"\\n\\nThe women could not find their candor at a moment's notice, but old Giles replied heartily, \\\"Why, hout! better an empty house than a bad tenant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is true,\\\" said half a dozen voices at once. They could resist common sense in its liquid form, but not when solidified into a proverb.\\n\\n\\\"Catch me the boy,\\\" said Miss Gale, severely.\\n\\nHabitual culpability destroys self-confidence; so the boy suspected himself of crime, and instantly took to flight. His companions loved hunting; so three swifter boys followed him with a cheerful yell, secured him, and brought him up for sentence.\\n\\n\\\"Don't be frightened, Jacob,\\\" said the doctress. \\\"I only want to know whether you feel better or worse.\\\"\\n\\nHis mother put in her word: \\\"He was ever so bad all the morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hold your jaw,\\\" said old Giles, \\\"and let the boy tell his own tale.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/25](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/25)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637670543,\"title\":\"You need not defy me.
