With these features, UniArts define itself with a simple word: Art-Fi,\\n\\n Art-Fi, is UniArts’ Innovative answering to Fine Art NFTs. With Art-Fi:\\n\\n UniArts allows community members with UARTs & wETHs to vote for any NFT artwork that they want on the platform. Voting benefits both the art lover and the artist because they are given new UART tokens during the process, and UART token also minted into NFT at the vote end with the amount of vote it received. Meanwhile，The person who wins the NFT auction can take out the UART and sell it. Therefore, in theory, the value of an NFT should not be lower than the value of the UART contained in it.\\n\\n At the same time, you can stake UART tokens to bid for a curator position, which allows you to move your NFT from other platforms (like OpenSea) to UniArts. While on UniArts, these moved NFTs can be displayed and voted, while UARTs will be minted into curator's (voted) NFTs.,\\n\\n Also, the NFT sold on UniArt’s “Impossible Art Formula Gallery” can be used as cards in the “ART-VERSUS” NFT Game, which will start around Q1 2022\\n\\n In a word, UniArts’ Art-Fi: Fine Arts with social, game and benefit\\n\\n**What are UniArts trying to do?**\\n\\n1. UniArts will encourage people to appreciate art and NFT through the income of UART.\\n2. It will provide basic value support for NFT by minting UART to NFT. The number of UARTs represents the consensus of the NFT in the UniArts network, allowing the users to find the fair value of the NFT.\\n3. NFTs with underlying value support will be used as collateral for lending platforms, improving the integration of NFTs into financial products.\\n4. By cooperating with more NFT game projects, the assets of other game projects will be used in the Play to Earn ecosystem in UniArts network. This will create a GameFi Lego similar to Defi Lego, which can also make art more interesting.\\n5. By allowing multiple projects to become curators, the UniArts network will aggregate many high-quality NFT projects. After the launch of the UniArts chain, it will gradually become the largest and strongest curatorial application chain. Users can interact with most high-quality NFT projects just on one chain.\\n6. It will cooperate with NFT projects to build a unique NFT first fair value issuance network. UniArts network will become a gold-plated platform for NFT, and an IDO platform for NFT-like assets, which offers more than an issue “assets-purchase” feature. It is offering value support for “vote- NFT”.\\n7. Lovers of NFTs in a Vault that are unable to buy an entire NFT in a short time can participate with UniArts. It will promote the interaction between creators and fans, and create a closer relationship through NFT Vault — social tokens.\\n\\n   **What are the advantages of your own projects? How do you stand out in the market competition?**\\n\\n   The core idea about UniArts’ ART-Fi is to bond and connect artwork NFTs with the community and apply social attributes.\\n\\n    We understand that collectable NFTs are valuable because they are backed by Community Consensus meanwhile Crypto Arts lacks this feature due to its “1-on-1” seller-buyer 2 point interaction. Once some purchased an NFT, these isn’t a proper “Crypto-native scenario” to show out one’s collection.\\n\\n    But with UniArt, every one can become a Curator and show out their collection in the best place of our gallery, and let the community to common and vote for these NFTs, and benefit from the appreciation of these NFTs. Both artistes and collectors can fans and follower with UniArts’ features.\\n\\n    Also, everyone who votes for NFTs, will receive a free souvenir NFT, with a smaller version of the metadata of the NFT they voted Embedded in.\\n\\n   **The economic model is very important to every project, and it is also the most concerned issue for investors. Could you please introduce the economic model of the project?**\\n\\n   In simple words, stake UARTs and vote for NFTs create more UARTs, stake more UARTs to bid for a curatorial position to exhibit one’s NFT collections to be voted.\\n\\n    The very nature of UART, is an abstractive unit of human favour for artworks NFTs in the network. (Just recall when a mobile APP or a song asks you to rate it between 1 to 5 stars, that 1 star is an abstractive unit of your favour in that system)\\n\\n    The process of voting by staking UART for a particular NFT for a particular NFT generates not only gallery traffic for that NFT, but also asset transfer from the UART owner’s wallet to the staking pool. Since the costs of UARTs are none-zero, and the process of staking/voting is recorded in the blockchain and trustless, UniArts recognizes the proven traffic-add value for the NFT vote. With the repeat of the staking-and-vote process from different people, the value of voted NFTs increases. \\n\\n    There are 100 million UARTs in total, about 60% UARTs will be mined from voting. 20% of UARTs that belong to early investors will be released during 5 quarters after TGE.

UniArts’ NFT gallery on polygon is online, voting and mining are started, marketing and PR to increase our user base.\\n      1\\\\.1 Start UniArts' DAO plan and introduce a large number of KOLs and ecological contributors\\n      1\\\\.2 Offer extra UARTs rewards for LP providers on Quick swap, the rewards will be provided in the galley DAPP and available to vote mining.\\n      1\\\\.3 Open NFT Mythic Box sales. NFT avatars sold on the platform can only be purchased with UART. NFT avatars are made from licensed IP.\\n   2. Expand the gallery to support UniArts mainnet and use the Polkadot cross-chain bridge to attract users to the uniarts mainnet.\\n      2\\\\.1 Launch UniArts multi-chain wallet, integrated gallery and NFT voting, supports assets from  polygon and UniArts and other networks\\n   3. Open the curator place bidding, token holders can pledge uart to obtain a curator seat, and curators can display their own NFT as a voting object, and the voted NFT will be cast into UART to increase value, thereby increasing NFT Of liquidity.\\n      3\\\\.1  Start with inviting other famous NFT projects to launch their new NFT with UniArts voting & Auction.\\n\\n   **Many blockchain projects are not solving any real problem, they just exist to sell their tokens. What problems exactly is your projects solving, and solutions are you provide?**\\n\\n   We found an important lack of NFT at present, that is, the application of NFT in the financial field is still not enough, we let the users in the UniArts network vote for NFT through a bottom-up approach, and NFT will be cast into the new incremental UART according to the number of votes it gets, then the number of UARTs constitutes the basic financial value of NFT.\\n\\n   **What is the current development focus of the project? Is there any progress in the near future? What are your plans for the future?**\\n\\n   The three grants we have received so far：Web3 Foundation Grants：UniScan NFT Explorer; - SR25519 (Ruby Substate Client); Polygon Grants：The Impossible Art Fromula Gallery; will support UniArts mainnet as well as other established networks; We currently have an estimated 70,000 users on all of our social platforms including Twitter, Telegram, and Instagram, and we have planned many marketing campaigns and mutual diversions with various partners, and many users have already started using our gallery after its launch.\\n\\n   Uniscan, which is a NFT explorer developed by UniArts and granted by Web 3, will show the new & popular NFTs across multiple networks, currently in milestone 2. It may serve as a traffic entrance for NFTs, and UniArts may utilize it and direct more users to its gallery and ecosystem. Our NFT Game “ART-VERSUS” make Serious Art Interesting.Game launch Q1 2022, support all NFT purchased in AF Gallery as cards,Please look forward to it!\\n\\n   **Are there any new marketing activities for UniArts recently?**\\n\\n   We are pleased to announce that UniArts Network and KAKA NFT World have formed a strategic partnership. UniArts will release 6 new special Christmas models for KAKA NFT World on Christmas Eve, December 24, 2021 in the Impossible Art Formula gallery as part of KAKA Rabbit’s fair value discovery and issuance services.\\n\\n   KAKA NFT World will release 6 different KAKA Rabbits in UniArts’ NFT gallery, The Impossible Art Formula, to discover their market value. The whole process is divided into a voting round and an auction round.\\n\\n   Firstly, UniArts users who hold UART or WETH can vote for their favorite KAKA Rabbit through staking, in which they receive UART according to the duration and quantity of staking.\\n\\n   Second, KAKA Rabbit will be continuously cast into the corresponding number of UARTs according to the degree of community users’ love. KAKA Rabbit represents the recognition of the community users through the number of UARTs it has mint into it, and these UARTs will make up its base layer. As a result of value support, KAKA Rabbit will become collateral on UniArts’ future lending platform.\\n\\n   Finally, if the user’s favorite KAKA Rabbit is auctioned and sold after the voting round, the user will get more UART revenue that is proportional to the KAKA Rabbit auction transaction price.By actively appreciating KAKA Rabbit NFTs, users have earned income along the way. The principle is “Appreciate to Earn” — a fundamental economic principle of UniArts. To learn more about “Appreciate to Earn”, please refer to the following article:\\n\\n   https://www.coinspeaker.com/uniart-impossible-art-formula-gallery-nft-appreciation-vote-mining/\\n\\n   Last but not least, our Meta  Gallery（ https://www.cryptovoxels.com/play?coords=N@895E,158S,8U）will be inaugurated on Christmas Day, December 25, when we will join forces with several high-traffic project parties to participate. Users can open a photo at an officially designated location and post it on social media, then submit relevant information to the official UniArts release information collection form to be rewarded with an airdrop from UART, please stay tuned for more details on our official Twitter, thanks for your support.\\n\\n    We will be hosting our token listing event on Pancake and Quickswap on December 26th at 12PM UTC time! The team at UniArts Network is very excited for you to join the major milestone and witness the beginning of a great journey as $UART token holders.\\n\\n    Website : https://uniarts.network/\\n\\n   Gallery: https://af.uniarts.network/\\n\\n   UART Vote Tutorial : https://uniartsnetwork.medium.com/tutorial-claim-airdrop-rewards-use-them-to-vote-for-nfts-fbaa0847a960\\n\\n   WETH Vote Tutorial : https://uniartsnetwork.medium.com/tutorial-using-weth-to-cast-votes-on-uniarts-and-earn-uart-5819d93fef5a\\n\\n   Twitter : https://twitter.com/UniartsNetwork\\n\\n   Medium : https://uniartsnetwork.medium.com/\\n\\n   Discord : https://discord.com/invite/ujZeGvX\\n\\n   Github：https://github.com/uni-arts-chain/\\n\\n   Dapp Demo：https://app.uniarts.network/\\n\\n   Explorer：https://uniarts.subscan.io/\\n\\n   Telegram : https://t.me/uniarts\\n\\n   Telegram News : https://t.me/uniartsnews\\n\\n   Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/uniarts_network/\\n\\n    `Risk warning: All articles at seven o'clock cannot be used as investment advice or recommendations.
