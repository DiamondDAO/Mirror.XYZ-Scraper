"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I lived near the Mediterranean sea and often I can go on Sunday or in late evening.\\n\\nThat day my friends proposed me to come to the beach it was very hot day and I was a little bit tired.\\n\\nWe arrived at the beach, it wasn't too full of people so it was great we could swim easily.\\n\\n## Stupid Idea\\n\\nI was with friends but actually it was friends of my ex-girlfriend and she was there.\\n\\nOne of her friends is in the army, he is a soldier, highly trained.\\n\\nAnd he challenged me to go to swim to the limit of allowed, we can see it with a yellow markup.\\n\\nBoat can't go before these markups, it's 300 meters from the beach.\\n\\nYou have different markup at the beach (in France) that shows where swimming is watched by lifeguard, where boat can come back (swimming there isn't allowed) and the 300m limit where swimming isn't watched but boat aren't allowed also (fast boats)\\n\\nI didn't know before it was this far, it looked like it wasn't so far.\\n\\nWhen you looked from the coast it looked almost close and easy to do.\\n\\n## Man complex\\n\\nChallenge accepted.\\n\\nI had nothing to prove but I was stupid, ex-girlfriend was there, he challenged me, I accepted.\\n\\nI would have felt bad if I refused, being devalued, it would be a shame.\\n\\nBecause even if people wouldn't tell, which isn't always the case, sometimes they don't care and tells you that you are a wimp..\\n\\nEven if they wouldn't tell, you can feel the thoughts, you can feel the pressure, unbearable pressure when you have a bit of ego and self-esteem. Today I don't feel the, I like to get out of my comfort zone, to do things I wouldn't but I can also know what I'm really capable of and I will not do stupid things like this without being trained to, and maybe even if I feel trained enough you will see later in the text.\\n\\nI don't really understand why still today it's all like that, I don't think people realize pressure they put on the people around. I agree that a lot of people put a lot of pressure on themselves, but there is a reason to it.\\n\\nSometimes I do things I don't really like or want just not to appear unmanly. Not to cry, to be always strong, to fight or whatever. I find all of this so stupid but I would be ready to do it just not be \\\"a wimp\\\". Just because I still care too much about what people thinks of me today, well only few people. That's what changed.\\n\\nBefore I really thought important what people could think about me and I could do stupid thing to appear great. Today I mostly don't care, but there is still some people that I don't care at all what they thinks about me.\\n\\nThe problem is that sometimes they care about what other people will think about you and they project it to you. I don't know if you get it.\\n\\nI try not to care, but it's difficult with some people, and they have a lot of influence and power on me, without knowing.\\n\\nI care more about what people could think about my work, anonymously or not, I prefer (today) to stay the most I can anonymous because it transform everything.\\n\\nPeople will not think the same thing about a piece of work when they know who is behind.\\n\\nLook at art, I'm sorry to say and it is very personal but some artwork are not great, even bad, but when you know who did it, it get a lot of value.\\n\\nAnd with this, it's not your work anymore but you that is judged and it doesn't help to get rid of what people thinks of you.\\n\\nI'll write probably more about it and reread it because I just wrote without thinking too much but now I'm too lazy.\\n\\n## The moment\\n\\nAlright, let's talk about what's is next now that I accepted the challenge.\\n\\nIt would be even worse to go back.\\n\\nI remember walking through the beach just watching my objective, this yellow markup, next to my friend.\\n\\nHere we can go far enough walking in the sea, no need to swim at first we had to save stamina.\\n\\nThe water is coming up slowly from your feet to your neck, every step more.\\n\\nIt become harder to walk when your whole legs are under water, than your top, and when it reached your neck you have to start swimming.\\n\\nOut of the 300 meters we had to swim (well 600 meters to come back) it was maybe 30 to 40 meters of it, not bad.\\n\\nArrived to this point where we have no other choice, we started to swim, aiming the yellow markup.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes you feel the water becoming colder and colder, you can't see anything under you, it's completely dark, it feels so deep.\\n\\nAnd you don't know what is going on under you it's total unknown, but I wasn't thinking about this at this moment, fortunately.\\n\\nI only had my goal in head, reaching this yellow markup.\\n\\nWithout a doubt my military friend started to get some distance with me, because sometimes I took some rest, to breath and look around me, to stay in the good direction.\\n\\nAt some point, with the waves, and the eyes at the level of the sea, you don't see anything anymore. No yellow markup, no beach, only the buildings behind.\\n\\nSo you start to struggle to keep the good direction, well you know that it is at the opposite of the buildings, but you don't see exactly where is the yellow boey.\\n\\nThe sun is hitting hard, the water is cold, but I forgot to tell : I haven't eaten anything before coming.\\n\\nI can barely see my friend coming back, he already reached the markup and he is now aiming to the beach. Lucky.\\n\\nI can now see the markup and it looks like it is now very close, I'm very tired and completely alone.\\n\\nI can look right, nothing but water, left nothing but water, in front of my water with a yellow boey, and behind, water again.\\n\\nI've never experienced this before, no escape, water all around you, deep water.\\n\\nIt was during my panic attacks period of life that I discuss in this text \\\\[link\\\\]. Fortunately the attack happened only the night for me, I wouldn't be here if I had an attack alone in the water.\\n\\nI finally reached the markup I stay there few minutes try to grad the boey, but it's not a little boey and it is hard to catch. It wasn't very usefull.\\n\\nAt this moment I had 300 meters of water all around me minimum.\\n\\nAnd only one way to go to reach the coast.\\n\\nI wasn't feeling right starting to have one thought : Will I make it the other way ?\\n\\nBecause when you aren't trained, 300 meters in the sea with the sun and the waves, etc. It's doable.\\n\\nBut you should think about the way back before starting.\\n\\nI decided to start swimming to get back to earth.\\n\\nI didn't know how it would go.\\n\\n## Survival instinct\\n\\nLet's go back.\\n\\nOne arm after the other in one direction, it shouldn't be so complicated.\\n\\nBut when your arms start to become heavier and heavier, everything seems more difficult.\\n\\nSo every 30 seconds I had to take a break and did the plank trying to let the waves to help me.\\n\\nEvery big waves I started to swim again has fast as possible to take advantage of it.\\n\\nI wasn't making a lot of progress, but the worst is, I wasn't seeing any progress at all, I couldn't see the sand, no people, no beach.\\n\\nI started to feel dizzy, I just wanted to put my feet somewhere and to not have to make any effort to stay up.\\n\\nI even had some difficulties holding the plank at this point.\\n\\nBreathing became the most important thing in my life, because at this moment I was completely aware of how important breathing is.\\n\\n10 minutes trying to get back to the coast passed, and it has been a total of more than 30 minutes I was not on the ground anymore.\\n\\nAnd for the first time of my life I drawned, or just had the feeling of it. I was struggling to keep my head out of the water and often my head was under, I couldn't breath properly.\\n\\nI had to calm and stop panicking, but I was exhausted, I wanted to take a real break, just lie down and sleep or I don't know but I needed to feel safe.\\n\\nAnd it was at this critical moment, when I was starting to think I was going to die like this, so stupid, I remembered the dike.\\n\\nThe dike it is like sea wall, rocks that goes \\\"far\\\" from the coast into the sea to protect the coast from storms...\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/D68Q2wmC5jFJhFJ1XTzPY.png?height=576&width=1024)\\n\\nWell it's not going so far but it is less length to swim.\\n\\nHaving this in mind gave me a lot of hope because I saw a way to escape.\\n\\nAnd suddenly I found some deep strength I don't really know where it came from but I could start swimming again.\\n\\nI was still aiming the coast but I was looking for these rocks.\\n\\nAnd I could see them appears in my vision, I was finally safe, I just had to swim to the rock.\\n\\nBut it was so far it has been almost 1 hours I'm in the water, swimming.\\n\\nI used the same strategy than before, plank to rest, fast crawl at every waves.\\n\\nI finaly arrived to the rocks, and I beached on the rocks like a whale, I grabbed as I could the rocks and didn't move for few minutes.\\n\\nThe ground, gravity, feeling this weight was so great, it makes me wonder how they do at the ISS.\\n\\nI took my time to breath, and after 5 to 10 minutes I get up and walked back to the beach walking on the rocks. I was focusing not to fall or to faint.\\n\\nI was feeling very bad while walking, I finally reached the beach and walked to my friends.\\n\\nOnce I reached them, I falled, they were very worried because I disappear more than an hour they couldn't see my in the water. They first thought I was doing an insolation and they put me under a sun umbrella. But I was still very bad, so we thought maybe it's hypothermia with the cold of the sea. It wasn't. Then my friends went to ask to the houses just at the level of the beach for food, sugar.\\n\\nAfter some sugar I was becoming better. I did hypoglycemia.\\n\\nNever again, I now try to swim in parallel to the beach and always where I can put my foot on the ground.\\n\\nI will rewrite it because I wrote everything always very tired\",\"timestamp\":1639610371,\"title\":\"🌊 The time I almost drowned\"},\"digest\":\"gDpfgYyNaIRWmXK-uDvFzt_lOSvp0W-4kX2yFWYRMWs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x26f755132D69dA9e2C2B27cF80e65aE0fa79Bf15\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nySNejJpBLLWXa5QVrJpO-EfxlG7kEWmK1EORRnXyHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wgMc0ZwVJRDzdEvlguhBNYau7bKtCQBmZ8I8SjnAutk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"V4vEqpvaVIKPab5TuU_K32bBc_V4rLIt4414NYpk_1VhNfls4X5OAcAyuM2cTtxc0LWgGrYnQqXdU2TFs_Zy8w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe367b4d52bcb1c224a1779bac8b613b6445fb115f6b8ea8404555f153d78c64762e67fba92b0357bd67f2d680861b3971f4ba94e3f07c14b45f88e61a8ab8e6e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nySNejJpBLLWXa5QVrJpO-EfxlG7kEWmK1EORRnXyHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wgMc0ZwVJRDzdEvlguhBNYau7bKtCQBmZ8I8SjnAutk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gDpfgYyNaIRWmXK-uDvFzt_lOSvp0W-4kX2yFWYRMWs\"}"
