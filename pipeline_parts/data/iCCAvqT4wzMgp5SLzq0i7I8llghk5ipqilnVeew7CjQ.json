"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![StarSharks](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/hiHct6R5IOzwKZyDrT-7k.png?height=366&width=673)\\n\\nStarSharks is an NFT-GameFi ocean metaverse game strategically invested by Binance Lab. The team members come from Timi Studio, Google and Binance, and are currently in the BETA testing phase.\\n\\nOn November 2nd, I was fortunate enough to get the first official test quota at the StarSharks official discord.\\n\\nThe next night, I received a test email from the StarSharks team, and I was very excited. Open the email immediately and test it according to the content of the email.\\n\\nLet me talk about this game for everyone.\\n\\n### Install\\n\\nOpen the test website. Due to the current test stage, you need to authorize the test username and password to access it.\\n\\nClick Download menu  to download the mobile APP (currently only the Android APK file is released), and then transfer it to the mobile phone for installation.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KFUZgbzgVdGcS89-LSJEU.png?height=388&width=3290)\\n\\n### Connect wallet\\n\\nStarSharks is built on the BSC network, the BSC test network used for testing, first add the BSC test network to Metamask,\\n\\nIn the test email, each tester was assigned a test wallet address and private key, import the private key  into Metamask.\\n\\nClick Connect button in the upper right corner, and Metamask pops up to select the test address to confirm.\\n\\n![Connect wallet](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MD5PVqYkqWnvsZyZPZWHe.png?height=1262&width=1196)\\n\\nThen metamask pops up to request a signature\\n\\n![Sign](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/B1l3RZYfzo49HvFnPNEmb.png?height=1238&width=720)\\n\\nAfter signing, the user address appears in the upper right corner, click on the address pop-up menu, there is a User center link, a game login QR code, use this QR code to log in to the mobile APP\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_aBVdXCu1IA36cl1aufi4.png?height=1162&width=778)\\n\\nClick the \\\"user center\\\" link to enter the user center\\n\\nUser center shows BNB balance, SEA reward and SSS balance\\n\\nStarSharks is a dual-token mechanism, SEA is used for in-game purchases (such as shark upgrades, shark rentals), and SSS is a governance token.\\n\\nThe official gave three sharks for testing, and there was a bit of BNB in the wallet to buy sharks.\\n\\n![wallet page](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/URucyOCadNNAKjsx8iK-l.png?height=1598&width=2646)\\n\\nThis page also has a shark upgrade function. Choosing two sharks with the same star rating can give birth to a shark with more stars. but there is also a certain risk of failure.\\n\\nAfter the upgrade, the two parent sharks will be destroyed, and a higher-level shark with a new gene will be generated based on the parent gene (similar to the breeding of CryptoKitties).\\n\\n![Upgrade](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/o7225I06zho9m1UALwHE-.png?height=935&width=1522)\\n\\nThere is also an Activity tab below, which records some operation records, such as shark rental, purchase and other logs.\\n\\n![Activity](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fF4umZ3b7CGovJCwHnEdS.png?height=1612&width=1922)\\n\\nAt the bottom is the credit record.\\n\\nThe credit score is capped at 200 points and will be increased by 10 points for each successful rental. If each rental does not meet the expectations set by the lessor, the credit score will be deducted. Credit points will be deducted. When the score is reduced to zero for the first time, the rental will be banned for one day, and then banned if the score is reduced to zero again. If the score is reduced to 0 again, the lease is banned for 5 days, and so on (1 day, 5 days, 9 days, 13 days ......). At the end of the ban period, the credit score returns to 100. The credit score returns to 100 points.\\n\\n![Credit record](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/A380uxkOUnUjeR96Z9Oyj.png?height=1540&width=2682)\\n\\nMarketPlace is a shark market where you can buy and rent sharks, buy sharks using BNB, and rent sharks using game token SEA.

Each time the PVP arena uses 1 point of energy, there will be different energy values and energy recovery times according to the total stars of sharks you have, as shown in the figure:\\n\\n![Energy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LGB7DhIqyV3cyVI3-gCSS.png?height=1080&width=2400)\\n\\nThe three icons in the lower left corner are Shark, team and tasks\\n\\n**Shark** - Manage your shark, Sync Shark synchronizes the shark (when the shark changes, click the sync button to synchronize), you can view the shark genus, skills and shark skin.\\n\\n![My shark](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T_atAvA2CW0sEyyNq1FgJ.png?height=1080&width=2400)\\n\\n**Team** - Create and edit your team. At least one team is required to play the game.\\n\\nYou must have three sharks to create a team. There are four positions to place your sharks. It is recommended to play a tank shark  in the front, and damage and heal at the back.\\n\\n![Team](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jz-mc8d80ccpzWbe8u98-.png?height=1080&width=2400)\\n\\n**Daily quest** - have three tasks daily\\n\\n1\\\\.

There are currently two game modes, one is PVE adventure and the other is PVP arena.\\n\\nThe bottom right corner is the leaderboard and settings menu\\n\\n**Adventure Model**\\n\\nAdventure mode is PVE mode, there are many levels, each level is getting harder and harder.\\n\\n![Adventure model](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OJwldJ57tZ5IPRJtEPLkq.png?height=1080&width=2400)\\n\\n**Arena Model**\\n\\nArena mode is the PVP mode, the game automatically matches the right players for battle.\\n\\n### Gameplay\\n\\nThe game uses a turn-based + card game. At the beginning of each round, each shark will randomly deal cards. The amethyst on the left is the number of points that can be played, similar to Hearthstone. The cards must be played within the specified time. You can also click the yellow button “End turn” on the right to start the round.\\n\\nCards are the skills of each shark. There are various skills, damage, defense, restore HP and so on.\\n\\nIf the match is won, the points will be increased, and if the match is lost, the points will be reduced.\\n\\n![Arena model](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Ct1Y26BsuR55PnwnrBHX.png?height=1080&width=2400)\\n\\n### Leaderboard\\n\\nIn the season leaderboard, those who are on the list will be rewarded. This is the way to play to earn.\\n\\n![Leaderboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LSQS8OqNChRHivSd4e9dE.png?height=1080&width=2400)\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIn general, although the game has some little bugs, it is still relatively complete. It is estimated that it will be launched soon. I still don't know how to distribute the Genesis Shark NFT. I guess it may be a whitelist + public sale .\\n\\nThe StarShark game is similar to Axie's mode, but has his own innovations. It uniquely uses a turn-based + skill card mode to make the game more fun. It is not only on-hook mode, but also requires operational skills.\\n\\nHope that StarShark will have more game modes in the future.\\n\\n**Learn more about StarSharks:**\\n\\nTwitter:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/StarSharks_SSS](https://twitter.com/StarSharks_SSS)\\n\\nMedium:\\n\\n[https://medium.com/@StarSharks](https://medium.com/@StarSharks)\\n\\nBinance invests in StarShark news：\\n\\n[https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684902988/ecosystem/binance-labs-makes-strategic-investment-in-star-sharks-to-grow-the-bsc-ecosystem?utm_campaign=web_share_link&utm_source=twitter](https://www.binance.com/en/blog/421499824684902988/ecosystem/binance-labs-makes-strategic-investment-in-star-sharks-to-grow-the-bsc-ecosystem?utm_campaign=web_share_link&utm_source=twitter)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636599144,\"title\":\"StarSharks BETA test round 1\"},\"digest\":\"PZxX6ur2f9EBg5JARv8u2QMQsEEppUcGMrXiUBPQJCE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x635b2aA4b3A3eAca4F84f5b3eaf49f10C7B9A914\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7-kE_S3Ue3zFtxpM7DjUgKc2Kt2bX7Ld8DoBXkl-jCw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xC9M8cVXJ73o5DHFndHwr_f-TsS6Oe95RezFlpYG100\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"njyDZDkB47Smi7SRKdavl3gcakZMBWMayB41hJXaQ7ppjAG7UgsTsytrews-bUDbQhVkQdEWYoP5FUwYUCDkiA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x01b2830a8bf0203dd24b1b16d0537542ec64a011368443ec15458ee2225c71f1743800d5925d774e5ece7e490324936b0c071de8c4f84815ac4f8579b175b4231c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7-kE_S3Ue3zFtxpM7DjUgKc2Kt2bX7Ld8DoBXkl-jCw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xC9M8cVXJ73o5DHFndHwr_f-TsS6Oe95RezFlpYG100\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"X8d1jOzYXYeO7Zmz0rO0UNCy1PROEcWVF3R3FDzf6UI\"}"
