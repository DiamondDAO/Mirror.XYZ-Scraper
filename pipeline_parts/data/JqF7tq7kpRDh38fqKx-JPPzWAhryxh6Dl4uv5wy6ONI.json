"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***Note:*** *While this post is for collectors of my work, I’m publishing it here as a framework that any artist transitioning into NFTs could use to help bring their fans to the space. Copy as much of this post as you’d like.*\\n\\n![A still from the first Limited Edition TEKSTartist NFT.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/cx4vicYjK5wzGJBDc-mQf.png?height=756&width=762)\\n\\nHi, I’m [Jaason.eth](https://foundation.app/@jaason), creator of [TEKSTartist](http://TEKSTartist.com). Over the last 10 years I’ve been lucky enough to sell art to thousands of collectors all over the world. If you’re one of them I hope you see this. **Today, I’m announcing my first two NFTs- a 1 of 1 original NFT, and a limited edition NFT.** *Even if you’re new to NFTs, or have never even heard of them… this is a really big deal and I hope you’ll read on.*\\n\\n## THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT:  If you’ve ever purchased art from me, you can claim one of the upcoming Limited Edition NFTs for FREE.\\n\\nOk, let’s back up a moment….\\n\\n### NFT’s?\\n\\nNFTs are a new type of digital good, in this case- collectible digital art. They can be  anything digital (images, music, collectibles, [and more](https://www.anothercrypto.show/episodes/getting-started-with-nfts)) and are created in a way that can’t be replicated.\\n\\n### What is this “Airdrop” and why would I want to claim it?\\n\\nThis airdrop is a distribution of NFTs to early TEKSTartist supporters. Anyone who purchased original work, prints, stickers, books, even murals at any point between November 9, 2011 and November 9, 2021 is eligible for the Airdrop. **Simply** **[fill out this form](https://forms.gle/FXnNE3h34azJ1iBL9) to be added to the claim list**.\\n\\nThree reasons this airdrop is happening:\\n\\n1. **This Airdrop is a giant THANK YOU.**\\n   While not a physical object, this NFT is a digital object that you can display, sell, trade, or even sell on secondary markets. It is a way to give a little something back to everyone who helped TEKSTartist get to where it is today.\\n2. **This Airdrop is an incentive for you to jump into this new space.**\\n   I was captivated by this space once I really dove in, and want to use what platform I have to bring YOU here too (whether you’re a collector or creator.)  I genuinely believe the future of the art industry, the music industry, and countless others will be changed by NFTs.\\n\\n   But perhaps most importantly…\\n3. **The TEKSTartist NFT is also a membership token. \\n **I’m not yet able to share everything we have planned, but I can say my goal is to make the Limited Edition NFT far more valuable to hold on to, than it will ever be for you to sell.\\n\\n## SO WHAT’S NEXT?\\n\\nAs mentioned at the top of this post, there are actually TWO different NFT projects launching today:\\n\\n**THE LIMITED EDITION WORK** *(The Airdrop piece for eligible collectors)*\\n\\nThink you might be eligible? **[Take a minute and fill out this form]()** with as much info as you can. We will reach out to you with the next steps. You can preview a still of the piece up above, but the complete piece will be revealed next week.\\n\\n**THE ORIGINAL WORK**\\n\\nThe 1 of 1 original work is up for auction starting today. You can preview the piece below (Direct link is [here](https://foundation.app/@jaason).) If you’ve got some ETH burning a hole in your pocket you can [place a bid on Foundation](https://foundation.app/@jaason/\\\\~/112671). Once a bid is placed a 24 hour auction will begin.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/112671](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/112671)\\n\\nSo excited to share more!
