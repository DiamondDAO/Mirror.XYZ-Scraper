The negotiations resuming this week are the first since Ebrahim Raisi became Iran's president in August.\\n\\nThe Raisi administration, which is generally regarded as holding a tough attitude toward the US, \\\"is unlikely to achieve a clear breakthrough\\\" with the US in its first nuclear talks, Niu said.\\n\\nNiu also noted the resistance toward a deal in Vienna among some quarters in Iran and the US.\\n\\n\\\"The outcome of this round of nuclear talks will, to a large extent, evolve into a clearer statement and description of their respective positions between the Joe Biden administration of the US and the Raisi administration of Iran.\\\"\\n\\nChina, one of the strongest advocates of the talks, will \\\"urge the US and Iran to resolve differences through negotiations and effectively manage conflicts\\\" while supporting Iran to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests, Niu said.\",\"timestamp\":1638457407,\"title\":\"Tough lines highlight challenges in Vienna\"},\"digest\":\"iT7j6c6eodH29nfnCdRRKj0KeGz0dfaPh35j70vq5Wg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5E62D5927d7A359Eca4e8feF15005C0FA818C07E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dLDOLHHXtD_6_0r4P4qkektvvFxBi2Lr0MuJp7IEM_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Gz8JmooNpxNVKZFrf2Y1EOVpqMkpsI6Uy5EyOYxyyf0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0R2eICYZ0myB9HSCZLxC8bPmdO9UEdm3nIylf82O0UW5Tnhb8GtZl45jit2ZMeQgMqvbDP5NIjZ7LMWI-yDkiA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x03cd159331963e20e2c122599106acf8e6330654e4483f7969cfccf80cef76a47d5f901ac19ed4a048defef9c480f9449467a1de69f85d6e61c742862c0eaf001b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"dLDOLHHXtD_6_0r4P4qkektvvFxBi2Lr0MuJp7IEM_E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Gz8JmooNpxNVKZFrf2Y1EOVpqMkpsI6Uy5EyOYxyyf0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iT7j6c6eodH29nfnCdRRKj0KeGz0dfaPh35j70vq5Wg\"}"
