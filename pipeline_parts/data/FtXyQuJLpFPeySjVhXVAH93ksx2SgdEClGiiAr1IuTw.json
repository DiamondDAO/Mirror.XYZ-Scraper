"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"***As I have started to invest in crypto, I have been learning quite a bit about different projects in the crypto space, blockchain technology and decentralized finance. In an effort to organize my thoughts, I have decided to start posting about what I learn. Hopefully, my posts can help others become more familiar with the space as well! \\n  \\n My first post is a general overview of some of the ways decentralized finance could improve our current financial systems which frankly, are built on old and often inefficient foundations. DeFi leverages the power of cryptography, decentralization, and blockchain to build a new system for payment, borrowing, lending, and trading.***\\n\\n1. In traditional financial systems settlements of stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments take days to clear and require massive amounts of human capital and international banking is even more inefficient and expensive\\n   1. ***DeFi systems are much more efficient and less expensive! Operations are settled almost instantly regardless of the locations of both parties and with minimal to no human involvement. Less human involvement = Fewer fees***\\n2. Lending and borrowing in traditional finance is complex, banks have to perform extensive diligence and a human being, or a group of human beings, ultimately approves or disapproves one’s loans\\n   1. ***In DeFi, lending and borrowing is programmable! By utilizing the blockchain and smart contracts, anyone can borrow an asset instantly by programmatically using another asset as collateral***\\n3. Billions of people around the world are unbanked, meaning they don’t belong to insured financial institutions that can help set up savings accounts, facilitate transactions, or build emergency funds.\\n   1. ***DeFi is a permissionless system. Everyone with an internet connection has access. Things like nationality, race, and gender do not matter, making it a more inclusive and accessible system.***\\n4. Large financial institutions can anonymously do whatever they want with the funds of their account holders, and as we have seen in the past, improper use of customer funds can lead to economic collapse\\n   1. ***In DeFi, transactions on the blockchain are transparent and therefore, established financial institutions are incentivized to act ethically and less likely to take advantage of the naïve account holder***\",\"timestamp\":1638646414,\"title\":\"4 Problems in Traditional Finance Solved by DeFi\"},\"digest\":\"rTenZ1g46V0BMshqMKQqcYtDXqYpnxNbETB0bXyhT_8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2776aAb4eF17904C4c96a9Fd4ba9F790cd1f0bd1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"79jGcRyS_xxQTok6vQANSXmOkKqNSvklYk_lc2vErfw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QzDzXUXEa04CAOesVX6p6nd620DvVzu1z0p_8GcLMWM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8pKdqjuI8Uknqh1QxgJGqCyisLpZNOAHuGmm1Mi5s5SZhWc_CssyaeJXNamlWOkh_N9Q8ggRyZz3Gg2HCIR9ZA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4946876e88166bcd8063dcfd6470c7d1794a2bf08dcb12c3fc3fdd639adc811e3bd34bc482f0bfb8e04045c27f405f971b5664279f37dd38892e8a59e1084c871b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"79jGcRyS_xxQTok6vQANSXmOkKqNSvklYk_lc2vErfw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"QzDzXUXEa04CAOesVX6p6nd620DvVzu1z0p_8GcLMWM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rTenZ1g46V0BMshqMKQqcYtDXqYpnxNbETB0bXyhT_8\"}"
