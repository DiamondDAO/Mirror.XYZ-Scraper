"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"an officer of the highest talent and energy, who brought everything under his control to the highest pitch of excellence.  I must also add a most important person, my old and much esteemed friend John Anderson, then general director of the Machinery of the arsenal.  He was an admirable mechanic, a man of clear practical good sense and judgment, and he eventually raised himself to the highest position in the public service.\\n\\nThe satisfactory performance of the machinery which had been supplied to the workshops of the royal dock yards and arsenals, led to further demands for similar machinery for foreign Governments.  Foreign visitor were allowed freely to inspect all that had been done whatever may be said of the wisdom of this proceeding it is certainly true that no mechanical improvement can long be kept secret nowadays. Everything is published and illustrated in our engineering journals. And if the foreigners had not been allowed to obtain their new machines from England, they were provided with facilities enough for constructing them for themselves.  At all events, one result of the improved working of the new machines at the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, was the receipt of large orders for our firm for the supply of foreign Governments. For instance, that of Spain employed us liberally, principally tor the equipment of the royal dockyards of Ferrol and Cartagena. These orders came to us through Messrs. Zuluatta Brothers, who conducted their proceedings with us in a prompt and business-like way for many years.  Through the same firm we obtained orders to furnish machinery for the Spanish royal dockyard at Havana.\\n\\nIn 1849 we received an extensive order from the Russian Government. This was transmitted to us through the Imperial Consulate in London. The machinery was required for the equipment of a very extensive rope factory at the naval arsenal of Nicolaiev, on the Black Sea This order included all the machinery requisite for the factory, from the heckling of the hemp to the twisting of the largest ropes and cables required in the Russian naval service.  The design and organisation of this machinery in its minutest detail caused me to made a special study of the art of rope-making.  It was a comparatively new subject to me; but I found it full of interest.  It was difficulty, and therefore to be overcome. And in this lies a great deal of the pleasure of contriving and inventing.\\n\\nDuring the progress of the work I had the advantage of the frequent presence of an able Russian officer, Captain Putchkraskey, whose intelligent supervision was a source of much satisfaction. We had also occasional visits from Admiral Kornileff, a man of the highest order of intelligence.  He was not only able to appreciate our exertions to execute the order in first-rate style, but to enter into all the special details and contrivances of the work while in progress. I had often occasion to meet Russian officers while at the Bridgewater Foundry.  They were usually men of much ability, selected by the Russian Government to act as their agents abroad, in order to keep them well posted up in all that had a bearing upon their own interests. They certainly reflected the highest credit on their Government, as proving their careful selection of the best men to advance the interests of Russia.\\n\\nDuring the visit of the Grand Duke Constantine to England about that time, he resided for some days with the Earl of Ellesmere at Worsley Hall, about a mile and a half from Bridgewater Foundry. We were favoured with several visits from the Grand Duke, accompanied by Baron Brunnow, Admiral Hoyden, and several other Russian officials. They came by Lord Ellesmere's beautiful barge, which drew up alongside our wharf, where the party landed and entered the works. The Grand Duke carefully inspected the whole place, and expressed himself as greatly pleased with the complete mastery which man had obtained over obdurate materials, through the unfailing agency of mechanical substitutes for manual dexterity and muscular force.\\n\\nI was invited to meet this distinguished party at Worsley Hall on more than one occasion, and was much pleased with the frank and intelligent conversation of the Grand Duke, in his reference to what he had seen in his visits to our works.  It was always a source of high pleasure to me to receive visits from Lord Ellesmere, as he was generally accompanied by men of distinction who were well able to appreciate the importance of what had been displayed before them.  The visits, for instance, of Rajah Brooke, the Earl of Elgin, the Duke of Argyll, Chevalier Bunsen, and Count Flahault, stand out bright in my memory.\\n\\nBut to return to my rope-making machinery.  It was finished to the satisfaction of the Russian officers.  It was sent off by ship to the Black Sea in July 1851, and fitted up at Nicolaiev shortly after. I received a kind and pressing invitation from Admiral Kornileff to accompany him on the first trip of a magnificent steamer which had been constructed in England under his supervision.  His object was, not only that I might have a pleasant voyage in his company, but that I might see my machinery in full action at Nicolaiev, and also that I might make a personal survey of the arsenal workshops at Sebastopol. It would, no doubt, have been a delightful trip, but it was not to be. The unfortunate disruption occurred between our Government and that of Russia, which culminated in the disastrous Crimean War. One of the first victims was Admiral Kornileff.  He was killed by one of our first shots while engaged in placing some guns for the defence of the entrance to the harbour of Sebastopol.\\n\\nCHAPTER 18.  Astronomical pursuits.\\n\\nLet me turn for a time from the Foundry, the whirr of the self-acting tools, and the sound of the steam hammers, to my quieter pursuits at home. There I had much tranquil enjoyment in the company of my dear wife. I had many hobbies.  Drawing was as familiar to me as language. Indeed, it was often my method of speaking.  It has always been the way in which I have illustrated my thoughts.  In the course of my journeys at home and abroad I made many drawings of places and objects, which were always full of interest, to me at least; and they never ceased to bring up a store of happy remembrances.\\n\\nNow and then I drew upon my fancy, and with pen and ink I conjured up \\\"The Castle of Udolpho,\\\" \\\" A Bit of Old England,\\\" \\\"The Fairies are Out,\\\" and \\\"Everybody for Ever.\\\"  The last is crowded with thousands of figures and heads, so that it is almost impossible to condense the drawing into a small compass.  To these I added \\\"The Alchemist,\\\" \\\"Old Mortality,\\\" \\\"Robinson Crusoe,\\\" and a bit of English scenery, which I called \\\"Gathering Sticks.\\\"  I need not say with how much pleasure I executed these drawings in my evening hours.  They were not \\\"published,\\\" but I drew them with lithographic ink, and had them printed by Mr. Maclure. I afterwards made presents of the series to some of my most intimate friends.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The Antiquarian.  By James Nasmyth (Facsimile)\\n\\nIn remembrance of the great pleasure which I had derived from the perusal of Washington Irving's fascinating works, I sent him a copy of my sketches.  His answer was charming and characteristic. His letter was dated \\\" Sunnyside,\\\" Massachusetts, where he lived. He said (17th January 1859):\\n\\nDEAR SIR--Accept my most sincere and hearty thanks for the exquisite fancy sketches which you have had the kindness to send me, and for the expressions of esteem and regard in the letter which accompanied them. It is indeed a heartfelt gratification to me to think that I have been able by any exercise of my pen to awaken such warm and delicate sympathies, and to call forth such testimonials of pleasure and approbation from a person of your cultivated taste and intellectual elevation.  With high respect and regard, I remain, nay dear sir, your truly obliged friend, Washington Irving.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The Fairies.  By James Nasmyth.  (Facsimile)\\n\\nViscount Duncan, afterwards Earl Camperdown, also acknowledged receipt of the drawings in a characteristic letter.  He said: --\\\"We are quite delighted with them, especially with 'The Fairies,' which a lady to whom I showed them very nearly stole, as she declared that it quite realised her dreams of fairyland.  I am only surprised that amidst your numerous avocations you have found time to execute such detailed works of art; and I shall have much pleasure in being reminded as I look at the drawings that the same hand and head that executed them invented the steam hammer, and many other gigantic pieces of machinery which will tend to immortalise the Anglo-saxon race.\\\"\\n\\nBut my most favourite pursuit, after my daily exertions at the Foundry, was Astronomy.  There were frequently clear nights when the glorious objects in the Heavens were seen in most attractive beauty and brilliancy.\\n\\nI cannot find words to express the thoughts which the impressive grandeur of the Stars, seen in the silence of the night, suggested to me; especially when I directed my Telescope, even at random, on any portion of the clear sky, and considered that each Star of the multitude it revealed to me, was a SUN! the centre of a system! Myriads of such stars, invisible to the unassisted eye, were rendered perfectly distinct by the aid of the telescope.  The magnificence of the sight was vastly increased when the telescope was directed to any portion of the Milky Way.  It revealed such countless multitudes of stars that I had only to sit before the eyepiece, and behold the endless procession of these glorious objects pass before me. The motion of the earth assisted in changing this scene of inexpressible magnificence, which reached its climax when some object such as the \\\"Cluster in Hercules\\\" came into sight.  The component stars are so crowded together there as to give the cluster the appearance of a gray spot; but when examined with a telescope of large aperture, it becomes resolved into such myriads of stars as to defy all attempts to count them.  Nothing can convey to the mind, in so awful and impressive a manner, the magnificent and infinite extent of Creation, and the inconceivable power of its Creator!\\n\\nI had already a slight acquaintance with Astronomy.  My father had implanted in me the first germs.  He was a great admirer of that sublimest of sciences.  I had obtained a sufficient amount of technical knowledge to construct in 1827 a small but very effective reflecting telescope of six inches diameter.  Three years later I initiated Mr. Maudslay into the art and mystery of making a reflecting telescope. I then made a speculum of ten inches diameter, and but for the unhappy circumstance of his death in 1831, it would have been mounted in his proposed observatory at Norwood.  After I had settled down at Fireside, Patricroft, I desired to possess a telescope of considerable power in order to enjoy the tranquil pleasure of surveying the heavens in their impressive grandeur at night.\\n\\nAs I had all the means and appliances for casting specula at the factory, I soon had the felicity of embodying all my former self-acquired skill in this fine art by producing a very perfect casting of a ten-inch diameter speculum.  The alloy consisted of fifteen parts of pure tin and thirty-two parts of pure copper, with one part of arsenic.  It was cast with perfect soundness, and was ground and polished by a machine which I contrived for the purpose. The speculum was so brilliant that when my friend William Lassell saw it, he said \\\"it made his mouth water.\\\"  It was about this time (1840) that I had the great happiness of becoming acquainted with Mr. Lassell,\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Mr. Lassell was a man of superb powers.  Like many others who have done so much for astronomy, he started as an amateur. He was first apprenticed to a merchant at Liverpool.  He then began business as a brewer.  Eventually he devoted himself to astronomy and astronomical mechanics.  When in his twenty-first year he began constructing reflecting telescopes for himself.  He proceeded to make a Newtonian of nine inches aperture, which he erected in an observatory at his residence near Liverpool, happily named \\\"Starfield.\\\" With this instrument he worked diligently, and detected the sixth star in the trapezium of Orion.  In 1844 he conceived the bold idea of constructing a reflector of two feet aperture, and twenty feet focal length, to be mounted equatorially.  Sir John Herschel, in mentioning Mr. Lassell's work, did me the honour of saying \\\"that in Mr Nasmyth he was fortunate to find a mechanist capable of executing in the highest perfection all his conceptions, and prepared by his own love of astronomy and practical acquaintance with astronomical observations, and with the construction of specula, to give them their full effect.\\\" With this fine instrument Mr. Lassell discovered the satellite of Neptune.  He also discovered the eighth satellite of Saturn, of extreme minuteness, as well as two additional satellites of Uranus. But perhaps his best work was done at Malta with a much larger telescope, four feet in aperture, and thirty-seven feet focus, erected there in 1861.  He remained at Malta for three years, and published a catalogue of 600 new nebulae, which will be found in the Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society.  One of his curious sayings was, \\\"I have had a great deal to do with opticians, some of them--like Cooke of York--are really opticians; but the greater number of them are merely shopticians!\\\"  ...\\\\] and profiting by his devotion to astronomical pursuits and his profound knowledge of the subject.  He had acquired much technical skill in the construction of reflecting telescopes, and the companionship between us was thus rendered very agreeable.  There was an intimate exchange of opinions on the subject, and my friendship with him continued during forty successive years.  I was perhaps a little ahead of him in certain respects.  I had more practical knowledge of casting, for I had begun when a boy in my bedroom at Edinburgh.  In course of time I contrived many practical \\\"dodges\\\" (if I may use such a word), and could nimbly vault over difficulties of a special kind which had hitherto formed a barrier in the way of amateur speculum makers when fighting their way to a home-made telescope.  I may mention that I know of no mechanical pursuit in connection with science, that offers such an opportunity for practising the technical arts, as that of constructing from first to last a complete Newtonian or Gregorian Reflecting Telescope. Such an enterprise brings before the amateur a succession of the most interesting and instructive mechanical arts, and obliges the experimenter to exercise the faculty of delicate manipulation. If I were asked what course of practice was the best to instil a true taste for refined mechanical work, I should say, set to and make for yourself from first to last a reflecting telescope with a metallic speculum.  Buy nothing but the raw material, and work your way to the possession of a telescope by means of your own individual labour and skill.  If you do your work with the care, intelligence, and patience that is necessary, you will find a glorious reward in the enhanced enjoyment of a night with the heavens--all the result of your own ingenuity and handiwork.  It will prove a source of abundant pleasure and of infinite enjoyment for the rest of your life.\\n\\nI well remember the visit I received from my dear friend Warren de la Rue in the year 1840.  I was executing some work for him with respect to a new process which he had contrived for the production of white lead. I was then busy with the casting of my thirteen-inch speculum. He watched my proceedings with earnest interest and most careful attention.  He told me many years after, that it was the sight of my special process of casting a sound speculum that in a manner caused him to turn his thoughts to practical astronomy, a subject in which he has exhibited such noble devotion as well as masterly skill.  Soon after his visit I had the honour of casting for him a thirteen-inch speculum, which he afterwards ground and polished by a method of his own. He mounted it in an equatorial instrument of such surpassing excellence as enabled him, aided by his devotion and pure love of the subject, to record a series of observations and results which will hand his name down to posterity as one of the most faithful and patient of astronomical observers.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Fireside, Patricroft.  After a drawing by James Nasmyth\\n\\nBut to return to my own little work at Patricroft.  I mounted my ten-inch home-made reflecting telescope, and began my survey of the heavens.  Need I say with what exquisite delight the harmony of their splendour filled me.  I began as a learner, and my learning grew with experience.  There were the prominent stars, the planets, the Milky Way --with thousands of far-off suns--to be seen.  My observations were at first merely general; by degrees they became particular. I was not satisfied with enjoying these sights myself; I made my friends and neighbours sharers in my pleasure; and some of them enjoyed the wonders of the heavens as much as I did.\\n\\nIn my early use of the telescope I had fitted the speculum into a light square tube of deal to which the eye-piece was attached, so as to have all the essential parts of the telescope combined together in the most simple and portable form.  I had often to remove it from place to place in my small garden at the side of the Bridgewater Canal, in order to get it clear of the trees and branches which intercepted some object in the heavens which I wished to see.  How eager and enthusiastic I was in those days!  Sometimes I got out of bed in the clear small hours of the morning, and went down to the garden in my night-shirt.  I would take the telescope in my arms and plant it in some suitable spot, where I might get a peep at some special planet or star then above the horizon.\\n\\nIt became bruited about that a ghost was seen at Patricroft! A barge was silently gliding along the canal near midnight, when the boatman suddenly saw a figure in white. \\\"It moved among the trees with a coffin in its arms!\\\" The apparition was so sudden and strange that he immediately concluded that it was a ghost.  The weird sight was reported at the stations along the canal, and also at Wolverhampton, which was the boatman's headquarters.  He told the people at Patricroft on his return journey what he had seen, and great was the excitement produced.  The place was haunted:  there was no doubt about it!  After all, the rumour was founded on fact, for the ghost was merely myself in my night-shirt, and the coffin was my telescope, which I was quietly shifting from one place to another in order to get a clearer sight of the heavens at midnight.\\n\\nMy ambition expanded.  I now resolved to construct a reflecting telescope of considerably greater power than that which I possessed. I made one of twenty inches diameter, and mounted it on a very simple plan, thus removing many of the inconveniences and even personal risks that attend the use of such instruments.  (For illustration of the plan of mounting a large telescope, see p. 338) It had been necessary to mount steps or ladders to get at the eyepiece, especially when the objects to be observed were at a high elevation above the horizon. I now prepared to do some special work with this instrument. In 1842 I began my systematic researches upon the Moon.  I carefully and minutely scrutinised the marvellous details of its surface, a pursuit which I continued for many years, and still continue with ardour until this day.  My method was as follows: --\\n\\nI availed myself of every favourable opportunity for carrying on the investigation.  I made careful drawings with black and white chalk on large sheets of grey-tinted paper, of such selected portions of the Moon as embodied the most characteristic and instructive features of her wonderful surface.  I was thus enabled to graphically represent the details with due fidelity as to form, as well as with regard to the striking effect of the original in its masses of light and shade. I thus educated my eye for the special object by systematic and careful observation, and at the same time practised my hand in no less careful delineation of all that was so distinctly presented to me by the telescope--at the side of which my sheet of paper was handily fixed. I became in a manner familiar with the vast variety of those distinct manifestations of volcanic action, which at some inconceivably remote period had produced these wonderful features and details of the moon's surface.  So far as could be observed, there was an entire absence of any agency of change, so that their formation must have remained absolutely intact since the original cosmical heat of the moon had passed rapidly into space.  The surface, with all its wondrous details, presents the same aspect as it did probably millions of ages ago.\\n\\nThis consideration vastly enhances the deep interest with which we look upon the moon and its volcanic details.  It is totally without an atmosphere, or of a vapour envelope, such as the earth possesses, and which must have contributed to the conservation of the cosmical heat of the latter orb.  The moon is of relatively small mass, and is consequently inferior in heat-retaining power.  It must thus have parted with its original stock of cosmical heat with such rapidity as to bring about the final termination of those surface changes which give it so peculiar an aspect.  In the case of the earth the internal heat still continues in operation, though in a vastly reduced degree of activity.  Again in the case of the moon, the total absence of water as well as atmosphere has removed from it all those denudative activities which, in the earth, have acted so powerfully in effecting changes of its surfaces as well as in the distribution of its materials. Hence the appearance of the wonderful details of the moon's surface presents us with objects of inconceivably remote antiquity.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  General structure of Lunar craters.\\n\\nAnother striking characteristic of the moon's surface is the enormous magnitude of its volcanic crater formations.  In comparison with these, the greatest on the surface of the earth are reduced to insignificance. Paradoxical as the statement may at first appear, the magnitude of the remains of the primitive volcanic energy in the moon is simply due to the smallness of its mass.  Being only about one-eightieth part of the bulk of the earth, the force of gravity on the moon's surface is only about one-sixth.  And as eruptive force is quite independent, as a force, of the law of gravitation, and as it acted with its full energy on matter, which in the moon is little heavier than cork, it was dispersed in divergent flight from the vent of the volcanoes, free from any atmospheric resistance, and thus secured an enormously wider dispersion of the ejected scoriae.  Hence the building up of those enormous ring-formed craters which are seen in such vast numbers on the moon's surface--some of them being no less than a hundred miles in diameter, with which those of Etna and Vesuvius are the merest molehills in comparison.\\n\\nI may mention, in passing, that the frequency of a central cone within these ring-shaped lunar craters supplies us with one of the most distinct and unquestionable evidences of the true nature and mode of the formation of volcanoes.\",\"timestamp\":1639290548,\"title\":\"\\nThis latter department included all processes connected with explosives.
