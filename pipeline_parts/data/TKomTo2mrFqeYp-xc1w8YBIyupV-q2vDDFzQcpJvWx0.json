"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Well, sir, it is near a fortnight since I heard from her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will say what is that to you? But the truth is, she left me, in London, to do certain business for her, and she went down to this very place. I offered to come with her, but she declined. To be sure, it was a delicate matter, and not at all in my way. She was to write to me and report progress, and give me her address, that I might write to her; but nearly a fortnight has passed. I have not received a single letter. I am in real distress and anxiety. A great career awaits her in England, sir; but this silence is so mysterious, so alarming, that I begin actually to hope she has played the fool, and thrown it all up, and gone abroad with that blackguard.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What blackguard, sir?\\\"\\n\\nJoseph drew in his horns. \\\"I spoke too quick, sir,\\\" said he; \\\"it is no business of mine. But these brilliant women are as mad as the rest in throwing away their affections. They prefer a blackguard to a good man. It is the rule. Excuse my plain speaking.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Ashmead,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"I may be able to answer your questions about this lady; but, before I do so, it is right I should know how far you possess her confidence. To speak plainly, have you any objection to tell me what is the precise relation between you and her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Certainly not, sir. I am her theatrical agent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not quite. I have been a good deal about her lately, and have seen her in deep distress. I think I may almost say I am her friend, though a very humble one.\\\"\\n\\nVizard did not yet quite realize the truth that this Bohemian had in his heart one holy spot--his pure devotion and unsexual friendship for that great artist. Still, his prejudices were disarmed, and he said, \\\"Well, Mr. Ashmead, excuse my cross-questioning you. I will now give myself the pleasure of setting your anxieties at rest. Mademoiselle Klosking is in this house.\\\"\\n\\nAshmead stared at him, and then broke out, \\\"In this house! O Lord! How can that be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It happened in a way very distressing to us all, though the result is now so delightful. Mademoiselle Klosking called here on a business with which, perhaps, you are acquainted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am, sir.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Unfortunately she met with an accident in my very hall, an accident that endangered her life, sir; and of course we took charge of her. She has had a zealous physician and good nurses, and she is recovering slowly. She is quite out of danger, but still weak. I have no doubt she will be delighted to see you. Only, as we are all under the orders of her physician, and that physician is a woman, and a bit of a vixen, you must allow me to go and consult her first.\\\" Vizard retired, leaving Joseph happy, but mystified.\\n\\nHe was not long alone. In less than a minute he had for companions some well-buttered sandwiches made with smoked ham, and a bottle of old Madeira. The solids melted in his mouth, the liquid ran through his veins like oil charged with electricity and *elixir vitoe.*\\n\\nBy-and-by a female servant came for him, and ushered him into Ina Klosking's room.\\n\\nShe received him with undisguised affection, and he had much ado to keep from crying. She made him sit down near her in the vast embrasure of the window, and gave him a letter to read she had just written to him.\\n\\nThey compared notes very rapidly; but their discourse will not be given here, because so much of it would be repetition.\\n\\nThey were left alone to talk, and they did talk for more than an hour. The first interruption, indeed, was a recitativo with chords, followed by a verse from the leading treble.\\n\\nMr. Ashmead looked puzzled; the Klosking eyed him demurely.\\n\\nBefore the anthem concluded, Vizard tapped, and was admitted from the music-room. Ina smiled, and waved him to a chair. Both the men saw, by her manner, they were not to utter a sound while the music was going on. When it ceased, she said, \\\"Do you approve that, my friend?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If it pleases you, madam,\\\" replied the wary Ashmead.\\n\\n\\\"It does more than please me; it does me good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That reconciles me to it at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, then you do not admire it for itself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not--very--much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pray, speak plainly. I am not a tyrant, to impose my tastes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well then, madam, I feel very grateful to anything that does you good: otherwise, I should say the music was--rather dreary; and the singing--very insipid.\\\"\\n\\nThe open struggle between Joseph's honesty and his awe of the Klosking tickled Vizard so that he leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.\\n\\nThe Klosking smiled superior. \\\"He means,\\\" said she, \\\"that the music is not operatic, and the boys do not clasp their hands, and shake their shoulders, and sing passionately, as women do in a theater. Heaven forbid they should! If this world is all passion, there is another which is all peace; and these boys' sweet, artless tones are the nearest thing we shall get in this world to the unimpassioned voices of the angels. They are fit instruments for pious words set by composers, who, however obscure they may be, were men inspired, and have written immortal strains, which, as I hear them, seem hardly of this world--they are so free from all mortal dross.\\\"\\n\\nVizard assented warmly. Ashmead asked permission to hear another. They sung the \\\"Magnificat\\\" by King, in F.\\n\\n\\\"Upon my word,\\\" said Ashmead, \\\"there is a deal of 'go' in that.\\\"\\n\\nThen they sung the \\\"Nuno Dimittis.\\\" He said, a little dryly, there was plenty of repose in that.\\n\\n\\\"My friend,\\\" said she, \\\"there is--to the honor of the composer: the 'Magnificat' is the bright and lofty exultation of a young woman who has borne the Messiah, and does not foresee His sufferings, only the boon to the world and the glory to herself. But the 'Dimittis' is the very opposite. It is a gentle joy, and the world contentedly resigned by a good old man, fatigued, who has run his race, and longs to sleep after life's fever. When next you have the good fortune to hear that song, think you see the sun descending red and calm after a day of storms, and an aged Christian saying, 'Good-night,' and you will honor poor dead King as I do. The music that truly reflects great words was never yet small music, write it who may.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are right, madam.\\\" said Ashmead. \\\"When I doubted its being good music, I suppose I meant salable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, *voil'a!\\\"* said the Klosking. Then, turning to Vizard for sympathy, \\\"What this faithful friend understands by good music is music that can be sold for a good deal of money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is so,\\\" said Ashmead, stoutly. \\\"I am a theatrical agent. You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. You have tried it more than once, you know, but it would not work.\\\"\\n\\nAshmead amused Vizard, and he took him into his study, and had some more conversation with him. He even asked him to stay in the house; but Ashmead was shy, and there was a theater at Taddington. So he said he had a good deal of business to do; he had better make the \\\"Swan\\\" his headquarters. \\\"I shall be at your service all the same, sir, or Mademoiselle Klosking's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have a glass of Madeira, Mr. Ashmead.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, sir, to tell the truth, I have had one or two.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then it knows the road.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are very good, sir. What Madeira! Is this the wine the doctors ran down a few years ago? They couldn't have tasted it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, it is like ourselves, improved by traveling. That has been twice to India.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It will never go again past me,\\\" said Ashmead, gayly. \\\"My mouth is a cape it will never weather.\\\"\\n\\nHe went to his inn.\\n\\nBefore he had been there ten minutes, up rattled a smart servant in a smart dogcart.\\n\\n\\\"Hamper--for Joseph Ashmead, Esquire.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Anything to pay?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What for?--it's from Vizard Court.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the dog-cart rattled away.\\n\\nJoseph was in the hall, and witnessed this phenomenon. He said to himself, \\\"I wish I had a vast acquaintance--ALL COUNTRY GENTLEMEN.\\\"\\n\\nThat afternoon Ina Klosking insisted on walking up and down the room, supported by Mesdemoiselles Gale and Dover. The result was fatigue and sleep; that is all.\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow,\\\" said she, \\\"I will have but one live crutch. I must and will recover my strength.\\\"\\n\\nIn the evening she insisted on both ladies dining with Mr. Vizard. Here, too, she had her way.\\n\\nVizard was in very good spirits, and, when the servants were gone, complimented Miss Gale on her skill.\\n\\n*\\\"Our* skill, you mean,\\\" said she. \\\"It was you who prescribed this new medicine of the mind, the psalms and hymns and spiritual songs; and it was you who administered the Ashmead, and he made her laugh, or nearly--and that *we* have never been able to do. She must take a few grains of Ashmead every day. The worst of it is, I am afraid we shall cure her too quickly; and then we shall lose her. But that was to be expected. I am very unfortunate in my attachments; I always was. If I fall in love with a woman, she is sure to hate me, or else die, or else fly away. I love this one to distraction, so she is sure to desert me, because she couldn't misbehave, and I won't *let* her die.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Vizard, \\\"you know what to do--retard the cure. That is one of the arts of your profession.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And so it is; but how can I, when I love her? No, we must have recourse to our benevolent tyrant again. He must get Miss Vizard back here, before my goddess is well enough to spread her wings and fly.\\\"\\n\\nVizard looked puzzled. \\\"This,\\\" said he \\\"sounds like a riddle, or female logic.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/36](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/36)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637671301,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Then I am sure you must have admired her, being a gentleman of taste. \"},\"digest\":\"Rs_8ZysMfl6Es0hA0VyQr7Ul_hL9PMijmf0SUdn1f1Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98485E752AD42d721892AE055281b72F1cA81833\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xSQloMxNH9JBHgzV9b_1MpOtSmeP96uQ6HN6rUmAeFI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wcsn8EZyERkkdhdK3Z6_CMRTQmibkZk1FWp8T9AjsH4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"v7-_GQnn9QY3FGoZQM0wa9L0aR6DYrOQLF151RQSspHvlmHbpqYIs19l1D-RFPnWhIpKvad2CbAsSVJK-qUEjw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf01766d2843bc2d8f9b5aff8fafc917521bac1b4d4c4a9a5dda93fd4f1b04dfb6cfb0e34d81054d61c3153c6cf538198226d2d871fafca2629493bc80f4b8c0a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xSQloMxNH9JBHgzV9b_1MpOtSmeP96uQ6HN6rUmAeFI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wcsn8EZyERkkdhdK3Z6_CMRTQmibkZk1FWp8T9AjsH4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Rs_8ZysMfl6Es0hA0VyQr7Ul_hL9PMijmf0SUdn1f1Y\"}"
