It's the perfect time to support our next generation of young innovators, creative leaders, and investors in Palm Beach. \\n\\n## UNITY H20 Debuting Saturday November 27\\n\\nCamilla is hosting the launch of her first NFT collection “Unity H20” this Saturday from 6-9pm and is extending an invitation to all Palm Tree Collective members to join.  \\n\\nUnity H20 is a conceptual art exhibit that combines art, tech, and finance.\\n\\nThis NFT series is an exciting new opportunity to join a global community passionate about life, the oceans, and our waterways.\\n\\nAt the event, you’ll be first to see her collection in beta, and trade before the next drop at Art Basel Miami. \\n\\nWe find the message behind the project to be extremely powerful:\\n\\n“For centuries, artists have painted and used the oceans as a means of telling and discovering stories about humans in search of a better future. Today, with climate change, pollution, and other threats, the stories of the oceans need artists to preserve and protect their vitality and all life that lies in and depends on Earth’s oceans.”\\n\\nEven more exciting, is that **a portion of each resale royalty will directly benefit the waterways the token represents**, really putting her money where her mouth is.\\n\\nHere's a link to her collections and some of her more traditional work. <https://opensea.io/collection/unityh20>\\n<https://opensea.io/collection/lovefrompalmbeachcw>\\n<https://www.camillawebster.com/work>\\n\\n\\nCamilla Webster Art\\nWork | Camilla Webster Art\\n\\nPS:\\nShe wants to gift one lucky art enthusiast with a piece from the collection just for coming to appreciate it in person this Saturday.\\n\\nAnyone who comes (including any +1s) can check in with me at the event for a chance to win another piece from the Love From Palm Beach Collection. We’ll randomly draw from everyone who attends.\",\"timestamp\":1637704011,\"title\":\"Love From Palm Beach by Camilla Webster\"},\"digest\":\"WIYpFoOiNhz-y2nRnRO1fZ5e_wxQr6UPJO2wlLveG5U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x452A89F1316798fDdC9D03f9af38b0586F8142e5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4vqsbZsyuVDW3iPxcuXV9ROYjyxKuFS4ReqVxJoW3JI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FizmfFMoWVypIpvB4cPwwW7Vx5UazntVgnZz8oLfK_I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jlBGNC_57rr1_QDUTkhsz8EZAvdFPf9lt3za0LnL8F8tuWG_jBYQWUq5xv1GEdApdG6feQ7rjRiP-IFuyDA3Jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6feb7d58451526f4444f89f5b1ea75397cd5150714ecdffa80162d5ec11885185bd4061e48229743deb986902d070baa73c7962d176ba026cdf96d7d64eb05781c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4vqsbZsyuVDW3iPxcuXV9ROYjyxKuFS4ReqVxJoW3JI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FizmfFMoWVypIpvB4cPwwW7Vx5UazntVgnZz8oLfK_I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WIYpFoOiNhz-y2nRnRO1fZ5e_wxQr6UPJO2wlLveG5U\"}"
