These use-cases include lending (Kashi), IDOs (Miso), and an upcoming NFT marketplace (Shoyu), thusshowcasing SushiSwap’s ambitions to become a DeFi super app. In terms of its core DEX product, activity across several key indicators has recovered, and it’s also soon to launch a new capital efficient DEX called Trident.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4d89234-47b4-4602-bebf-42320c2ea7f7\\\\_1600x844.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb4d89234-47b4-4602-bebf-42320c2ea7f7\\\\_1600x844.png)\\n\\n*   SushiSwap’s liquidity between its two main chains (Ethereum and Polygon) has rebounded by over 50% in the past month. In spite of growing competition, total liquidity supplied for the protocol remains above $4 billion and is within 30% of its previous all-time high. Trading activity and revenues have also been on an uptrend recently.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aaa5af4-193a-42bc-a74a-e82eed809642\\\\_1600x768.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9aaa5af4-193a-42bc-a74a-e82eed809642\\\\_1600x768.png)\\n\\n*   SushiSwap is projecting $60 million for xSUSHI stakers. Taking these as the protocol’s earnings, this would give SUSHI a P/E ratio of 38.5, which is significantly lower than Coinbase’s 160 P/E. SUSHI's P/E has been declining while SUSHI’s price has been increasing, getting cheaper relative to its revenues.\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa61913-7b01-42a1-b25f-2ffc339dc2cc\\\\_1600x790.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3aa61913-7b01-42a1-b25f-2ffc339dc2cc\\\\_1600x790.png)\\n\\n***\\n**About the editor:** [Spencer Noon](https://twitter.com/spencernoon) is General Partner at [Variant](https://variant.fund/), a first-check crypto VC fund.\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1629487124,\"title\":\"Our Network: Issue #84\",\"publication\":\"ournetwork\"},\"digest\":\"8Y5Z8kuZZpRR-O3m4BSo_iqNhOC3ih--igSo6GFKkX0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9C159121CEEBF937E9bad98fd0c895d7f6038bd4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yCVplsyUXEs7v2HTvRhTZVfCqCN7b7RQ3I1AcxErWew\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U1uUFVirm370rVUI6zRrEqJjYQqY8OHOCkKBpESw0ew\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dQWDqAzieypioE6KICpTsGNTwjjjZj39O6NzOJ3UKRPEdbQcFjgzMSIOVMMotibEfxduqgyXjigEytCjwdPyqg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5655ebc546a01ca7767ebf514cbaf130ace52da7cd93f720d2fb601e6aa694d2003e82594e7f44369be5426c14f4e445e0199ed5b96dc6d62991334fb52404ff01\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on ournetwork.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"yCVplsyUXEs7v2HTvRhTZVfCqCN7b7RQ3I1AcxErWew\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"U1uUFVirm370rVUI6zRrEqJjYQqY8OHOCkKBpESw0ew\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_E2p6U2vy2sDStjPkogn36KwRwIgWQ1_4XQMnNFis6A\"}"
