"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) is breaking the bank with the biggest campaign crypto has seen to date.\\n\\nHere's why it matters\\n\\nBefore we go into the details, unless you've been in a cave the last 2 weeks, you know [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) has been getting lots of attention. This is their original press release on their new global campaign\\n\\n<https://blog.crypto.com/crypto-com-launches-global-brand-campaign/>\\n\\nThis includes (not only):\\n\\n* Video with Matt Damon\\n* Billboards worldwide\\n* Social media\\n* Paid ads on all main platforms\\n* PR\\n* And now, in a stunt for the books, renaming Staples Center as [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) Arena\\n\\n<https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1460840630779887616>\\n\\nBack to the question, why does it matter?\\n\\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) employs 2.6k people across the world, has >10M users and one of the strongest brands in the industry.\\n\\nFor comparison, Binance has around 28M, Metamask 10M, Uniswap 2.5M and Kucoin 2M\\n\\nSo, [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) is a big market player\\n\\nThe key difference between all of those players and [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) is:\\n\\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) is much more user friendly.\\n\\nRetail won't care about slippage, gas fees, crosschain compatibility and so on.\\n\\nMass adoption won't come until people can use crypto without worrying about these things\\n\\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) solves that for them:\\n\\n* Easy to use app, similar to Revolut\\n* Buy and trade cryptos paying for \\\"\\\"fees\\\"\\\" but without caring about what's involved in them\\n* Use your funds to pay IRL with their Visa cards\\n\\nIn summary, something people can learn how to use\\n\\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) users can own crypto, speculate, be in the space, without the learning curve and with quick access to their funds.\\n\\nRetail won't be convinced to join Discord servers and understand liquidity pools.\\n\\nUntil it's made easy for them, they won't join\\n\\nThese guys are going after that market, and with this move, they prove they are going big.\\n\\nBinance is also trying to make simple versions of their products, but that is within a huge suite of them.\\n\\n[Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com) is all in on simplicity, and that's a good strategy.\\n\\nThe CRO token has been growing fast since the launch and still, at a 12b valuation, long term, it seems small.\\n\\nWe all know crypto will get mass adoption in due time. Gaming and NFTs will be a big part, but fungible tokens alone will too, and [crypto.com](http://crypto.com) is ready to absorb it\",\"timestamp\":1637234682,\"title\":\"Crypto.com gets it\"},\"digest\":\"Y0ajSpqxSExKSjd_BOPW-YSu-VwxZwVyd_Ew7mVM1y4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x47BAf10cA8BF727ab967bDccbF64997F99bac9D5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fL8S-87-VvnHP-fIIU9E9BeXaFI27zt-zbbJecAf7vs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f5UVTV_gftzcSwrbz90SnMEqNdw6Iw1apyxftOOa-ws\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aISx1NpBv-bk0aZp-hu0uTyq7l2lotwl9CttGSVTatGLX2cx51VX25IeoKVsWx-WLipjZ669LtW2hs4FLPEtyw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb098939a5fcf38907d7109cc9fa105e8f23f928df3064bf8530cb8c24dc5f4c20dbf5e9cefa9bf30bc67414bccfeaffeadd28d616772ea63a7429264d0acaf3a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fL8S-87-VvnHP-fIIU9E9BeXaFI27zt-zbbJecAf7vs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"f5UVTV_gftzcSwrbz90SnMEqNdw6Iw1apyxftOOa-ws\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Y0ajSpqxSExKSjd_BOPW-YSu-VwxZwVyd_Ew7mVM1y4\"}"
