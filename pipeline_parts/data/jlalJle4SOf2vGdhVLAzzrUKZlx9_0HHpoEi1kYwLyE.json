Its MP, Simon Fell, told the Guardian that although he did not underestimate the seriousness of the Omicron variant, he could not support the measures proposed, most specifically the so-called COVID passport of vaccine status.\\n\\n\\\"We are not a 'papers please' society, and such passports would be an unethical and discriminatory step,\\\" he said. \\\"I will not be supporting their introduction.\\\"\\n\\nAnother MP, William Wragg, who is on the executive committee of the influential backbench Conservative MPs' 1922 Committee, said he felt \\\"immense frustration\\\" at the government deciding to back a policy it had previously said it would not, adding that such measures were \\\"jumping the gun\\\" and \\\"going too fast\\\".\\n\\nAnother backbencher, Steve Baker, the self-styled 'hardman of Brexit', who in 2018 submitted a letter of no confidence in then-Prime Minister Theresa May over her Brexit policy, and who has also criticized the current government's net-zero carbon emissions plans, said he would \\\"of course\\\" vote against the measures.\\n\\n\\\"I'll vote against extending mask mandates, and I'll vote against mandatory vaccination as a condition of (National Health Service) employment,\\\" he told BBC Breakfast.\\n\\n\\\"I think all these things are wrong, they're disproportionate and there's inadequate evidence that they're required. And I really think this is the crucial point here now, what's on the table is what kind of society we're creating as we go forward.\\\"\\n\\nLater this week, voters will have their chance to pass judgement on Johnson's government, when a by-election takes place in North Shropshire.\\n\\nUsually a very safe Conservative seat, its former MP Owen Paterson resigned last month after government attempts to reverse his suspension from Parliament over having broken lobbying rules provoked public outrage.\",\"timestamp\":1639492604,\"title\":\"Threat of MP rebellion adds to Johnson's woes\"},\"digest\":\"h7poFW-bBUQX5ME5wSrDVHZ1aVm0A_ywfmE350WLV38\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3727dB8D15f2F74944bd38519645F4cEAc4DB752\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fXuaCtPnHeZqIgbei0lG4W7noG42fUoHP28ENYQ6q38\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kCEE1kS7ymuzujYX9Qv2YCxvdDdOJoAZUL61NAfpThY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bSx8nVrATssZjBVHp7Fk1SDt4M20N0hTJlCBmSBWz9UotRIZ4SEszR51uUF5_BkHTcv5b8mBtr_4NNkd0ObJYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1ea7cbeec81830892b1d3c458fa58133cd410383dce266accff132f57742d9a46a5bfb0d4972908141b49382ecd3cf9dedb0b3917870078bca7d868d06088bd81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fXuaCtPnHeZqIgbei0lG4W7noG42fUoHP28ENYQ6q38\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kCEE1kS7ymuzujYX9Qv2YCxvdDdOJoAZUL61NAfpThY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"h7poFW-bBUQX5ME5wSrDVHZ1aVm0A_ywfmE350WLV38\"}"
