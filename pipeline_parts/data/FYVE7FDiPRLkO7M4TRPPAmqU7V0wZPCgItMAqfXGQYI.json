"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Introduction:** On January 18, the first round of fundraising of Token — COKE was hotly subscribed under the governance of BitCoke trading platform. In this regard, investors said that behind the high recognition of COKE by the market is its huge discount effect and the possibility of bringing a new round of wealth creation opportunities to investors.\\n\\nOn January 18th, the trading platform BitCoke ushered in an epic development node, and the platform Token COKE finally launched the public offering process which was eagerly awaited by investors. \\n\\nTherefore, many senior investors said that the public offering of Token in COKE platform is expected to bring a new round of wealth creation opportunities for investors. \\n\\nAccording to the latest news, within the first hour of COKE’s public offering on the 18th, it received more than $10 million in subscriptions from investors.\\n\\nThe hot subscription of COKE shows that the investment value of the platform Token is highly recognized by investors, and it also means that the BitCoke trading platform will usher in a predictable development prospect.\\n\\nSome investors said that they wanted to recommend the BitCoke trading platform for a long time, but due to the lack of Tokens on the platform, they had to give up the thought. \\n\\nNow, with the launch of COKE, we can finally recommend this trading platform to the public. They believe that COKE will provide investors with more trading options and new investment opportunities.\\n\\nAnother investor, Kking2020, starting from the attributes of COKE, believes that COKE will likely bring a hundredfold growth space after in-depth comparison with the tokens of other trading platforms. For ordinary investors, it is a great opportunity to change fate and realize financial freedom.\\n\\n“An unique hybrid contract doesn’t show up in the trading platform track. BTC, ETH, USDT is supported for margin trading and settlement contracts and gives users the right to choose the type of Token in settlement or whatever they want earning for Token or U, which eliminates cumbersome Token exchange process and high Token exchange fees and considers as a humanized way.” Kking2020 wrote in the public album through social platforms.\\n\\nAs a well-known blockchain trading platform, BitCoke has a good reputation in the industry due to its excellent product design, easy-to-use APP and convenient transactions. The public offering of COKE this time has strongly attracted the attention of investors, and it was snapped up by investors within an hour of its launch.\\n\\nSo, what is the magic of COKE that makes investors drool? What advantages does it have over other platforms?\\n\\nIt has a low cost and provides wealth creation opportunities for common investors\\n\\nAccording to the official website of the BitCoke trading platform, COKE is expected to release 1 billion pieces. In this public offering, the amount raised is 20 million, accounting for 2% of the total COKE issuance. The public offering price is only $0.5 per piece.\\n\\n![Image Source：https://www.bitcoke.cc/coke](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Oc_8c3UslpYxs7oJ-H2-6.png?height=262&width=830)\\n\\nLong before the launch of the public offering, industry veteran Kking2020 made a bold prediction. He said that from the financial disclosure data of the BitCoke trading platform in the first half of the year, it can be inferred that the annual fee income of BitCoke is about 50 million US dollars to 80 million US dollars, which is not counting the ecological income of other platforms. \\n\\nBased on an average price-to-earnings ratio of 35 times for blockchain trading platforms, BitCoke’s market capitalization should be between $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion. Based on this calculation, in the case of 1 billion COKE in full circulation, the reasonable value of COKE should be between $1.8 and $2.8.\\n\\nFrom the public offering, the price of this public offering is only $0.5. Even if it is calculated at the lowest estimate of US $1.8 per token, this COKE public offering will be significantly discounted by more than 70% from the reasonable value.\\n\\n![Image Source：https://www.bitcoke.cc/](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wVRfAO73lAiLbyLhzIRSv.png?height=438&width=830)\\n\\nObviously, this public offering of COKE has given investors a chance to find advantages at a low level. What’s more, COKE also has a combustion deflation mechanism. The BitCoke trading platform stated that 33% of the transaction fee will be used for the repurchase and cancellation of COKE every year. \\n\\nThis means that with the repurchase and cancellation of COKE by the trading platform in the future, the single income corresponding to COKE will be further increased. In other words, COKE will become more and more valuable in the future.\\n\\nIn addition, through the public offering, the strength and governance capabilities of the BitCoke trading platform will also be strengthened, which is bound to improve the profitability of the platform. The BitCoke trading platform, whose profitability continues to improve, will also push up the intrinsic value of COKE.\\n\\nFor ordinary investors, public offering is the first step of the BitCoke trading platform, but it is not the only wealth-creating opportunity provided to investors. In fact, in addition to public offerings and secondary market transactions, the trading platform has also opened up trading channels between spot and secondary markets. \\n\\nIn the context of higher COKE in the secondary market, investors can also directly sell the spot in the secondary market, thereby realizing profits. From the perspective of the planning of the BitCoke trading platform, the proportion reserved for the spot market is about 40%, which reserves a window for node servicers, traders, and COKE holders to realize profits.\\n\\nHowever, from the overall development point of view, participation in fundraising is still the most direct, fastest and most effective way for investors to detect benefits.\\n\\nAttraction of BitCoke Trading Platform\\n\\nAmong the existing trading platforms in the crypto world, the reason why the BitCoke trading platform can get rid of the fierce competition is largely inseparable from the company’s technological innovation and deep understanding of digital assets.\\n\\nFor example, for most trading platforms, whether it is the first generation of perpetual contracts represented by inverse contracts or the second generation of perpetual contracts represented by positive contracts, it is difficult to achieve both making money and earning tokens. \\n\\nHowever, on the BitCoke trading platform, traders can use any Token among BTC, ETH, and USDT as trading margin through the introduction of innovative hybrid contracts. This provides convenience for traders to conduct multi-token transactions, and also makes it possible to earn tokens and make money at the same time.\\n\\nFor investors in the secondary market, charts and professional analysis tools are two indispensable tools for analyzing market conditions and assisting in trading decisions during the trading process. Based on a deep understanding of the market, the BitCoke trading platform has made comprehensive innovations. \\n\\nAt present, BitCoke trading platform is the only trading platform in the world with self-developed K-line, and it is also the only trading platform that can split-screen, line drawing and multi-terminal synchronization, K-line pending orders, VPVR and other more than 100 technical indicators. Its unique fund account can set risk controls such as the maximum available leverage and maximum retracement of sub-accounts, which provides professional choices for asset management institutions.\\n\\nAs we all know, risk control, transaction fees, market depth, etc. are all key factors that affect returns. In this regard, the BitCoke trading platform provides a package of solutions. For example, in terms of margin ratio, BitCoke provides an optional leverage ratio scheme from 0 to 100 times. When trading, investors can flexibly match and apply for trading leverage according to their risk appetite, trading style and financial strength. In terms of transaction fees, BitCoke also almost provides the industry’s lowest standard, which saves traders a lot of transaction fees. \\n\\nIn addition, the market depth of the transaction contracts listed on the BitCoke trading platform is also significantly higher than other trading platforms.\\n\\nIt is worth mentioning that behind the continuous attraction of traders on the BitCoke trading platform is the rich industry experience and strong technological innovation capabilities of the company’s founding team. The 7 legendary programmers of BitCoke generally have a deep financial background, they are from the world’s leading international investment banks such as Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, and they have more than 20 years of technology development experience. \\n\\nThese experiences have helped BitCoke to establish a fast matching transaction system with the highest response speed in the industry, as well as a technologically advanced and secure settlement system. So far, the BitCoke trading platform is also the only trading platform in the world that dares to fully compensate for problems.\\n\\nThe content is intended for informational purposes and does not constitute any investment advice.\",\"timestamp\":1642737638,\"title\":\"COKE is hotly subscribed by investors, and the public offering is in progress\"},\"digest\":\"55L0MKJ8bBRxxg0x6Ta5qYQli48gifxRsvfPuTkTseA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa69847cac331B3Fe705f03609A5f38B5a428F9E6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"502mfG1fvhpOKcsMn3fKtzV7ttAz82zl5AgHdg7aa-4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ek8zDbR1z64oZlqBDBOyI6ReOEQPADZhPPXyO-8kSQM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"L4AEc1WFqNxmTmk4ils_i9u8IqiyISHlkEQCDvCQux9AYts1sE9EpVoBM-oOj5bp83Q90nl3TLRtwjyRZkokjA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x08f812ffe54398b6336b082aac21822214cb8f22790632e39dcff4552e4157f1001e3780bb928bb3d3c0a89bb45f2f57c1d9a94dd52b4379fa61446afb8bdc401c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"502mfG1fvhpOKcsMn3fKtzV7ttAz82zl5AgHdg7aa-4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ek8zDbR1z64oZlqBDBOyI6ReOEQPADZhPPXyO-8kSQM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"55L0MKJ8bBRxxg0x6Ta5qYQli48gifxRsvfPuTkTseA\"}"
