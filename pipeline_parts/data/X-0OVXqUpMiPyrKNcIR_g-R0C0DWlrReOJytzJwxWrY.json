It can be used for many useful scenarios, such as a unified digital currency receiving account, a portal for Dapp or decentralized website, passwordless login credentials and **[more](https://da.systems/)**.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + DAS\\n\\nDAS provides a cross-chain and globally unique decentralized account system. By integrating DAS API, WePiggy can replace the lengthy addresses of different chains on the website with globally unique and easily readable DAS account names.\\n\\nDAS can also enable the front-end of WePiggy to be decentralized. Registration, record management and renewal of DAS are all completed through smart contracts on the Nervos chain.\\n\\nBy combining wepiggy.bit.cc with the cross-chain decentralized account system (DAS), IPFS and centralized access portal (Cloudflare or bit.cc), it is possible to enable direct access to the decentralised version of WePiggy‚Äôs front-end in all browsers.\\n\\nIn the meantime, WePiggy will promote the widespread use of DAS, through its high quality DeFi community.\\n\\nTo the DAS community, they can enjoy the powerful and secure application of WePiggy. Not only lending but also diversified portfolio management, cross-chain asset transfer and more features will be released to the DAS community in the future.\\n\\n*‚ÄúThrough this integration, our enhanced security solution \\\\[Ark operation\\\\] will be more complete and will further eliminate the risks caused by users being unable to access the front-end. Also, as the first lending protocol to support DAS, this will bring WePiggy more display opportunities, greater influence, and greater adoption in the DAS community.‚Äù*\\n\\n‚Äì Ron, Zheng, Founder of WePiggy\\n\\n*‚ÄúDAS is an access portal for Web 3.0 applications and provides a unique identity for any Web 3.0 user are the two basic application scenarios of DAS. WePiggy has a strong and very active community. DAS‚Äôs integration with WePiggy is the implementation of the DAS application scenario, which will bring a demonstration effect to more Web3.0 applications.‚Äù*\\n\\n‚Äì Tim,Yang, Founder of DAS\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol.
