"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Once again, hello degens! \\n\\nIn this Mirror article I will try to showcase some DeFi projects on [Harmony Network](https://www.harmony.one/) which I think are worth looking at and maybe‚Ä¶ putting some pennies in?\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## - - - This is not a financial advise, please DYOR - - - \\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## But first, what the hell is Harmony?\\n\\n> *‚ÄúHarmony Project provides a blockchain structure with an open network of nodes for decentralized applications.‚Äù*\\n>\\n> *‚ÄúThe most important aspect of **this project is using sharding as the scaling technology**. This technology has been proved for scaling without compromising decentralization and security. This blockchain uses various security components to prevent attacks on the network.‚Äù*\\n>\\n> $ONE is the gas currency.\\n>\\n> [https://crypto-economy.com/harmony/](https://crypto-economy.com/harmony/)\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How to add Harmony network on MetaMask?\\n\\n* Go on [chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) and connect your wallet at the top right corner.\\n\\n![chainlist.org](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BuXhYvCtuVLYy7M1XnD1f.png?height=1017&width=1881)\\n\\n* Search for the Harmony network.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/69ERiocH3Ve9E0NiMohgP.png?height=73&width=684)\\n\\n* Add whichever Mainnet Shard you want (from Shard 0 to Shard 3). Basically, as explained earlier, Harmony uses sharding to scale its network. All these Shards are on the mainnet, so feel free to chose the one you like.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yD0Hsr1SeA0005Lux8Pep.png?height=562&width=1032)\\n\\n* Allow chainlist to add the network through MetaMask and‚Ä¶ Voil√† ! You‚Äôve successfully added the Harmony Mainnet to your wallet.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1 - DeFi Kingdoms $JEWEL - DEX + NFT + P2E ? üò±\\n\\nBasically, there are not a lot of big projects on Harmony as of now (11/09/2021), as the blockchain is still far from the other major L1s such as AVAX, SOL or LUNA in terms of marketcap and TVL.\\n\\n![Harmony $ONE is currently ranked #62 by marketcap](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QQGL0H6HZ9t35JgvPHaSl.png?height=97&width=245)\\n\\nThat is why we have to look deeply into the already big ones, as long as we‚Äôre early in this ecosystem. They‚Äôre the ones which are the most likely to remain strong and have a steady growth, with solid fundamentals and innovations.\\n\\n![DeFi Kingdoms ($JEWEL) is ranked #332 globally, and is the biggest project by marketcap and volume on Harmony as of now.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9eK-XkvyoeUsCyWlTsmF_.png?height=671&width=1330)\\n\\n* **Link to the dApp :** \\n\\n[https://game.defikingdoms.com/](https://game.defikingdoms.com/)\\n\\n* What makes DeFi Kingfoms my first choice?\\n  * DeFi Kingdoms is a game, a DEX, a liquidity pool opportunity, a market of rare utility driven NFTs, and it all plays out seamlessly in the incredibly nostalgic form of fantasy pixel art.\\n    * **Yes, it combines DeFi with gaming, NFTs and P2E.**\\n  * I love the visual theme and the soundtrack is magic.\\n  * Each functionality is presented in its own ‚Äúzone‚Äù located in a specific part of the World Map, which acts as the main page of the protocol.\\n    * Farming, Staking, Swap etc‚Ä¶ all of these services which are the main components of a DEX are **beautifully turned into a gaming experience**, and that is what impressed me the most.\\n  * The protocol also includes sustainable tokenomics, incentives and **very juicy APRs**.\\n  * *A Dedicated Team and a Shared Vision*\\n\\n    > *‚ÄúWe wanted a dex that allows holders to not just hold a monetary token, but own a token that is usable, valuable, and that gives back to holders in many fun ways. We‚Äôve packaged DeFi elements into a fun and synergistic game, providing JEWEL token holders with an engaging and meaningful experience. We‚Äôre here for the long term, planning features for phases soon to come, and some a little further down the road to set this community and project up for maximum awesomeness.*‚Äù\\n    >\\n    > \\\\- Defi Kingdoms\\n\\n![Screenshot of the farming page.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VJGpSk-TCuamKqFkAov_O.png?height=1009&width=1920)\\n\\n* There are lots of new things to come, the roadmap is full and aimed for the long term (2022).\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### DeFi Kingdoms LINKS : \\n\\n* [Guide to the platform](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW6vp2Ba3Jc) (YouTube)\\n* [Documentation](https://docs.defikingdoms.com/) (MUST READ)\\n* [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/harmony)\\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DefiKingdoms) & [Medium](https://defikingdoms.medium.com/) \\n* [Discord](http://discord.gg/defikingdoms) & [telegram](http://t.me/defikingdoms)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Tranquil Finance $TRANQ üèß\\n\\n* **Link to the dApp :**\\n\\n[https://www.tranquil.finance/](https://www.tranquil.finance/)\\n\\nBasically, its the **lending/borrowing protocol** of Harmony.

It also offers liqudity mining, governance, vaults and gamification.\\n\\n> *Presenting Artemis, a multi-product Decentralized Finance protocol built on the Harmony Blockchain that strives to incubate those said components that build up composability: the projects and ideas. By bootstrapping these projects in a permissionless and decentralized manner by providing liquidity and exposure as a service, Artemis aims to solve what might be called the ‚Äúliquidity dilemma‚Äù, that is, creating forms of on-chain liquidity without sacrificing the network's decentralization - while offering attractive yields for risk-keen users.* \\n>\\n> *- Artemis Protocol* \\n\\n**Artemis has 4 services, ArtemisPad being the most important for us :**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/oCiRFH9tH8d1rnxmkJWwk.png?height=57&width=453)\\n\\n* Earn (Yield farming)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/woVXO9GIdNzjRWhxYLb4C.png?height=920&width=1509)\\n\\n> *‚ÄúArtemis Earn is a yield generating platform built on Artemis Protocol that aims to offer attractive returns for risk-keen users through three built-in products: liquidity mining, staking and vault strategies. Its goal? To fairly distribute MIS and allow participation in Artemis Governance and Launchpad / Incubator based products.‚Äù*\\n>\\n> *‚ÄúArtemis Earn has no account freezes, minimum / maximum deposits or signup requirements and it can be used by anyone in the world with access to a WiFi connection. **Yield simplified, with friction-less access.***\\n\\n* [Incubator](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis/the-protocol/launchpad-1/incubator)\\n\\n  > *‚ÄúThe Incubator is the core of Artemis fair token distribution capabilities for new projects. Our vision is for it to become the go-to liquidity as a service solution, where project owners set up farms in a permissionless manner to distribute their tokens.‚Äù*\\n  >\\n  > *‚ÄúSay Alice is working on a project and launched her coin ($ALI). Understandably, wants to fairly distribute it to holders while building liquidity for it, what Alice could do is visit Artemis, and seamlessly set up a MIS<>ALI farm that rewards farmers in ALI. Artemis governance would then review ALI and flag the project based on a set criteria.‚Äù*\\n* [ArtemisPad](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis/the-protocol/launchpad-1/artemispad) (see link for more infos)\\n\\n  > *‚ÄúArtemisPad, a token launchpad for forthcoming projects in the Harmony ecosystem, will be one of Artemis first integrated products. We aim to decentralize the way ideas raise capital, by aligning interests of both users and creators via attractive incentives and yields.*\\n  >\\n  > *The ArtemisPad will allow projects to list at a fixed price, which will be maintained for as long as there are tokens remaining in the available supply for sale. This should ensure less volatility around a token launch and allows a project and its investors increased transparency over the amount of money raised and tokens sold. Fixed price commits solve three fundamental problems:*\\n  > 1. *1.Unfair token distribution and liquidity rug pulls.*\\n  > 2. *2.Prevents token dumps by private and seed investors.*\\n  > 3. *3.Reduces token offering costs on decentralized exchanges.*\\n  >\\n  > *When in work, projects wishing to distribute tokens through the ArtemisPad will be reviewed by [Harmony Universe](https://harmonyuniverse.one), a platform known as the central hub for Harmony Protocol projects, once the review is published, Artemis Governance will fairly decide if the project should be launched on the platform through voting.*‚Äù\\n  * **Basically**, you deposit $MIS & $ONE ($WONE), $MIS are locked until IDO ends and WONE represents your allocation $ and %.\\n    * There can be ‚Äútiers‚Äù which change based on the locked $MIS amount.\\n      * Tiers can change the price at which you buy during the IDO.\\n* Games \\n\\n  > *‚ÄúArtemis implemented a 'Games' platform to theprotocol that would require users to acquire MIS either through Artemis Earn or by swapping to it. Upon launch, Artemis will feature a [Lottery](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis/the-protocol/gamefi/lottery) and [The Wheel](https://artemis-protocol.gitbook.io/artemis/the-protocol/gamefi/wheel), both will help offset emissions by burning MIS. Soon after launch we will announce a partnership that will bring a third game to the platform, and finally, we aim to implement multiplayer card games.‚Äù*\\n\\n  The first IDO launched by Artemis is $RVRS [(Reverse Protocol)](https://twitter.com/RVRSProtocol).\\n  * Reverse is a ‚ÄúOHMesque‚Äù protocol. (see the [documentation](https://reverse.gitbook.io/docs/))\\n\\n    **INFO : Artemis plans to launch on FANTOM Network.
