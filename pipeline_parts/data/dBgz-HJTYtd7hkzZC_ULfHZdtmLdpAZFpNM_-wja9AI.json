"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"X Protocol is developed based on Substrate architecture and is planned to be connected to Polkadot main network, Rococo, Kusama and other test networks to achieve cross-chain processing and analysis of assets on heterogeneous public chains such as BTC, ETH, Tron, EOS, Solana, BSC and Heco.\\n\\nIn other words, we can think of X Protocol as a public chain similar to Ethereum, which also has the function of smart contract. Just as we can develop dApps in different fields on Ethereum, we can also develop decentralized applications in various fields on X Protocol. To achieve different functions.\\n\\nIn addition, developing dApps on X Protocol has natural cross-chain advantages. After all, according to X Protocol's future plans, it will bid for Polkadot/Kusama parallel chain slots. When X Protocol becomes parallel chain in Boca network, The DApp we developed on X Protocol can be connected with other parallel chains in Boca network through X Protocol. In the future, when blockchain networks such as Ethereum, EOS and Wave Field become boca parallel chains, Dapps running on X Protocol can interact with mainstream blockchain networks such as Ethereum, EOS, and Wave field. This will save a lot of cross-chain development costs, and the project side can just focus on their business.\\n\\nIn addition, X Protocol project was granted Grant recognition by Web3 Foundation at the end of March, which to some extent shows that its business direction is recognized by Web3 Foundation. The projects granted by Web3 Foundation are mostly low-level basic protocol projects that can greatly promote boca ecology and even Web3.0 ecology. X Protocol is supported by the Web3 Foundation because of the impact it will have on the boca ecosystem.\\n\\nX Protocol, as a low-level Protocol class project running on Boca, will build business scenarios around the Protocol. Its business scope is also very suitable for the popular track in the current market, such as the current popular DeFi and NFT, social applications, and even the metauniverse. X Protocol has a layout, which means that we want to develop DeFi/NFT and other related Dapps in X Protocol. X Protocol has a well-established support system.\",\"timestamp\":1639475028,\"title\":\"DOT is once again in the spotlight.
