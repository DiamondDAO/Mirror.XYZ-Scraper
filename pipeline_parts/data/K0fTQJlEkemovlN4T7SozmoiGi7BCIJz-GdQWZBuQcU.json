"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"while acting as his chief draughtsman in connection with the triple and twin ships, and also while attending him at Leith and elsewhere, that it had considerably interfered with his practice; though everything was done by him con amore, in the best sense of the term.  In return for this, however, Mr. Miller made my father the generous offer of a loan to enable him to visit Italy, and pursue his studies there.  It was the most graceful mode in which Mr. Miller could express his obligations.  It was an offer pure and simple, without security, and as such was thankfully accepted by my father.\\n\\nIn those days an artist was scarcely considered to have completed his education until he had studied the works of the great masters at Florence and Rome.  My father left England for Italy on the 30th of December 1782.  He reached Rome in safety, and earnestly devoted himself to the study of art.  He remained in Italy for the greater part of two years.  He visited Florence, Bologna, Padua, and other cities where the finest artistic works were to be found.  He made studies and drawings of the best of them, besides making sketches from nature of the most remarkable places he had visited.  He returned to Edinburgh at the end of 1784, and immediately resumed his profession of a portrait painter.  He was so successful that in a short time he was enabled to repay his excellent friend Miller the #500 which he had so generously lent him a few years before.\\n\\nThe satisfactory results of his zealous practice, and of his skill and industry in his profession, together with the prospect of increasing artistic work, enabled him to bring to a happy conclusion an engagement he had entered into before leaving Edinburgh for Italy. I mean his marriage to my mother--one of the greatest events of his life which took place on the 3rd of January 1786.  Barbara Foulis was a distant relation of his own.  She was the daughter of William Foulis, Esq., of Woodhall and Colinton, near Edinburgh.  Her brother, the late Sir James Foulis, my uncle, succeeded to the ancient baronetcy of the family. See Burkes's Peerage and Baronetage\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... In Burke's Peerage and Baronetage an account is given of the Foulis family.  They are of Norman origin.  A branch settled in Scotland in the reign of Malcolm Canmore.  By various intermarriages, the Foulises are connected with the Hopetoun, Bute, and Rosebery families. The present holder of the title represents the houses of Colinton, Woodhall, and Ravelstone.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nMy mother did not bring with her any fortune, so to speak, in the way of gold or acres; but she brought something far better into my father's home,--a sweetness of disposition, and a large measure of common sense, which made her, in all respects, the devoted helpmate of her husband.  Her happy cheerful temperament, and her constant industry and attention, shed an influence upon all around her.  By her example she inbred in her children the love of truth, excellence, and goodness. That was indeed the best fortune she could bring into a good man's home.\\n\\nDuring the first year of my father's married life, when he lived in St. James's Square, he painted the well-known portrait of Robert Burns the poet.  Burns had been introduced to him by Mr. Miller at Dalswinton.  An intimate friendship sprang up between the artist and the poet.  The love of nature and of natural objects was common to both.  They also warmly sympathised in their political views. When Burns visited Edinburgh my father often met him.  Burns had a strange aversion to sit for his portrait, though often urgently requested to do so.  But when at my father's studio, Burns at last consented, and his portrait was rapidly painted.  It was done in the course of a few hours, and my father made a present of it to Mrs. Burns.\\n\\nA mezzotint engraving of it was afterwards published by William Walker, son-in-law of the famous Samuel Reynolds.  When the first proof impression was submitted to my father, he said to Mr. Walker: \\\"I cannot better express to you my opinion of your admirable engraving, than by telling you that it conveys to me a more true and lively remembrance of Burns than my own picture of him does; it so perfectly renders the spirit of his expression, as well as the details of his every feature.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Burns was in Edinburgh, my father had many interesting walks with him in the neighbourhood of the city.  The Calton Hill, Arthur's Seat, Salisbury Crags.  Habbie's How, and the nooks in the Pentlands, were always full of interest; and Burns, with his brilliant and humorous conversation, made the miles very short as they strode along.  Lockhart says, in his Life of Burns, that \\\"the magnificent scenery of the Scottish capital filled the poet with extraordinary delight.  In the spring mornings he walked very often to the top of Arthur's Seat, and, lying prostrate on the turf, surveyed the rising of the sun out of the sea in silent admiration; his chosen companion on such occasions being that learned artist and ardent lover of nature, Alexander Nasmyth.\\\"\\n\\nA visit which the two paid to Roslin Castle is worthy of commemoration. On one occasion my father and a few choice spirits had been spending a \\\"nicht wi' Burns.\\\"  The place of resort was a tavern in the High Street, Edinburgh.  As Burns was a brilliant talker, full of spirit and humour, time fled until the \\\"wee sma' hours ayont the twal'\\\" arrived. The party broke up about three o'clock.  At that time of the year (the 13th of June) the night is very short, and morning comes early. Burns, on reaching the street, looked up to the sky.  It was perfectly clear, and the rising sun was beginning to brighten the mural crown of St. Giles's Cathedral.\\n\\nBurns was so much struck with the beauty of the morning that he put his hand on my father's arm and said, \\\"It'll never do to go to bed in such a lovely morning as this!  Let's awa' to Roslin Castle.\\\"  No sooner said than done.  The poet and the painter set out.  Nature lay bright and lovely before them in that delicious summer morning.  After an eight-miles walk they reached the castle at Roslin.  Burns went down under the great Norman arch, where he stood rapt in speechless admiration of the scene.  The thought of the eternal renewal of youth and freshness of nature, contrasted with the crumbling decay of man's efforts to perpetuate his work, even when founded upon a rock, as Roslin Castle is, seemed greatly to affect him.\\n\\nMy father was so much impressed with the scene that, while Burns was standing under the arch, he took out his pencil and a scrap of paper and made a hasty sketch of the subject.  This sketch was highly treasured by my father, in remembrance of what must have been one of the most memorable days of his life.\\n\\nTalking of clubs reminds me that there was a good deal of club life in Edinburgh in those days.  The most notable were those in which the members were drawn together by occupations, habits, or tastes.  They met in the evenings, and conversed upon congenial subjects.  The clubs were generally held in one or other of the taverns situated in or near the High Street.  Every one will remember the Lawyers' Club, held in an Edinburgh close, presided over by Pleydell, so well described by Scott in Guy Mannering.\\n\\nIn my father's early days he was a member of a very jovial club, called the Poker Club.  It was so-called because the first chairman, immediately on his election, in a spirit of drollery, laid hold of the poker at the fireplace, and adopted it as his insignia of office. He made a humorous address from the chair, or \\\"the throne,\\\" as he called it, with sceptre or poker in hand; and the club was thereupon styled by acclamation \\\"The Poker Club.\\\"  I have seen my father's diploma of membership; it was tastefully drawn on parchment, with the poker duly emblazoned on it as the regalia of the club.\\n\\nIn my own time, the club that he was most connected with was the Dilettanti Club.  Its meetings were held every fortnight, on Thursday evenings, in a commodious tavern in the High Street.  The members were chiefly artists, or men known for their love of art.  Among then were Henry Raeburn, Hugh Williams (the Grecian), Andrew Geddes, William Thomson, John Shetkay, William Nicholson, William Allan, Alexander Nasmyth, the Rev. John Thomson of Duddingston, George Thomson, Sir Walter Scott, John Lockhart, Dr. Brewster, David Wilkie, Henry Cockburn, Francis Jeffrey, John A. Murray, Professor Wilson, John Ballantyne, James Ballantyne, James Hogg (the Ettrick Shepherd), and David Bridges, the secretary.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Davie Bridges was a character.  In my early days he was a cloth merchant in the High Street.  His shop was very near that gigantic lounge, the old Parliament House, and was often resorted to by non-business visitors.  Bridges had a good taste for pictures.  He had a small but choice collection by the Old Masters, which he kept arranged in the warehouse under his shop.  He took great pride in exhibiting them to his visitors, and expatiating upon their excellence. I remember being present in his warehouse with my father when a very beautiful small picture by Richard Wilson was under review.  Davie burst out emphatically with, \\\"Eh, man, did ye ever see such glorious buttery touches as on these clouds!\\\"  His joking friends clubbed him \\\"Director-General of the Fine Arts for Scotland,\\\" a title which he complacently accepted.  Besides showing off his pictures, Davie was an art critic, and wrote articles for the newspapers and magazines. Unfortunately, however, his attention to pictures prevented him from attending to his shop, and his customers (who were not artists) forsook him, and bought their clothes elsewhere.  He accordingly shut up his shop, and devoted himself to art criticism, in which, for a time, he possessed a monopoly.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nThe drinks were restricted to Edinburgh ale and whisky toddy.\\n\\nAn admirable picture of the club in full meeting was painted by William Allan, in which characteristic portraits of all the leading members were introduced in full social converse.  Among the more prominent portraits is one of my father, who is represented as illustrating some subject he is describing, by drawing it on the part of the table before him, with his finger dipped in toddy.  Other marked and well-known characteristics of the members are skilfully introduced in the picture. The artist afterwards sold it to Mr. Horrocks of Preston, in Lancashire.\\n\\nBesides portrait painting, my father was much employed in assisting the noblemen and landed gentry of Scotland in improving the landscape appearance of their estates, especially when seen from their mansion windows.  His fine taste, and his love of natural scenery, gave him great advantages in this respect.  He selected the finest sites for the new mansions, when they were erected in lieu of the old towers and crenellated castles.  Or, he designed alterations of the old buildings so as to preserve their romantic features, and at the same time to fit them for the requirements of modern domestic life.\\n\\nIn those early days of art-knowledge, there scarcely existed any artistic feeling for the landscape beauty of nature.  There was an utter want of appreciation of the dignified beauty of the old castles and mansions, the remnants of which were in too many instances carted away as material for now buildings.  There was also at that time an utter ignorance of the beauty and majesty of old trees.  A forest of venerable oaks or beeches was a thing to be done away with.  They were merely cut down as useless timber; even when they so finely embellished the landscape.  My father exerted himself successfully to preserve these grand old forest trees.  His fine sketches served to open the eyes of their possessors to the priceless treasures they were about to destroy; and he thus preserved the existence of many a picturesque old tree.  He even took the pains in many cases to model the part of the estate he was dealing with; and he also modelled the old trees he wished to preserve.  Thus, by a judicious clearing out of the intercepting young timber, he opened out distant views of the landscape, and at the same time preserved many a monarch of the forest.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... It is even now to be deeply deplored that those who inherit or come into possession of landed estates do not feel sufficiently impressed with the possession of such grand memorials of the past.  Alas! how often have we to lament the want of taste that leads to the sacrifice of these venerable treasures.  Would that the young men at our universities especially those likely to inherit estates--were impressed with the importance of preserving them. They would thus confer an inestimable benefit to thousands.  About forty years ago Lord Cockburn published a pamphlet on How to Destroy the Beauty of Edinburgh!  He enforced the charm of green foliage in combination with street architecture.  The burgesses were then cutting down trees. His lordship went so far as to say \\\"that he would as soon cut down a burgess as a tree!\\\"  Since then the growth of trees in Edinburgh, especially in what was once the North Loch, has been greatly improved; and might be still further improved if that famous tree, \\\"The London plane,\\\" were employed.  ...\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The Family Tree\\n\\nMy father modelled old castles, old trees, and such like objects as he wished to introduce into his landscapes.  The above illustration, may perhaps give a slight idea of his artistic skill as a modeller. I specially refer to this, which he called \\\"The Family Tree,\\\" as he required each member of his family to assist in its production. We each made a twig or small branch, which he cleverly fixed into its place as a part of the whole.  The model tree in question was constructed of wire slightly twisted together, so as to form the main body of a branch.  It was then subdivided into branchlets, and finally into individual twigs.  All these, combined together by his dexterous hand, resulted in the model of an old leafless tree, so true and correct, that any one would have thought that it had been modelled direct from nature.\\n\\nThe Duke of Athol consulted my father as to the improvements which he desired to make in his woodland scenery near Dunkeld.  The Duke was desirous that a rocky crag, called Craigybarns, should be planted with trees, to relieve the grim barrenness of its appearance.  But it was impossible for any man to climb the crag in order to set seeds or plants in the clefts of the rocks.  A happy idea struck my father. Having observed in front of the castle a pair of small cannon used for firing salutes, it occurred to him to turn them to account.  His object was to deposit the seeds of the various trees amongst the soil in the clefts of the crag.  A tinsmith in the village was ordered to make a number of canisters with covers.  The canisters were filled with all sorts of suitable tree seeds.  A cannon was loaded, and the canisters were fired up against the high face of the rock.  They burst and scattered the seed in all directions.  Some years after, when my father revisited the place, he was delighted to find that his scheme of planting by artillery had proved completely successful; for the trees were flourishing luxuriantly in all the recesses of the cliff. This was another instance of my father's happy faculty of resourcefulness.\\n\\nCertain circumstances about this time compelled my father almost entirely to give up portrait painting and betake himself to another branch of the fine arts.  The earnest and lively interest which he took in the state of public affairs, and the necessity which then existed for reforming the glaring abuses of the State, led him to speak out his mind freely on the subject.  Edinburgh was then under the reign of the Dundases; and scarcely anybody dared to mutter his objections to anything perpetrated by the \\\"powers that be.\\\"  The city was then a much smaller place than it is now.  There was more gossip, and perhaps more espionage, among the better classes, who were few in number.  At all events, my father's frank opinions on political subjects began to be known.  He attended Fox dinners.  He was intimate with men of known reforming views.  All this was made the subject of general talk. Accordingly, my father received many hints from aristocratic and wealthy personages, that \\\"if this went on any longer they would withdraw from him their employment.\\\"  My father did not alter his course; it was right and honest.  But he suffered nevertheless. His income from portrait painting fell off rapidly.\\n\\nAt length he devoted himself to landscape painting.  It was a freer and more enjoyable life.  Instead of painting the faces of those who were perhaps without character or attractiveness, he painted the fresh and ever-beautiful face of nature.  The field of his employment in this respect was almost inexhaustible.  His artistic talent in this delightful branch of art was in the highest sense congenial to his mind and feelings; and in course of time the results of his new field of occupation proved thoroughly satisfactory.  In fact, men of the highest rank with justice entitled him the \\\"Father of landscape painting in Scotland.\\\"\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  No.  47 York Place, Edinburgh\\n\\nAt the same time, when changing his branch of art, he opened a class in his own house forgiving practical instruction in the art of landscape painting.  He removed his house and studio from St. James's Square to No. 47 York Place.  There was at the upper part of this house a noble and commodious room.  There he held his class.  The house was his own, and was built after his own designs.  A splendid prospect was seen from the upper windows; and especially from the Belvidere, which he had constructed on the summit of the roof.  The view extended from Stirling in the west to the Bass Rock in the east.  In fine summer evenings the sun was often seen setting behind Ben Lomond and the more conspicuous of the Perthshire mountains.\\n\\nMy father did not confine himself to landscape painting, or to the instruction of his classes.  He was an all-round man.  He had something of the Universal about him.  He was a painter, an architect, and a mechanic.  Above all, he possessed a powerful store of common sense. Of course, I am naturally a partial judge of my father's character; but this I may say, that during my experience of over seventy years I have never known a more incessantly industrious man.  His hand and mind were always at work from morn till night.  During the time that he was losing his business in portrait painting, he set to work and painted scenery for the theatres.  The late David Roberts--himself a scene painter of the highest character--said that his style was founded upon that of Nasmyth.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... David Roberts, R,A., in his Autobiography, gives the following recollections of Alexander Nasmyth: -- \\\"In 1819 I commenced my career as principal scene painter in the Theatre Royal, Glasgow.  This theatre was immense in its size and appointments--in magnitude exceeding Drury Lane and Covent Garden. The stock scenery had been painted by Alexander Nasmyth, and consisted of a series of pictures far surpassing anything of the kind I had ever seen.  These included chambers, palaces, streets, landscapes, and forest scenery.  One, I remember particularly, was the outside of a Norman castle, and another of a cottage charmingly painted, and of which I have a sketch.  But the act scene, which was a view on the Clyde looking towards the Highland mountains with Dumbarton Castle in the middle distance, was such a combination of magnificent scenery, so wonderfully painted, that it excited universal admiration.  These productions I studied incessantly; and on them my style, if I have any, was originally founded.\\\"  ...\\\\]\\n\\nStanfield was another of his friends.  On one occasion Stanfield showed him his sketch-book, observing that he wished to form a style of his own.  \\\"Young man,\\\" said Nasmyth, \\\"there's but one style an artist should endeavour to attain, and that is the style of nature; the nearer you can get to that the better.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639288307,\"title\":\"\\nTo return to my father's profession as a portrait painter.
