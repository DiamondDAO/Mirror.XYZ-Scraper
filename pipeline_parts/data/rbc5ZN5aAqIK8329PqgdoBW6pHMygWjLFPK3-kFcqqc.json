"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is a summer afternoon, the sun hanging in the sky is still mercilessly radiating heat.In order to meet the coming ceremony of victory, on the dock, numerous guards wearing bright red armor have surrounded the front of the port no.1 pier.\\n\\nA hundred paces beyond the quay, the soldiers of the embattled imperial police were straining themselves to the limit.Many of their clothes were torn, their shiny epaulettes ripped off, their swagger hats ripped off, even their boots trampled off.\\n\\nTo the dismay of the 1, 000 police soldiers assigned to maintain order outside the port, they faced a crowd of more than 50, 000 enthusiastic citizens of the imperial capital.\\n\\nEnthusiastic onlookers prepared flowers, cheers, applause - and, of course, many girls were even prepared to offer kisses and even their virginity.In the midst of such emotional turmoil, a thousand security men felt like a broken ship in the middle of a vast ocean, ready to be capsized.\\n\\nAt the moment they envied the guards standing within the dock cordon, who could easily line up and display the brightest armour and weapons they had just been given, without fear of being snapped in the face by some fanatical citizen the next moment.\\n\\nFor this grand triumphal event, the length of the Lancang Grand Canal from the imperial capital was doubled under the order of the great Emperor Augustine VI!It cost the empire ten thousand river workers for six months, and nearly three million ducats from the empire's Treasury.\\n\\nAnd pay these costs, the purpose is just to let the empire \\\"X expeditions fleet\\\" flagship \\\"Dandong\\\" can smoothly through the canal to the east port outside the imperial capital, accept the cheers of the people, in order to demonstrate the empire's powerful force.\\n\\nNo one cares if a display of status is worth paying the price.\\n\\nFor the former chancellor of the Exchequer, who had first raised strong objections, had been sent straight back to his old home by the angry Emperor.The chancellor's only choice was how to squeeze as much money as possible out of the empire's coffers to satisfy the \\\"old man of great achievement\\\".\\n\\nOf course, the term \\\"jolly old man\\\" can only be buried deep in the Chancellor's heart, deep, deep...\\n\\nAs the afternoon sun beat down on the canal's wide surface and the first sails took shape in the distance, the crowd roared uncontrollably.\\n\\nAs the river on the two hundred paces of the huge battleship slowly approached the harbor, the battleship's majestic and mighty outline shocked all the citizens of the imperial capital who came to watch.\\n\\nThe flagship of the empire's sixth expeditionary fleet, \\\"Dandong\\\", the pride of the Imperial Navy, the largest ship in the history of the Imperial Navy.The ship had been thoroughly repainted and refurbished for the grand welcome, painted a forbidding black, and with wave after wave of cheering, the Dandong approached the harbor like a giant black monster, a huge briar-flower flag flying from her mast.\\n\\nWhen the anchor dropped, tens of thousands of citizens in the harbor were already boiling, hats were thrown into the air, shoes were trampled off, and legs were crushed.And the poor vigilante had to shrink the cordon as much as he could, and shrink it further...\\n\\nLord Raymond, commander of the Imperial Expeditionary Fleet, stood on forecastle Hill, looking impassively at the cheering crowds in the harbor.\\n\\nAt thirty-nine, the first class general of the Empire, the Count of the Empire, was now in his best dress, covered in light armour, his scarlet cloak rustling behind him, and wearing on his chest two MEDALS from his two previous expeditions.And there was no doubt that this triumph would win him the count's eyes were distracted, and his eyes were not fixed on the cheering crowds in the harbour, but on closer examination the count's brow seemed vaguely wrinkled and impatient.\",\"timestamp\":1634809542,\"title\":\"The earl's son\"},\"digest\":\"UNol_TVgYx8IZrBWb3xJ06rdU2nvKji2xSxI2L2Yz5E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD8e626daF9141784e39631F1b9EFcFe4f2A0524a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wDTCQov4LCO5MLrdL9qq2QgXaWFESg-7bK3TGpqkiCo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"88PBn-wRrx9TbnEN6aRpC6Ps3C5CA1mjwYwYJTd2THw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"h9ASDImfm80NfR_CkZJZhAmPDdBUFjXIc3NxkVe1sdKA8g2uaWGWoIq_ci56F3x_IyuErahNQVhQWRkgsyRrRA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4e535a9bdc604dfa3de091d0e7f74a2d42ce16d0476e7501c02fa8de02d586516f634d540e3b7204d5925fc3352abeaa17e68a7e3ea78aadc0f74b5d2fdbaae11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wDTCQov4LCO5MLrdL9qq2QgXaWFESg-7bK3TGpqkiCo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"88PBn-wRrx9TbnEN6aRpC6Ps3C5CA1mjwYwYJTd2THw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UNol_TVgYx8IZrBWb3xJ06rdU2nvKji2xSxI2L2Yz5E\"}"
