"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Museum of Crypto Art, or MoCA, is a virtual art gallery founded by longtime friends and investors Pablo Rodriguez-Fraile and Colborn Bell and designed by Desiree Casoni. It was launched in April 2020 within Somnium Space, a virtual space built on the Ethereum blockchain. MoCA displays a large collection of tokenized art that the museumâ€™s collectors have purchased as nonfungible tokens.\\n\\nBefore founding the museum, Rodriguez-Fraile and Bell were crypto and blockchain investors, becoming involved with Ethereum early on, as well as projects such as Algorand and Hashgraph. They first were exposed to NFTs through CryptoKitties but understood their true potential when they realized virtual land and crypto art could be connected.\",\"timestamp\":1639032129,\"title\":\"We feel this is a beautiful and wonderful\"},\"digest\":\"I59M9wAOmc9aZT_0i0vO90j5YZYqyMxrnSjxbdBWW4w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbFB7274590157C4aAAdd7870A01fBEEfdbfC268b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TN34qtJcLluBmagRFvapOo13xBg_XJSWofKH3PvqHbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ruGD1uyf0a068pBE6h4R9haLR4Rjqowa-bMVKGP8BvU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FQBlZDvJilGl4gaNUWkJe1T5laH2_Ub9l-LIaKm8Hcnn_1qwBE9pUnG1ajSVvlLUFv-3ggxTS2oyksvuGDaVxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x11cb53ca9a0c63af31ebc5a5056598a36ac0b060a6f38ae0520ee062d2cb93874ec84fb04f3bf8c274a1282c771a230452029dfb70afa657fbcd49173c764a671b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TN34qtJcLluBmagRFvapOo13xBg_XJSWofKH3PvqHbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ruGD1uyf0a068pBE6h4R9haLR4Rjqowa-bMVKGP8BvU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"I59M9wAOmc9aZT_0i0vO90j5YZYqyMxrnSjxbdBWW4w\"}"
