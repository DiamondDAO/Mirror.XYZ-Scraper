But it is regrettable that instead of correcting its wrong decision, it chooses to stick to its current path by turning to the US and the EU for help, while pinning the label of the so-called \\\"economic coercion\\\" onto China. \\n  \\n In fact, the term of economic coercion is actually the best word to describe what the US has done in pursuit of its own interests and strategic goals. By wielding the big stick of economic sanctions against other countries and wantonly suppressing other countries' high-tech enterprises, the US has demonstrated to the world what economic coercion is. \\n  \\n By comparison, it is a distortion of the concept to pin the label of \\\"economic coercion\\\" onto China. Lithuania's provocation over the Taiwan question is mean and despicable. \\n  \\n Despite China's advance warning, Lithuania still decided to undermine China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and grossly interfered in China's internal affairs, to the detrimental of China's core interests, which is in violation of international law and basic norms of international relations. Under these circumstances, any decision China takes to defend its sovereignty is justified, and Lithuania needs to pay a price for its reckless provocation. \\n  \\n And it is absurd for Lithuania to assume that its \\\"independent foreign policy decisions\\\" can be based on undermining others' sovereignty. It is either stupid or malicious of the Lithuanian government to follow such a twisted and rogue logic when it comes to foreign relations. \\n  \\n Nevertheless, we have to say that there is a surprisingly naive side in those Lithuanian politicians, because they apparently still believe the US could replace China's role in the global supply chains. The US itself is now reeling from serious supply crisis and skyrocketing inflation, and may yet need China's help and coordination to get out its woes. It would be delusional for Lithuania to have any hope for substantive US support in terms of protecting its supply line. \\n  \\n We suggest China's relevant authorities make plans to remove Lithuania from the country's industrial supply chain to punish the Baltic nation for its flouting One-China principle and trampling on China's sovereignty. \\n \",\"timestamp\":1637936015,\"title\":\"China downgrades diplomatic mission in Lithuania to Charg√© D'affaires Office\"},\"digest\":\"vFQ9h6wWHkVd_97AZjP86z_sBsSFSFNi82TrWUmuAVQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x05B0084495e05ba689A4C3598f7B2F557fbFd660\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPNxFyjg10SfOXTIOfHl8Ox_0nWawcHi0j9hO6MmobY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ms_SYb2ZzNAXrjvNgvd_B_qRZMfBvCYYixxYmzgFtU8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dlutvOosPAbfMkWZAmWYslcDpcT0hd3YxTU2JPTcibC8jkG_DxW7HMDy6xR-Sewbh4pCvIiUnRw4FKZ4mE7bBg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1911afd1fc6223fa9fcdd251d4a74b13dc1145cd7c663eba1ce9fb0fda00c68d7d5baa52991c735d048385f43ac2e739315c46c9def245e11aef60f8633eeb371c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPNxFyjg10SfOXTIOfHl8Ox_0nWawcHi0j9hO6MmobY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ms_SYb2ZzNAXrjvNgvd_B_qRZMfBvCYYixxYmzgFtU8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vFQ9h6wWHkVd_97AZjP86z_sBsSFSFNi82TrWUmuAVQ\"}"
