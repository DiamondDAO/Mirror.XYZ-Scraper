For example, actually owning your digital copy rather than just a license so you can sell it to another user's account. That's actually the future of digital gaming. What I'm against is how Ubisoft are doing it with in-game items,” they added.\\n\\n### Gamer backlash to NFTs\\n\\nThis is not the first time a major firm has been flamed for looking at, or launching into the world of NFTs. Cointelegraph reported last month that community messaging app Discord was forced to walk back its Ethereum-based [NFT integration plans](https://cointelegraph.com/news/discord-drops-ethereum-and-nft-integration-plans-after-backlash), after the gamer community bombarded CEO Jason Citron.\\n\\nCitron initially teased his firm’s plans via a screenshot of a beta feature showing [Ethereum NFT wallet support](https://cointelegraph.com/news/discord-community-splits-as-ceo-unveils-pre-released-ethereum-integration), however he was promptly hounded with thousands of comments calling on him to abandon the plans along with users threatening to cancel their paid Nitro subscriptions.\\n\\n***Reddit: [OpenSea walks back on IPO plan following community backlash](https://cointelegraph.com/news/opensea-walks-back-on-ipo-plan-following-community-backlash)***\\n\\nUnlike the case of Ubisoft, where the community appears to be peeved by what they assert is a cash grab, the crypto-skeptics on Discord believe NFTs are a Ponzi scheme and damage the environment due to the energy required to mine cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nCointelegraph has reached out to Ubisoft representatives for comment, and will update the story if they respond.\\n\\nDELIVERED EVERY MONDAY\",\"timestamp\":1639120192,\"title\":\"“I'm not entirely against the concept of using an NFT style system\"},\"digest\":\"f1Q5xwQpoiY7GJfSGydJ4wU-TFkOwEBw7uVHc5q9jQM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x84BBd884B158351c7c9F5F3EF066CB5d07BDD4f7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PU-Mgz-FZROYptIUYHBXmRMJmn7xqMa68dClD0uMHEs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"geWq8qwgQZ5ZKqPpZWzmwkkADaVyIVCeX9dTEpo_5Yw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qwEveQGlaQu9U7aeiTx55FLUn4LuaDfmkA-dFJdQoidrivePiWB3uvpS4IPTXrq9AXoS5NuFb7HCWtlUPx4SJQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x94a3a6104c34599945e3d7007693ed17b68e480fbc059405bfaa4f0c2dc1d29a0d688e82079f287f92253f3e4b40023aa241a1f5735571847e138f6061ecc3fb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PU-Mgz-FZROYptIUYHBXmRMJmn7xqMa68dClD0uMHEs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"geWq8qwgQZ5ZKqPpZWzmwkkADaVyIVCeX9dTEpo_5Yw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"f1Q5xwQpoiY7GJfSGydJ4wU-TFkOwEBw7uVHc5q9jQM\"}"
