(safe to say, my wallet is not happy) \\n  \\n This is where other blockchains (Layer 1s) have come in to fill the gap, each with their own pros/cons \\n  \\n Sol: Building the Nasdaq for blockchains - Speed and Low transaction fees, amount, above everything else \\n  \\n Avax: EVM compatible proof of stake chain, allowing apps built on Ethereum to be ported over directly \\n  \\n Ada: Proof of stake chain, built by co-founder of ETH to build across its initially design shortcomings \\n  \\n Near: With its unique consensus mechanism, Doomslug, they are trying to eliminate the shortcomings of Eth limitations - low transaction speeds, low throughput \\n  \\n Glmr: EVM compatible, POS chain, ad theoretically interoperable with other 99 para-chains on DOT \\n  \\n Eth 2.0 - and of course, the big boy, Eth 2.0, switching of Eth from proof of work to proof of stake consensus, and solving its scalability dilemma \\n  \\n Lots of different approaches for solving the smart-contract scaling problem  \\n  \\n In the end, all of these might turn out to be collaborative, and not competitive, unlike the Web2 world\",\"timestamp\":1642499047,\"title\":\"Welcome to the L1 Wars!\"},\"digest\":\"JooaSjHCZvvxkNPRNtJrQwFT5hK1XKFrslQmiDEwbC8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF41DF18b77bec4e196Ecf0178820313F9Fca3562\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9MDTNFKkmPt6C40sVJhdzb51qYUjH7pg1dj_3mO4pF8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7qf62ZqRAbEAYWPawgfq4oYkqHbt4oD0egU7ASP7p-8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VIKQtZpJ4OnHn0SlOmHTk81GnDEzKBMgP7vQrspNTd64rTV8NLbDN2qL_OetPWgYq-RflDmZ93CW5onVzYp5bw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfca35987db28220465f949e8414d396e911f842c8caa46dbdad7fad0118798ab7d26b8f7967ca9be532786093ace73c092ed916e94d8da872148d1a00a92891c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9MDTNFKkmPt6C40sVJhdzb51qYUjH7pg1dj_3mO4pF8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7qf62ZqRAbEAYWPawgfq4oYkqHbt4oD0egU7ASP7p-8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JooaSjHCZvvxkNPRNtJrQwFT5hK1XKFrslQmiDEwbC8\"}"
