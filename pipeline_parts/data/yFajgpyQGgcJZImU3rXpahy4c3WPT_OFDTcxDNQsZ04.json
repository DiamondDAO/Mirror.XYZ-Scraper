We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\\n\\nThe land & cabins are our hardware. Now we're starting to experiment with [on-chain governance software](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4).\\n\\nWe will set up a DAO to manage the crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\\n\\n## CabinDAO\\n\\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The cabins in Texas have four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\\n\\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO.\\n\\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of Creator Coop. We didn't go into our stay intending to make this—the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. Everyone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to build something much bigger.  We hope this residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFAQs\\nWho is eligible for a residency?\\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\\nHow will the money be spent?\\nWe are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week for room and board, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins).\\nWhat happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\\nThe DAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else the DAO decides to grant them to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621901271,\"title\":\"$CABIN: creator residency crowdfund\",\"publication\":\"creators\"},\"digest\":\"t-EWNSCM63E8gkA3g6aNU_jO46awW03T5J6RTdYka4U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4BQqEBrrhD6AerFcB8x8ukf95hJ0YgTqIkr15CsIoeQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZRXWcxXnsGnG_9NyA8ijCvQkQUBMgv5phqGH6bs-2FE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"yxQcedMofT35NTSogsnr8XpBUK9waw7bOuXJIHpAJ4vjlU1EuvOS84hdkIPeT4d-bBD8ggOyXtpQFTsDuLU56w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x966d02b74c365d3b5ca2c2fb1b2f00cfabe0ad89f82ae4c0236c6ead91e646af11aa170e25abc4695140730fef4e4cc6f2824bf9ae3c7b75565c31df3003c6611b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on creators.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"4BQqEBrrhD6AerFcB8x8ukf95hJ0YgTqIkr15CsIoeQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZRXWcxXnsGnG_9NyA8ijCvQkQUBMgv5phqGH6bs-2FE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bq669jDh2Rra9sE0qhYv0zYrn-rZRvtGJM1mspQ3Ok8\"}"
