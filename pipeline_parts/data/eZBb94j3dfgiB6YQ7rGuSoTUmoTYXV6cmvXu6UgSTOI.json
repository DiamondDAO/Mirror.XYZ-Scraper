I read. I read a lot. But not books. Not at all.\\n\\nI can’t remember where I first came across Bitcoin. Must have been blogs. Being a little bit of a geek, it immediately got my interest. I remember attempting to mine them with a standard out-of-the-box pc. I never got anywhere. I kind of lost interest. What was the value for each Bitcoin back then? In the low $80’s.\\n\\nFast forward a few months. Now Bitcoin wasn’t just talked about on obscure blogs and weird sites. Bitcoin was on the news. The price at this point? $400 USD.\\n\\nThen, $600, then $800, then $1000, and then it went above the price of 1 oz of gold.\\n\\nYes. Bitcoin was worth more than one ounce of pure gold.\\n\\nBitcoiners rejoiced everywhere.\\n\\n…Then… the long dry spell.\\n\\nMost people lost interest. Only the hardcore supporters and random citizens like myself kept on keeping on. I saved a few coins from the early rally. I sold most but kep a handful. I watch the value of my coins go from $400 to high $1050 and then to $189 in a very slowly and controlled pace.\\n\\nI couldn’t complaint. Bitcoin had been good to me.\\n\\nSo I kept on keeping on.\\n\\nToday, 1 single Bitcoin is worth $435 USD. The rally has been on for a few weeks now and it doesn’t seem like it wants to stop.\\n\\nBack in October I Tweeted:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/DeFiDaniel/status/650841136337133568?s=20](https://twitter.com/DeFiDaniel/status/650841136337133568?s=20)\\n\\nThe value then was $240. That’s a really neat 80% ROI. And it seems like it wants to touch top at $500. If this one holds, I believe we could test all time highs at $1050 or so.\\n\\nSo, I keep on keeping on with Bitcoin.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/DeFiDaniel/status/675308635266744320?s=20](https://twitter.com/DeFiDaniel/status/675308635266744320?s=20)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638148549,\"title\":\"Bitcoin - The Next Great Rally (2015)\"},\"digest\":\"uT1BoSO7KUzs62rjGN64Tp8CV1NMzinHa9A_ouIphz0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9268D3DA153a596B2c360d2A47dE8CBBE82014aD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7BViYxaiV7aWz7Y7kdwR4vljqPMmyXFufENNTXV4cIc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l-Za3DuhpV7AYJ4Ul-rnjkzDWak2cDFOJbJbolQUNQE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"v4n24ZrTOOSp2N2vqIsei25Gcu4wHoEVXsgAzJHkfkKKlmrZOkd0G8B3z2W_Lxs6g5EeAf9BrRA0FcGDOOpWEA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc1edd90ec41cd96853d254d0e5059c8e54b6dfa736d2e309537c2dc3fb5c2f120da3d339ba853f33f68c688f01fbd86d4681cd31bab5004558f6fee05f949ba71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7BViYxaiV7aWz7Y7kdwR4vljqPMmyXFufENNTXV4cIc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l-Za3DuhpV7AYJ4Ul-rnjkzDWak2cDFOJbJbolQUNQE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"uT1BoSO7KUzs62rjGN64Tp8CV1NMzinHa9A_ouIphz0\"}"
