Just like there’s a separation between church and state, there should be a separation between money and state.\\n\\n**Central banks are extensions out of** nation-states that are controlled by people who have their own interests. Everything that affects our finances is ultimately dictated by a small group of people behind curtains.\\n\\n**Centillion effect and inflation disproportionately put money into already rich hands** — the people and businesses who are approximate to the federal reserve. People who already have assets watch their value constantly go up aka asset inflation. Who are the primary owners of assets?

Removing them is an opportunity to distribute more wealth.\\n\\n**Crypto offers solutions to these problems by communicating value** through protocols, for example, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. It’s through inherently neutral protocols, or code, that they can offer a fairer (albeit currently volatile) system for everyone.\\n\\n**Web3 aims to replicate the current financial system in a way that’s more credibly neutral, open, accessible, verifiable, and much more powerful.** Crypto’s strongest attribute? It makes social coordination easier! It facilitates human collaboration and is a human coordination technology.\\n\\n**Personal sovereignty over your finances!** At the end of the day, you should be given the option to be in 100% control over the storing and management of your wealth.
