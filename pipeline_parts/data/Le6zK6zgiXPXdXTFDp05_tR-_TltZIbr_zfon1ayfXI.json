"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Mary was the middle one. She was smaller than Jane, but she was bigger than Linda. Mary did things like pushing the stroller when she and Mother took Linda for a walk, and digging in the sandbox, and giving the poppy his breakfast when Mother was too busy. Mary had things like being told she did a very good job dressing herself, and having stories read to her―― sitting close to Mother. Also, Mary had had rides on Daddy's back when he acted like a bear, or a camel, or a pony. Those were not things for Linda because she was too little. They were not for Jane, either. She was too big. They were all things just for Mary, no longer little like Linda, and not yet big like Jane.\",\"timestamp\":1639034196,\"title\":\"The Middle One\"},\"digest\":\"rrcgoSoB7dJvJXYibUb4wDeRz4AX5edRXF0Vsw3H4Zg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6C9069413411bE59b19EfC3229eD68C5EcF1544F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bpf-pDLQ_t3Dsw9FiYyg_P7Gb-f-jP0qtaZhxstxbws\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7gjT7332ChGIksqV5MuRWcs7pCsiVGz5W4dxbdVtPtw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RqNnrtDv4FFn3NQTNp4vj8_6TwrtJoaLTIVu8CHT8YYJXExC-kh_vfYj5I4FIxlLee0opjgTtI3kQJSuelcmCQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8897db7e4345aca13381cada39f5e79d6b19c905f306bcaee7e94b44181de1bd1109b5af54812d11660d74b19298bab686a53adf95a6280dcb995a44bab287aa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bpf-pDLQ_t3Dsw9FiYyg_P7Gb-f-jP0qtaZhxstxbws\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7gjT7332ChGIksqV5MuRWcs7pCsiVGz5W4dxbdVtPtw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rrcgoSoB7dJvJXYibUb4wDeRz4AX5edRXF0Vsw3H4Zg\"}"
