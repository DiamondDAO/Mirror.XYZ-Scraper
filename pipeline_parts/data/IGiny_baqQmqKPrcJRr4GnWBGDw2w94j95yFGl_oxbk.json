"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"# MOWIES\\n\\nMowies is a marketplace for content creators that provides the best tools for creators to share, distribute and monetize their work directly with their audiences. Rather than be limited by what social platforms offer creators, Mowies tools allow creators to monetize in new ways and at an average of 40x more than with traditional channels. Their beta has organically reached creators from 70 countries and led to 3,300 creations, 100,000 transactions, and 98% retention on the platform.\\n\\nMowies founders (Google Launchpad and Techstars Alumni) are serial entrepreneurs with experience in media, communications, digital marketing, and fintech.\\n\\nWe are launching Creatures of Mass Creation to strengthen our community and with it, build the tools of tomorrow for creators and creative lovers.\\n\\nWe believe that decentralization is the path to creative abundance, freedom, and equality and that's why we decided to bet strongly on it.\\n\\nMowies presents\\n\\n# CREATURES OF MASS CREATION\\n\\n# INTRODUCTION\\n\\nThere are invisible forces moving the strings of our universe, and many others. For years we have called them Gods, ghosts, entities, angels and demons, Pokemons, etc.\\n\\nThey have inspired creation and love, but also destruction and war.\\n\\nMany deny it, others speculate, few know.\\n\\nToday, they manifest and reveal themselves as the Creatures of mass creation, forces of love, creation, and destruction that have come to us to help us reach our full creative potential, our GOD level as humans, and with that, help them on their quest.\\n\\n# WHO ARE THE CREATURES\\n\\nThe Creatures are beings that represent creation. They are 5th-dimensional beings in charge of experimenting with the creation of universes and their laws.\\n\\nThey learn and survive off of creative energy and come to each of the universes manifesting themselves in different shapes and forms, sometimes, in ours, even as humans.\\n\\nTheir main component in the creative energy process is love.\\n\\nTheir dream is to reach enlightenment and become GODS by reaching the maximum level of Creative energy in the multiverse. They dream of this “moment” and they call it The Transmutation. Where they become THE ONES and merge with the one and only cosmic entity.\\n\\nIn our universe, time, and era, they hide and operate behind the scenes. They are the inspiration and motivation behind creators. They are the passion and drive that push creativity forward on our planet.\\n\\nDuring our time they have been called muses, inspirational guidances, ghosts, angels, serendipity. They have been seen in visions, altered states of consciousness, flow states of mind… They have been here since they created our universe, playing and experimenting. Even though they can’t intervene directly, but they can create conditions, visions, alter reality (in within the laws of the multiverse), etc.\\n\\nBut they face adversity. In the creature’s trials, to become Gods, they have to face a force of annulment. A power that just kills and cancels energy as it is dissipates it so thin that the universal beings can´t harness this energy anymore. In some universes, fear is the null force. These are the Nulls.\\n\\nIn our universe, they are also present.\\n\\n# Creatures CMC\\n\\nFive beings have taken the form of millions of creatures.\\n\\n# Mousai: Inspiration\\n\\n**POWERS** Mind control, reality shifting\\n\\n**Favorite ART** Writing, poetry\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0WnGX0sZenWFFsg5M6W9J.jpg?height=3001&width=3001)\\n\\n# Eri: Love\\n\\n**POWERS** Nature’s blessing\\n\\n**Favorite ART** Dance\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UXG8GdmpoI6-Ypf_ykBFz.jpg?height=3000&width=3001)\\n\\n# Kapi: Passion\\n\\n**POWERS** Telekinesis\\n\\n**Favorite ART** Music\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/El7fdDxNNTbi75o4gqZZB.jpg?height=3000&width=3001)\\n\\nHelic: Flow\\n\\n**POWERS** Elements control, depending on the region the manifest, they can control, earth, fire, water, and wind.\\n\\n**Favorite ART** Coding\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7Imh5HZbWClGsOl2JIBbk.jpg?height=3000&width=3001)\\n\\n# Char: Kindness\\n\\n**POWERS** Healing\\n\\n**Favorite ART** Painting\\n\\nEach one of them assumed a basic form with infinite variations.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DqvdCdFUXcVkIMi7lNff4.jpg?height=3001&width=3001)\\n\\n# THE Null\\n\\nOne being with infinite variations.\\n\\nBut like a virus, it travels from mind to mind, through families, societies, and others, infecting us all. Its form it’s represented on each mind it infects. It uses fear as the main force of annulment.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pShduKDdTZK9zwKZQkXKL.jpg?height=3001&width=3001)\\n\\n# CREATURES AND NULL´s Traits and characteristics\\n\\nEvery Creature in this world have different characteristics or Traits\\n\\n**By Dice ROLL**\\n\\n**Constitution:** Physical resistance and endurance.
