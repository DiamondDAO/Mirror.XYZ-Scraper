"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Ha! that's it! you may well ask that! Those fellows down there\\n\\nhaven't any Grand Livre nor any Bank of France. So I was forced to\\n\\ncarry off my windfalls in a felucca, which was captured by the Turkish\\n\\nHigh-Admiral himself. Such as you see me here to-day, I came very near\\n\\nbeing impaled at Smyrna. Indeed, if it hadn't been for Monsieur de\\n\\nRiviere, our ambassador, who was there, they'd have taken me for an\\n\\naccomplice of Ali pacha. I saved my head, but, to tell the honest\\n\\ntruth, all the rest, the ten thousand talari, the thousand gold\\n\\npieces, and the fine weapons, were all, yes all, drunk up by the\\n\\nthirsty treasury of the Turkish admiral. My position was the more\\n\\nperilous because that very admiral happened to be Chosrew pacha. After\\n\\nI routed him, the fellow had managed to obtain a position which is\\n\\nequal to that of our Admiral of the Fleet--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I thought he was in the cavalry?\\\" said Pere Leger, who had\\n\\nfollowed the narrative with the deepest attention.\\n\\n\\\"Dear me! how little the East is understood in the French provinces!\\\"\\n\\ncried Georges. \\\"Monsieur, I'll explain the Turks to you. You are a\\n\\nfarmer; the Padishah (that's the Sultan) makes you a marshal; if you\\n\\ndon't fulfil your functions to his satisfaction, so much the worse for\\n\\nyou, he cuts your head off; that's his way of dismissing his\\n\\nfunctionaries. A gardener is made a prefect; and the prime minister\\n\\ncomes down to be a foot-boy. The Ottomans have no system of promotion\\n\\nand no hierarchy. From a cavalry officer Chosrew simply became a naval\\n\\nofficer. Sultan Mahmoud ordered him to capture Ali by sea; and he did\\n\\nget hold of him, assisted by those beggarly English--who put their paw\\n\\non most of the treasure. This Chosrew, who had not forgotten the\\n\\nriding-lesson I gave him, recognized me. You understand, my goose was\\n\\ncooked, oh, brown! when it suddenly came into my head to claim\\n\\nprotection as a Frenchman and a troubadour from Monsieur de Riviere.\\n\\nThe ambassador, enchanted to find something to show him off, demanded\\n\\nthat I should be set at liberty. The Turks have one good trait in\\n\\ntheir nature; they are as willing to let you go as they are to cut\\n\\nyour head off; they are indifferent to everything. The French consul,\\n\\ncharming fellow, friend of Chosrew, made him give back two thousand of\\n\\nthe talari, and, consequently, his name is, as I may say, graven on my\\n\\nheart--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What was his name?\\\" asked Monsieur de Serizy; and a look of some\\n\\nsurprise passed over his face as Georges named, correctly, one of our\\n\\nmost distinguished consul-generals who happened at that time to be\\n\\nstationed at Smyrna.\\n\\n\\\"I assisted,\\\" added Georges, \\\"at the execution of the Governor of\\n\\nSmyrna, whom the Sultan had ordered Chosrew to put to death. It was\\n\\none of the most curious things I ever saw, though I've seen many,--\\n\\nI'll tell you about it when we stop for breakfast. From Smyrna I\\n\\ncrossed to Spain, hearing there was a revolution there. I went\\n\\nstraight to Mina, who appointed me as his aide-de-camp with the rank\\n\\nof colonel. I fought for the constitutional cause, which will\\n\\ncertainly be defeated when we enter Spain--as we undoubtedly shall,\\n\\nsome of these days--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You, a French soldier!\\\" said the count, sternly. \\\"You show\\n\\nextraordinary confidence in the discretion of those who are listening\\n\\nto you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But there are no spies here,\\\" said Georges.\\n\\n\\\"Are you aware, Colonel Georges,\\\" continued the count, \\\"that the Court\\n\\nof Peers is at this very time inquiring into a conspiracy which has\\n\\nmade the government extremely severe in its treatment of French\\n\\nsoldiers who bear arms against France, and who deal in foreign\\n\\nintrigues for the purpose of overthrowing our legitimate sovereigns.\\\"\\n\\nOn hearing this stern admonition the painter turned red to his ears\\n\\nand looked at Mistigris, who seemed dumfounded.\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Pere Leger, \\\"what next?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If,\\\" continued the count, \\\"I were a magistrate, it would be my duty\\n\\nto order the gendarmes at Pierrefitte to arrest the aide-de-camp of\\n\\nMina, and to summon all present in this vehicle to testify to his\\n\\nwords.\\\"\\n\\nThis speech stopped Georges' narrative all the more surely, because at\\n\\nthis moment the coucou reached the guard-house of a brigade of\\n\\ngendarmerie,--the white flag floating, as the orthodox saying is, upon\\n\\nthe breeze.\\n\\n\\\"You have too many decorations to do such a dastardly thing,\\\" said\\n\\nOscar.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind; we'll catch up with him soon,\\\" whispered Georges in the\\n\\nlad's ear.\\n\\n\\\"Colonel,\\\" cried Leger, who was a good deal disturbed by the count's\\n\\noutburst, and wanted to change the conversation, \\\"in all these\\n\\ncountries where you have been, what sort of farming do they do? How do\\n\\nthey vary the crops?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, in the first place, my good fellow, you must understand, they\\n\\nare too busy cropping off each others' heads to think much of cropping\\n\\nthe ground.\\\"\\n\\nThe count couldn't help smiling; and that smile reassured the\\n\\nnarrator.\\n\\n\\\"They have a way of cultivating which you will think very queer. They\\n\\ndon't cultivate at all; that's their style of farming. The Turks and\\n\\nthe Greeks, they eat onions or rise. They get opium from poppies, and\\n\\nit gives them a fine revenue. Then they have tobacco, which grows of\\n\\nitself, famous latakiah! and dates! and all kinds of sweet things that\\n\\ndon't need cultivation. It is a country full of resources and\\n\\ncommerce. They make fine rugs at Smyrna, and not dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" persisted Leger, \\\"if the rugs are made of wool they must come\\n\\nfrom sheep; and to have sheep you must have fields, farms, culture--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, there may be something of that sort,\\\" replied Georges. \\\"But\\n\\ntheir chief crop, rice, grows in the water. As for me, I have only\\n\\nbeen along the coasts and seen the parts that are devastated by war.\\n\\nBesides, I have the deepest aversion to statistics.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How about the taxes?\\\" asked the farmer.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! the taxes are heavy; they take all a man has, and leave him the\\n\\nrest. The pacha of Egypt was so struck with the advantages of that\\n\\nsystem, that, when I came away he was on the point of organizing his\\n\\nown administration on that footing--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But,\\\" said Leger, who no longer understood a single word, \\\"how?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How?\\\" said Georges. \\\"Why, agents go round and take all the harvests,\\n\\nand leave the fellahs just enough to live on. That's a system that\\n\\ndoes away with stamped papers and bureaucracy, the curse of France,\\n\\nhein?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"By virtue of what right?\\\" said Leger.\\n\\n\\\"Right? why it is a land of despotism. They haven't any rights. Don't\\n\\nyou know the fine definition Montesquieu gives of despotism. 'Like the\\n\\nsavage, it cuts down the tree to gather the fruits.' They don't tax,\\n\\nthey take everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And that's what our rulers are trying to bring us to. 'Tax vobiscum,'\\n\\n\\\\--no, thank you!\\\" said Mistigris.\\n\\n\\\"But that is what we ARE coming to,\\\" said the count. \\\"Therefore, those\\n\\nwho own land will do well to sell it. Monsieur Schinner must have seen\\n\\nhow things are tending in Italy, where the taxes are enormous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Corpo di Bacco! the Pope is laying it on heavily,\\\" replied Schinner.\\n\\n\\\"But the people are used to it. Besides, Italians are so good-natured\\n\\nthat if you let 'em murder a few travellers along the highways they're\\n\\ncontented.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1637316148,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"But what did you do with your treasures?\\\" asked farmer Leger.\"},\"digest\":\"YkFOV5aVDintgleUDqv-yESdYW_lM3zWjYJ5pYRM8D0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x368119602f169B8146fb749c112EF9CC81197C53\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7cc1NIsugsGc49-dKPhTV_wqjIpZ9rCgJvAM4raQe8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hqh-DCfkf-N6Eap0GVSoDLDz7JFUAgt4jIPk3HOiWqs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vW5syYq7qY5-_oE-4thzRVwWGflwWQAcWfoZSQqQdi4TGEAmjRGUCB0m76ZydKNIhUL1rMrejLP93aYwOHj8mQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa410e8bfe743fe185754154c6985ff33bd77376c8f1018f9b67bb646a232d7d2362c474173f27231ee7d5822a33b04d4d30bb3df38479aecabbff0480ae1bd871c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7cc1NIsugsGc49-dKPhTV_wqjIpZ9rCgJvAM4raQe8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"hqh-DCfkf-N6Eap0GVSoDLDz7JFUAgt4jIPk3HOiWqs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YkFOV5aVDintgleUDqv-yESdYW_lM3zWjYJ5pYRM8D0\"}"
