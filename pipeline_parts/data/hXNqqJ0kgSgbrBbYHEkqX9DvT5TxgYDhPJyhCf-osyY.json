"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## A black market is flourishing for “verified” accounts on major exchanges including Coinbase Pro and Binance US, a CoinDesk investigation found..\\n\\nFor law-abiding cryptocurrency users, getting verified to trade on an exchange is a painstaking process. They must give out a wealth of personal data, including their home addresses, scans of government-issued ID, and photo or video selfies.\\n\\nFor criminals, it’s easier. They can pay as little as $150 on the black market for a ready-to-use, verified account in someone else’s name at Coinbase Pro, Binance US, Kraken or numerous other exchanges, a CoinDesk investigation found.\\n\\nTo be clear: “verified” in this context does not mean legitimate. Underground vendors create these accounts with other people’s identities or under made-up names, tricking the exchanges into verifying them as valid users. They then advertise these verified accounts for sale on internet forums and on Telegram.\\n\\nBesides crypto exchanges, the vendors also offer fraudulently created accounts for use with mainstream payment providers such as Square’s Cash App and Transferwise.\\n\\n“We are producing from 1,500 to 2,000 synthetic verified accounts each month,” an operator of one such service told CoinDesk in an interview via the Telegram messaging app.\\n\\nThis service has multiple employees and even “departments” within the business, said the person, who refused to give a name. And it has no shortage of competitors, CoinDesk’s investigation found.\\n\\nA CoinDesk reporter reviewed a sample of crypto and payment accounts that had been purchased from several black-market vendors. The exercise revealed these vendors are, in many cases, trafficking in sensitive information about people who likely have no idea their names are on the accounts.\\n\\nIt also showed how people who, for whatever reason, don’t want to expose their real identities or fear they wouldn’t be approved for an account can skirt the industry’s customer-vetting processes – at least, up to a point.\\n\\nWhile it’s difficult to gauge the size of this market – criminals don’t typically publicize their revenue, after all – it appears to be flourishing\",\"timestamp\":1634719949,\"title\":\"For $200, You Can Trade Crypto With a Fake ID\"},\"digest\":\"c5XNGE7QGIUyjhG8p6MKJV2ORsYAh0BzZPfghaQmDAQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9fEBE8Fef2023A1471822697F2EE016e30D61953\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qiohQYl3srCh3bNzWY5HC4mxtWQNVW7naDzrmUBto-k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"m_FHCmifR1qmIvyQjrmX_wo1u2IuC1a9XviB1BKoZPY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TmGncnSU-GBbDLN4rOSW3Fo3eJE4aYuLLFmOmjTPcejq2edboCeq6ARf6qbSbP4hJ1iWSMv2nlbMF8PpWI0oGw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xae59bdf1804d4027beead272487ebace8fc5ec874804ad86668b0c01e6f2d8b80867e4bc7d8ce8b89863622650ef7a459d5a936e055af356d42ec200638cabb81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qiohQYl3srCh3bNzWY5HC4mxtWQNVW7naDzrmUBto-k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"m_FHCmifR1qmIvyQjrmX_wo1u2IuC1a9XviB1BKoZPY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"c5XNGE7QGIUyjhG8p6MKJV2ORsYAh0BzZPfghaQmDAQ\"}"
