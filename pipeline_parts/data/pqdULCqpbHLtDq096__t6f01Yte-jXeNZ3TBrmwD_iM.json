"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Over the past few weeks, I have been doing a little dive into Web 3 and blockchain.  There has been some controversy with jack Dorsey, Elon Musk et al dissing on Web 3 and VCs in general.  And on the regulatory front there has been lots of comment from Gary Gensler and the senate hearing featuring crypto firms.  At the same time over 2021 the crypto market has gone berserk rising from approx 770 billion to 2.2 trillion (https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/ )  .To understand the crypto space, we need to break the crypto universe into its constituents.\\n\\n1. Money and Value - this is where most people attention seem to be.  For the purpose of our discussion I will ignore this as I believe that the jury is still out there in terms of adoption.  There are several crypto here which are in the top 100 such as BTC, BCH, LTC, Decred and Stablecoins such as UST, USDC, DAI etc.   It is possible that government themselves will issue Stablecoins and there is evidence that most of them are exploring the concept.  I am confident that in the next 1 year at least some major country will have its own CBDC ie Stablecoin.\\n2. Blockchain - think of blockchain as operating system for the decentralized web.  Blockchain should be evaluated based on security, speed and scalability.  None can manage all 3. It is a compromise that every  blockchain that gets issued is making. This chart below showcases the difference between the different blockchain and why some of them such as Solana, Terra and Avalanche have seen their token value explode as they race to move past Ethereum.  \\n\\n> Some important questions that still need to be answered: A.  Will there be 1 blockchain for all applications or are we going to have application specific blockchain ?  It is looking likely that we will have multiple blockchain including application specific blockchain such as flow for gaming.  In that case there will also need to be a bridge between blockchain to enable inter operability between blockchain. B. Some blockchain such as Polkadot are attempting to build a chain of chains.  Will be interesting to see how this plays out.  In the meantime the prices of these crypto token fluctuates as investor try to judge outcome of success for these varied attempt.  \\n\\n1. Web 3 - One of the big trends in blockchain has been VC money pouring into building a decentralized internet.  Paired with skepticism over Facebook, Google and Amazon stranglehold over the internet, the promise to build a decentralized web is what is capturing everyone interest.  Imagine service such as file storage (Filecoin and Arweave ), Distributed Networks (Helium ) and Domain Name (ENS ).  However most of these services are being built on top of ethereum and have significant VC funding.    Which is where Jack Dorsey tweet and the VC response comes together!  Enclosed is a link to a post describing the web 3 ecosystem from a technical perspective.  \\n\\n   [https://edgeandnode.com/blog/defining-the-web3-stack](https://edgeandnode.com/blog/defining-the-web3-stack)\\n\\n2. Metaverse - Facebook response to crypto has had two components.  The first one was to focus on payment via Novi / Libra which after several years seem to still be stuck in regulatory hell.  The new pivot has been to focus on the metaverse.  This make sense as Gaming and Social are probably where crypto adoption is much easier to get traction vs payments which is still highly regulated and attracts negative attention from government entities.  Facebook has a budget of $10 billon per year over next several years to build the meta verse.  Before we dive deeper into the meta verse it is important to understand better what is the meta verse.  The simplest explanation I have heard is that the Metaverse is essentially anything which is not real.  In that case anything we do on Facebook is essentially in the meta verse.  AR and VR are both areas where there is significant excitement in terms of building the meta verse.   Over the past year VCs have poured in over $26 billion into consumer crypto of which a large chunk is going into gaming and NFT.  The enthusiasm around meta verse is also not complete hype.  One of the big story of the year has been the rise of Axie Infinity which has seen it token rise from 30 million to over $7 billion.  That is largely based on an enormous increase in Axie audience and commensurate increase in gaming revenues.   Chis Dixon remarked in his podcast with Bankless cited below that almost every gaming company is now exploring the use of tokens and NFT as part of their future plans.    Expect to see a lot more blockchain game with tokens in 2023.  Another trend on the back of this success has been the concept pf Earn to Play or Rent to Play.  That is a completely new paradigm which need to be explored in a separate post.  Below is a good post on the metaverse from Lou Kerner who runs Crypto Monday on the metaverse which inspired my own writeup.  \\n\\n   [https://medium.com/metacollective/what-is-a-community-what-is-the-metaverse-8f227f315d64](https://medium.com/metacollective/what-is-a-community-what-is-the-metaverse-8f227f315d64)\\n\\n3. DAO  - is a crypto framework for organizing people and effort which is completely unique.  The high level explanation would be that is a cross between a guild and LLC.  There is a post from Bankless which does a great job on walking thru DAO.  <https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-launch-a-dao>. .  Wyoming is the first jurisdiction to legally allow for a DAO to be setup as an economic entity,  The jury is still out on the value of a DAO and if it works, 2022 will be the year the DAO hits mainstream.   One of the best use case for a DAO is as an investment entity and the best examples of DAO are Metacartel (investment DAO) and Flamingo DAO (Digital Art investment DAO).\\n4. DefI - if 2022 was the year of NFT, 2021 was the year of DeFi.  There are some really good use case in DeFi such as Decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap (uniswap.iorg ) and lending protocol ([Aave.com](http://Aave.com) ) .  Mark Cuban has an interesting tweet about the lending use case and how it is superior to the current financial syste.  <https://mobile.twitter.com/mcuban/status/1465002539603185668>. .   DeFi is complicated and heavily regulated.  \\n\\n***Some predictions for Crypto for 2022***\\n\\n 2022 will be year some mid size economies and China issue digital currencies ie Stablecoin.  This makes a tons of sense as they can track and trace all transactions on the blockchain.  All they need to is implement KYC on the wallets.  Some indications that Mexico and India are considering it.  China already has a pilot active for CBDC. \\n\\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/28/rbi-recommends-india-implement-basic-version-of-cbdc/](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/28/rbi-recommends-india-implement-basic-version-of-cbdc/)\\n\\n[https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/30/mexico-plans-to-issue-a-cbdc-by-2024-government-confirms/](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/30/mexico-plans-to-issue-a-cbdc-by-2024-government-confirms/)\\n\\n* 2022 will be the year we develop more clarity on which blockchains will dominate the ecosystem.  Ethereum Proof of stake ie ETH 2.0 should go live (no more energy wastage arguments).  Other application specific blockchain such as Flow / Tezos for NFT, Enjin, XTZ, Flow for gaming, Solana / Terra for finance, etc. The chart below clearly illustrates the blockchain trilemma.  \\n\\n![Blockchain Trilemma](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2T0XJPqQJElhzVAa3CNrI.png?height=1560&width=2748)\\n\\n[https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-the-blockchain-trilemma)\\n\\n* Gaming will be a big use case in Crypto.  One of the best podcast to understand is Chris Dixon(Partner at A16Z and with a 2.2 billion war chest in the form of his latest fund)  podcast with Bankless  <https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-90-5-mental-models-for-web3-chris>.  Mentions that every gaming company the firm talks to today is looking at incorporation NFT and token into the game.  That is because games already have some of these concepts incorporated into them except with the blockchain they become decentralized (ie user owned) and composable (capable of being incorporated into another game).  Therefore a NFT and reputation earned in 1 game can be transported into another game.  We may also see a world where games such as Zed run (a horse racing game) can be seen in a new metaverse such as Upland though they both are unique entities.  And that opportunity maybe driven not by the entities but by the users.\\n\\n\\n* 2022 will be the year where the onramps to crypto become easier.  It becomes much easier to move dollars and other currencies to crypto and for users to custody crypto without worrying about private keys and seed phrase.  Consider that in the last 9 months of this year 3 billion has been invested in companies which are essentially crypto exchanges, custody and staking services companies.  Many of these services promise to bolt onto your bank account and seamlessly allow you to invest your checking account, IRA etc in crypto.  This will significantly reduce the friction in crypto investing.\\n\\n\\n* Corporate Interest in Crypto will be an all time high. 2022 will be the year where corporates start getting involved in crypto.  The easiest use case is for brand and consumers companies to get involved with NFT.  We will see a lot more deals like Nike acqusition of  RTFKT. (<https://news.nike.com/news/nike-acquires-rtfkt>. ).  These are low risk opportunities to test the waters and combining digital with physical is a no brainer.  Imagine buying an expensive bottle of wine or scotch and getting a unique NFT to commemorate that along with a membership to a loyal club.  And talking of loyalty something like airmails is ideally suited for the blockchain (<https://fintechmagazine.com/digital-payments/flycoin-making-cryptocurrency-new-air-miles>. ).  Of course it is not something that smaller airlines would test out as they have the little to loose.  Apart from this I imagine we will see crypto use case in niche use case such as weather insurance. <https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/14/accuweather-taps-chainlink-to-explore-crop-insurance-and-more/>.\",\"timestamp\":1640929636,\"title\":\"Crypto and Web 3 - Understanding the ecosystem and prediction for 2022\"},\"digest\":\"4t35Kpe2neDeCo7MjeKAAnH-tbXegDvzBpcaJk5EaIU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x738027f2d60D05b3B136893fD9c97a75F737bB8e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uG-Jm7pJgCkAel9qyxSevkJ4fPYTS1MVVoFbN2s_DtY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d3tqK-JDvW-lh63C5TI68oTRPSMozfBl8jSm7rFBDKI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"zNyKAeK-7zOrIFP9lLd5G5F_x1vCkOsIHQv8CcIyTpcb0WMsyAristd5r8-byix0I3UniTh8LKA8EnELLHRymw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1ff43efab29b52c9035f48672f016ed217f838b3e1457c34f116c665adbe04ff0353d321e84b9a826d2d48b07cf5d5c4bb92c8e9dd5a79eacab281ab466bf4891b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uG-Jm7pJgCkAel9qyxSevkJ4fPYTS1MVVoFbN2s_DtY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"d3tqK-JDvW-lh63C5TI68oTRPSMozfBl8jSm7rFBDKI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4t35Kpe2neDeCo7MjeKAAnH-tbXegDvzBpcaJk5EaIU\"}"
