"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Democratic [Virginia gubernatorial](https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/virginia-governor-race) candidate Terry McAuliffe's repeated false statements about the number of coronavirus cases and hospitalizations in the state came to a head Tuesday as [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/26/terry-mcauliffe-keeps-inflating-coronavirus-numbers/) awarded him its worst possible falsehood rating of four Pinocchios. \\n\\n\\\"The pandemic will continue to be a serious policy challenge for the next Virginia governor but there’s no reason for McAuliffe to hype the numbers. He earns Four Pinocchios,\\\" wrote The Post's resident fact-checker, [Glenn Kessler](https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-fact-checker-glenn-kessler-biden-border-gotcha-question) after outlining each instance McAuliffe repeated the false figures. \\\"He offers wildly inflated figures for child hospitalizations, suggesting again that these were daily figures and claiming twice that these many children were in ICUs. Instead, he appears to be citing a figure for all of the children hospitalized with covid-19 in Virginia over the past 19 months — which is still inflated.\\\"\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris waves to the crowd along with Democratic gubernatorial candidate, former Virginia Gov.

Okay, we understand that, and so we passed on a fact check. But then his tongue kept slipping.\\\"\\n\\n**[MCAULIFFE GETS ‘AGITATED’ WHEN ASKED ABOUT PANICKING CAMPAIGN, EFFORTS TO TIE YOUNKGIN TO TRUMP: REPORT](https://www.foxnews.com/media/mcauliffe-gets-agitated-when-asked-panicking-campaign)**\\n\\nKessler wrote that The Post first became interested in McAuliffe's numbers on Sep. 28 when he claimed, during the gubernatorial debate against Republican businessman [Glenn Youngkin](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/glenn-youngkin-critical-race-theory-ban-elected-virginia-governor), that there were 8,000 new coronavirus cases in Virginia the previous day. He then repeated the claim the following day, and again on Oct. 7. during a radio interview. \\n\\nVirginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate and former Gov.

On Sept. 27, there were fewer than 2,000 confirmed cases,\\\" he wrote, before adding that the McAuliffe campaign claimed he was speaking about combined weekend numbers between Friday morning and Monday morning and that he misspoke when he also said there were more than 1,100 children in intensive care unit beds at the time.\\n\\nMcAuliffe wasn't even close, as the Post noted that for the week ending on Oct. 2, the \\\"number of children in hospitals, not necessarily in intensive care, was just 35.\\\"\\n\\n**[VIRGINIA ELECTION: MCAULIFFE APPEARS ON VIDEO WITH DISGRACED OFFICIAL WHO CALLED FOR DEFUNDING POLICE](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/virginia-mcauliffe-video-disgraced-official-defund-police)**\\n\\n\\\"One could argue that citing a weekend number in this fashion … certainly would leave the misleading impression he was talking about a one-day number,\\\" Kessler wrote, admitting that they then declined to do a fact-check. \\n\\nVirginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe fist bumps former U.S. President Barack Obama during his campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, U.S. October 23, 2021.
