"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A hundred damning fingers pointed at the solitary figure there. There were hoarse yells of: \\\"There he b& Yon's him! What's he done wi' it? Thief! Throttle him!\\\"\\n\\nThe mob came lumbering down the slope like one man, thundering their imprecations on a thousand throats. They looked dangerous, and their wrath was stimulated by the knot of angry Dalesmen who led the van. There was more than one white face among the women at the top of the slope as they watched the crowd blundering blindly down the hill. There were more men than Parson Leggy, the squire, James Moore, and the local constables in the thick of it all, striving frantically with voice and gesture, ay, and stick too, to stem the advance.\\n\\nIt was useless; on the dark wave rolled, irresistible.\\n\\nOn the far bank stood the little man, motionless, awaiting them with a grin upon his face. And a little farther in front was the Tailless Tyke, his back and neck like a new-shorn wheat-field, as he rumbled a vast challenge.\\n\\n\\\"Come on, gentlemen!\\\" the little man cried. \\\"Come on! I'll hide for ye, never fear. Ye're a thousand to one and a dog. It's the odds ye like, Englishmen a'.\\\"\\n\\nAnd the mob, with murder in its throat, accepted the invitation and came on.\\n\\nAt the moment, however, from the slope above, clear above the tramp of the mulitude, a great voice bellowed: \\\"Way! Way! Way for Mr. Trotter!\\\" The advancing host checked and opened out; and the secretary of the meeting bundled through.\\n\\nHe was a small, fat man, fussy at any time, and perpetually perspiring. Now his face was crimson with rage and running; he gesticulated wildly; vague words bubbled forth, as his short legs twinkled down the slope.\\n\\nThe crowd paused to admire. Some one shouted a witticism, and the crowd laughed. For the moment the situation was saved.\\n\\nThe fat secretary hurried on down the slope, unheeding of any insult but the one. He bounced over the plank-bridge: and as he came closer, M'Adam saw that in each hand brandished a brick.\\n\\n\\\"Hoots, man! dinna throw!\\\" he cried, making a feint as though to turn in sudden terror.\\n\\n\\\"What's this? What's this?\\\" gasped the secretary, waving his arms.\\n\\n\\\"Bricks, 'twad seem,\\\" the other answered, staying his flight.\\n\\nThe secretary puffed up like a pudding in a hurry.\\n\\n\\\"Where's the Cup? Champion, Challenge, etc.,\\\" he jerked out. \\\"Mind, sir, you're responsible! wholly responsible! Dents, damages, delays! What's it all mean, sir? These--these monstrous creations \\\"--he brandished the bricks, and M'Adam started back-- \\\"wrapped, as I live, in straw, sir, in the Cup case, sir! the Cup case! No Cup! Infamous! Disgraceful! Insult me--meeting--committee-- every one! What's it mean, sir?\\\" He paused to pant, his body filling and emptying like a bladder.\\n\\nM'Adam approached him with one eye on the crowd, which was heaving forward again, threatening still, but sullen and silent.\\n\\n\\\"I pit 'em there,\\\" he whispered; and drew back to watch the effect of his disclosure.\\n\\nThe secretary gasped.\\n\\n\\\"You--you not only do this--amazing thing--these monstrosities\\\"-- he hurled the bricks furiously on the unoff ending ground--\\\" but you dare to tell me so!\\\"\\n\\nThe little man smiled.\\n\\n\\\"'Do wrang and conceal it, do right and confess it,' that's Englishmen's motto, and mine, as a rule; but this time I had ma reasons.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Reasons, sir! No reasons can justify such an extraordinary breach of all the--the decencies. Reasons? the reasons of a maniac. Not to say more, sir. Fraudulent detention--fraudulent, I say, sir! What were your precious reasons?\\\"\\n\\nThe mob with Tammas and Long Kirby at their head had now welinigh reached the plank-bridge. They still looked dangerous, and there were isolated cries of:\\n\\n\\\"Duck him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Chuck him in!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An' the dog!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wi' one o' they bricks about their necks!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There are my reasons!\\\" said M'Adam, pointing to the forest of menacing faces. \\\"Ye see I'm no beloved amang yonder gentlemen, and\\\"--in a stage whisper in the other's ear --\\\"I thocht maybe I'd be 'tacked on the road.\\\"\\n\\nTammas foremost of the crowd, had now his foot upon the first plank.\\n\\n\\\"Ye robber! ye thief! Wait till we set hands on ye, you and yer gorilla!\\\" he called.\\n\\nM'Adam half turned.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie,\\\" he said quietly, \\\"keep the bridge.\\\"\\n\\nAt the order the Tailless Tyke shot gladly forward, and the leaders on the bridge as hastily back. The dog galloped on to the rattling plank, took his post fair and square in the centre of the narrow way, and stood facing the hostile crew like Cerberus guarding the gates of hell: his bull-head was thrust forward, hackles up, teeth glinting, and a distant rumbling in his throat, as though daring them to come on.\\n\\n\\\"Yo' first, ole lad!\\\" said Tammas, hopping agilely behind Long Kirby.\\n\\n\\\"Nay; the old uns lead!\\\" cried the big smith, his face gray-white. He wrenched round, pinned the old man by the arms, and held him forcibly before him as a covering shield. There ensued an unseemly struggle betwixt the two valiants, Tammas bellowing and kicking in the throes of mortal fear.\\n\\n\\\"Jim Mason'll show us,\\\" he suggested at last.\\n\\n\\\"Nay,\\\" said honest Jim; \\\"I'm fear'd.\\\" He could say it with impunity; for the pluck of Postie Jim was a matter long past dispute.\\n\\nThen Jem Burton'd go first?\\n\\nNay; Jem had a lovin' wife and dear little kids at 'ome.\\n\\nThen Big Bell?\\n\\nBig Bell'd see 'isseif further first.\\n\\nA tall figure came forcing through the crowd, his face a little paler than its wont, and a formidable knob-kerry in his hand.\\n\\n\\\"I'm goin'!\\\" said David.\\n\\n\\\"But yo're not,\\\" answered burly Sam'l, gripping the boy from behind with arms like the roots of an oak. \\\"Your time'll coom soon enough by the look on yo' wi' niver no hurry.\\n\\nAnd the sense of the Dalesmen was with the big man; for, as old Rob Saunderson said:\\n\\n\\\"I reck'n he'd liefer claw on to your throat,. lad, nor ony o' oors.\\\"\\n\\nAs there was no one forthcoming to claim the honor of the lead, Tammas came forward with cunning counsel.\\n\\n\\\"Tell yo' what, lads, we'd best let 'em as don't know nowt at all aboot him go first. And onst they're on, mind, we winna let 'em off; but keep a-shovin' and a-boviri 'on 'em forra'd. Then us'll foller.\\n\\nBy this time there was a little naked space of green round the bridge-head, like a fairy circle, into which the uninitiated might not penetrate. Round this the mob hedged: the Dalesmen in front, striving knavishly back and bawling to those behind to leggo that shovin'; and these latter urging valorously forward, yelling jeers and contumely at the front rank. \\\"Come on! '0's afraid? Lerrus. through to 'em, then, ye Royal Stan'-backs!\\\"--for well they knew the impossibility of their demand.\\n\\nAnd as they wedged and jostled thus, there stole out from their midst as gallant a champion as ever trod the grass. He trotted out into the ring, the observed of all, and paused to gaze at the gaunt figure on the bridge. The sun lit the sprinkling of snow on the dome of his head; one forepaw was off the ground ;.. and he stood there, royally alert, scanning his antagonist.\\n\\n\\\"Th' Owd Un!\\\" went up in a roar fit to split the air as the hero of the day was recognized. And the Dalesmen gave a pace forward,, spontaneously as the gray knight-errant stole across the green.\\n\\n\\\"Oor Bob'll fetch him!\\\" they roared, their blood leaping to fever heat, and gripped their sticks, determined in stern reality to follow now.\\n\\nThe gray champion trotted up on to the\\n\\nbridge, and paused again, the long hair about his neck rising like a ruff, and a strange glint in his eyes; and the holder of the bridge never moved. Red and Gray stood thus, face to. face: the one gay yet resolute, the other motionless, his great head slowly sinking between his forelegs, seemingly petrified.\\n\\nThere was no shouting now: it was time for--deeds, not words. Only, above the stillness, came a sound from the bridge like the snore of a giant in his sleep, and blending, with it, a low, deep, purring thunder like some monster cat well pleased.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie,\\\" came a solitary voice from the far side, \\\"keep the bridge!\\\"\\n\\nOne ear went back, one ear was still for-'ward; the great head was low and lower between his forelegs and the glowing eyes rolled upward so that the watchers could see the murderous white.\\n\\nForward the gray dog stepped.\\n\\nThen, for the second time that afternoon, a -voice, stern and hard, came ringing down from the slope above over the heads of the many.\\n\\n\\\"Bob, lad, coom back!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He! he! I thocht that was comin',\\\" sneered the small voice over the stream.\\n\\nThe gray dog heard, and checked.\\n\\n\\\"Bob, lad, coom in, I say!\\\"\\n\\nAt that he swung round and marched slowly back, gallant as he had come, dignified still in his mortification.\\n\\nAnd Red Wull threw back his head and bellowed a paean of victory--challenge, triumph, 'scorn, all blended in that bull-like, bloodchilling blare.\\n\\nIn the mean time, M'Adam and the secretary had concluded their business. It had been settled that the Cup was to be delivered over to James Moore not later than the following Saturday.\\n\\n\\\"Saturday, see! at the latest!\\\" the secretary cried as he turned and trotted off.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Trotter,\\\" M'Adam called after him. \\\"I'm sorry, but ye maun bide this side the Lea till I've reached the foot o' the Pass. Gin they gentlemen \\\"--nodding toward the crowd\\n\\n\\\\--\\\"should set hands on me, why--\\\" and he shrugged his shoulders significantly. \\\"Forbye, Wullie's keepin' the bridge.\\\"\\n\\nWith that the little man strolled off leis-. urely; now dallying to pick a flower, now to wave a mocking hand at the furious mob, and so slowly on to the foot of the Muirk Muir Pass.\\n\\nThere he turned and whistled that shrill peculiar note.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie, Wullie, to me!\\\" he called.\\n\\nAt that, with one last threat thrown at the' thousand souls he had held at bay for thirty minutes, the Tailless Tyke swung about and galloped after his lord.\\n\\nChapter XIII.  THE FACE IN THE FRAME\\n\\nALL Friday M'Adarn never left the kitchen. He sat opposite the Cup, in a coma, as it were; and Red Wull lay motionless at his feet.\\n\\nSaturday came, and still the two never budged. Toward the evening the little man rose, all in a tremble, and took the Cup down from the mantelpiece; then he sat down again with it in his arms.\\n\\n\\\"Eh, Wullie, Wullie, is it a dream? Ha' they took her fra us? Eh, but it's you and I alane, lad.\\\"\\n\\nHe hugged it to him, crying silently, and rocking to and I ro like a mother with a dying child. And Red Wull sat up on his haunches, and weaved from side to side in sympathy.\\n\\nAs the dark was falling, David looked in.\\n\\nAt the sound of the opening door the little man swung round noiselessly, the Cup nursed in his arms, and glared, sullen and suspicious, at the boy; yet seemed not to recognize him. In the half-light David could see the tears coursing down the little wizened face.\\n\\n'Pon ma life, he's gaein' daft!\\\" was his comment as he turned away to Kenmuir. And again the mourners were left alone.\\n\\n\\\"A few hours noo, Wullie,\\\" the little man wailed, \\\"and she'll be gane. We won her, Wullie, you and I, won her fair: she's lit the hoose for us; she's softened a' for us--and God kens we needed it; she was the ae thing we had to look to and love. And noo they're takin' her awa', and 'twill be night agin. We've cherished her, we've garnished her, we've loved her like oor am; and noo she maun gang to strangers who know her not.\\\"\\n\\nHe rose to his feet, and the great dog rose with him. His voice heightened to a scream, and he swayed with the Cup in his arms till it seemed he must fall.\\n\\n\\\"Did they win her fair, Wullie? Na; they plotted, they conspired, they worked ilka am o' them agin us, and they beat us. Ay, and noo they're robbin' us--robbin' us! But they shallna ha' her. Oor's or naebody's, Wullie! We'll finish her sooner nor that.\\\"\\n\\nHe banged the Cup down on the table and rushed madly out of the room, Red Wull at his heels. In a moment he came running back, brandishing a great axe about his head.\\n\\n\\\"Come on, Wullie!\\\" he cried. \\\"'Scots wha hae'! Noo's the day and noo's the hour! Come on!\\\"\\n\\nOn. the table before him, serene and beautiful, stood the target of his madness. The little man ran at it, swinging his murderous weapon like a flail.\\n\\n\\\"Oor's or naebody's Wulliel Come on.\\n\\n'Lay the proud usurpers low'!\\\" He aimed a mighty buffet; and the Shepherds' Trophy-- the Shepherds' Trophy which had won through the hardships of a hundred years--was almost gone. It seemed to quiver as the blow fell. But the cruel steel missed, and the axe-head sank into the wood, clean and deep, like a spade in snow.\\n\\nRed Wull had leapt on to the table, and in his cavernous voice was grumbling a chorus to his master's yells. The little man danced up and down, tugging and straining at the axe-handle,\\n\\n\\\"You and I, Wullie!\\n\\n'Tyrants fall in every foe! Liberty's in every blow!'\\n\\nThe axe-head was as immoveable as the Muir Pike.\\n\\n'Let us do or die!'\\n\\nThe shaft snapped, and the little man tottered back. Red Wull jumped down from the table, and, in doing so, brushed against the Cup. It toppled\\\\* over on to the floor, and rolled tinkling away in the dust. And the little man fled madly out of the house, still screaming his war-song.\\n\\nWhen, late that night, M'Adam returned home, the Cup was gone. Down on his hands and knees he traced out its path, plain to see, where it had rolled along the dusty floor. Beyond that there was no sign.\\n\\nAt first he was too much overcome to speak. Then he raved round the room like a derelict ship, Red Wull following uneasily behind. He cursed; he blasphemed; he screamed and beat the walls with feverish hands. A stranger, passing, might well have thought this was a private Bedlam. At last, exhausted, he sat down and cried.\\n\\n\\\"It's David, Wullie, ye may depend; David that's robbed his father's hoose. Oh, it's a grand thing to ha' a dutiful son!\\\"--and he bowed his gray head in his hands.\\n\\nDavid, indeed, it was. He had come back to the Grange during his father's absence, and, taking the Cup from its grimy bed, had marched it away to its rightful home. For that evening at Kenmuir, James Moore had said to him:\\n\\n\\\"David, your father's not sent the Cup. I shall come and fetch it to-morrow.\\\" And David knew he meant it. Therefore, in order to save a collision between his father and his friend--a collision the issue of which he dared hardly contemplate, knowing, as he did, the unalterable determination of the one and the lunatic passion of the other--the boy had resolved to fetch the Cup himself, then and there, in the teeth, if needs be, of his father and the Tailless Tyke. And he had done it.\\n\\nWhen he reached home that night he marched, contrary to his wont, straight into the kitchen.\\n\\nThere sat his father facing the door, awaiting him, his hands upon his knees. For once the little man was alone; and David, brave though he was, thanked heaven devoutly that Red Wull was elsewhere.\\n\\nFor a while father and son kept silence, watching one another like two fencers.\\n\\n'Twas you as took ma Cup?\\\" asked the little man at last, leaning forward in his chair.\\n\\n'Twas me as took Mr. Moore's Cup,\\\" the boy replied. \\\"I thowt yo' mun ha' done wi' it--I found it all hashed upon the floor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You took it--pit up to it, nae doot, by James Moore.\\\"\\n\\nDavid made a gesture of dissent.\\n\\n\\\"Ay, by James Moore,\\\" his father continued. \\\"He dursena come hissel' for his ill-gotten spoils, so he sent the son to rob the father. The coward!\\\"--his whole frame shook with passion. \\\"I'd ha' thocht James Moore'd ha' bin man enough to come himself for what he wanted. I see noo I did him a wrang--I misjudged him. I kent him a heepocrite; am o' yer unco gudes; a man as looks one thing, says anither, and does a third; and noo I ken he's a coward. He's fear'd o' me, sic as I am, five foot twa in ma stockin's.\\\" He rose from his chair and drew himself up to his full\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Moore had nowt to do wi' it,\\\" David persisted.\\n\\n\\\"Ye're lyin'. James Moore pit ye to it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell yo' he did not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ye'd ha' bin willin' enough wi'oot him, if ye'd thocht o't, I grant ye. But ye've no the wits. All there is o' ye has gane to mak' yer rnuckle body. Hooiver, that's no matter. I'll settle wi' James Moore anither time. I'll settle wi' you noo, David M'Adam.\\\"\\n\\nHe paused, and looked the boy over from bead to foot.\\n\\nSo, ye're not only an idler! a wastrel! a liar! \\\"--he spat the words out. \\\"Ye're--God help ye--a thief!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm no thief!\\\" the boy returned hotly. \\\"I did but give to a mon what ma feyther-- shame on hirn!--wrongfully kept from him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Wrangfully?\\\" cried the little man, advancing with burning face.\\n\\n'Twas honorably done, keepin' what wasna your'n to keep! Holdin' back his rights from a man! Ay, if ony one's the thief, it's not me: it's you, I say, you! \\\"--and he looked his father in the face with flashing eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I'm the thief, am I?\\\" cried the other, incoherent with passion. \\\"Though ye're three times ma size, I'll teach ma son to speak so to me.\\\"\\n\\nThe old strap, now long disused, hung in the chimney corner. As he spoke the little man sprang back, ripped it from the wall, and, almost before David realized what he was at, had brought it down with a savage slash across his son's shoulders; and as he smote he whistled a shrill, imperative note:\\n\\n\\\"Wullie, Wullie, to me!\\\"\\n\\nDavid felt the blow through his coat like a bar of hot iron laid across his back. His passion seethed within him; every vein throbbed; every nerve quivered. In a minute he would wipe out, once and for all, the score of years; for the moment, however, there was urgent business on hand. For outside he could hear the quick patter of feet hard-galloping, and the scurry of a huge creature racing madly to a call.\\n\\nWith a bound he sprang at the open door; and again the strap came lashing down, and a wild voice:\\n\\n\\\"Quick, Wullie! For God's sake, quick!\\\"\\n\\nDavid slammed the door to. It shut with a rasping snap; and at the same moment a great body from without thundered against it with terrific violence, and a deep voice roared like the sea when thwarted of its prey.\\n\\n\\\"Too late, agin!\\\" said David, breathing hard; and shot the bolt home with a clang. Then he turned on his father.\\n\\n\\\"Noo,\\\" said he, \\\"man to man!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay,\\\" cried the other, \\\"father to son!\\\"\\n\\nThe little man half turned and leapt at the old musketoon hanging on the wall. He missed it, turned again, and struck with the strap full at the other's face. David caught the falling arm at the wrist, hitting it aside with such tremendous force that the bone all but snapped. Then he smote his father a terrible blow on the chest, and the little man staggered back, gasping, into the corner; while the strap dropped from his numbed fingers.\\n\\nOutside Red Wull whined and scratched; but the two men paid no heed.\\n\\nDavid strode forward; there was murder in his face. The little man saw it: his time was come; but his bitterest foe never impugned Adam M'Adam's courage.\\n\\nHe stood huddled in the corner, all dis-. hevelled, nursing one arm with the other, entirely unafraid.\\n\\n\\\"Mind, David,\\\" he said, quite calm, \\\"murder 'twill be, not manslaughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Murder 'twill be,\\\" the boy answered, in thick, low voice, and was across the room.\\n\\nOutside Red Wull banged and clawed high up on the door with impotent pats.\\n\\nThe little man suddenly slipped his hand in his pocket, pulled out something, and flung it. The missile pattered on his son's face like a rain-drop on a charging bull, and David smiled as he came on. It dropped softly on the table at his side; he looked down and--it was the face of his mother which gazed up at him!\\n\\n\\\"Mither!\\\" he sobbed, stopping short. \\\"Mither! Ma God, ye saved him--and me!\\\"\\n\\nHe stood there, utterly unhinged, shaking and whimpering.\\n\\nIt was some minutes before he pulled himself together; then he walked to the wall, took down a pair of shears, and seated himself at the table, still trembling. Near him lay the miniature, all torn and crumpled, and beside it the deep-buried axe-head.\\n\\nHe picked up the strap and began cutting it into little pieces.\\n\\n\\\"There! and there! and there!\\\" he said with each snip. \\\"An' ye hit me agin there may be no mither to save ye.\\\"\\n\\nM'Adam stood huddling in the corner. He shook like an aspen leaf; his eyes blazed in his white face; and he still nursed one arm with the other.\\n\\n\\\"Honor yer father,\\\" he quoted in small, low\\n\\nPART IV  THE BLACK KILLER\\n\\nChapter XIV. A MAD MAN\\n\\nTAMMAS is on his feet in the tap-room of the Arms, brandishing a pewter mug.\\n\\n\\\"Gen'lemen!\\\" he cries, his old face flushed; \\\"I gie you a toast. Stan' oop!\\\"\\n\\nThe knot of Dalesmen round the fire rises like one. The old man waves his mug before him, reckless of the good ale that drips on to the floor.\\n\\n\\\"The best sheep-dog i' th' North--Owd Bob o' Kenmuir!\\\" he cries. In an instant there is uproar: the merry applause of clinking pewters; the stamping of feet; the rattle of sticks. Rob Saunderson and old Jonas are cheering with the best; Tupper and Ned Hoppin are bellowing in one another's ears; Long Kirby and Jem Burton are thumping each other on the back; even Sam'l Todd and Sexton Ross are roused from their habitual melancholy.\\n\\n\\\"Here's to Th' Owd Un! Here's to oor Bob!\\\" yell stentorian voices; while Rob Saunderson has jumped on to a chair.\\n\\n\\\"Wi' the best sheep-dog i' th' North I gie yo' the Shepherd's Trophy!--won outreet as will be!\\\" he cries. Instantly the clamor redoubles.\\n\\n\\\"The Dale Cup and Th' Owd Un! The Trophy and oor Bob! 'Ip, 'ip, for the gray dogs! 'Ip, 'ip, for the best sheep-dog as ever was or will be! 'Ooray, 'ooray!\\\"\\n\\nIt is some minutes before the noise subsides; and slowly the enthusiasts resume their seats with hoarse throats and red faces.\\n\\n\\\"Gentlemen a'!\\\"\\n\\nA little unconsidered man is standing up at the back of the room. His face is aflame, and his hands twitch spasmodically; and, in front, with hackles up and eyes gleaming, is a huge, bull-like dog.\\n\\n\\\"Noo,\\\" cries the little man, \\\"I daur ye to repeat that lie!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Lie!\\\" screams Tammas; \\\"lie! I'll gie 'im lie! Lemme at im', I say!\\\"\\n\\nThe old man in his fury is half over the surrounding ring of chairs before Jim Mason on the one hand and Jonas Maddox on the other can pull him back.\",\"timestamp\":1641283339,\"title\":\"\\nThe crowd surged forward, then turned.
