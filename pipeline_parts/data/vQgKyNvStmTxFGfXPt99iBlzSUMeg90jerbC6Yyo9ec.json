"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The troop of the stars was posted in the immeasurable deeps of the firmament. There was, there would be, no moon, yet it was not black darkness, but rather a dimly purple twilight which lifted into its breast the wayward songs of the sea. And the songs and the stars seemed twin children of the wedded wave and night. Divinely soft was the wind, divinely dreamy the hour, and bearing something of youth as a galley from the East bears odors. Over the spirit of Artois a magical essence seemed scattered. And the youngness that lives forever, however deeply buried, in the man who is an artist, stirred, lifted itself up, stood erect to salute the night. As he came towards Vere he forgot. The poppy draught was at his lips. The extreme consciousness, which was both his strength and his curse, sank down for a moment and profoundly slept.\\n\\n\\\"Vere!\\\" he said. \\\"Vere, do I disturb you?\\\"\\n\\nThe girl turned softly on the bench and looked at him.\\n\\n\\\"No. I often come here. I like to be here at nightfall. Madre knows that. Did she tell you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You guessed?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I met Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\nHe stood near her.\\n\\n\\\"Where is Madre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"On the terrace. She preferred to stay quietly there. And so you have been working very hard?\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke gently, half smilingly, but not at all derisively.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. But how did you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I gathered it from something your mother said. Do you know, Vere, I think soon she will begin to wonder what you do when you are shut up for so long in your room.\\\"\\n\\nThe girl's face looked troubled for a moment.\\n\\n\\\"She doesn't--she has no idea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh no.\\\"\\n\\nVere was silent for a while.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if I ought to tell her, Monsieur Emile,\\\" she said at length.\\n\\n\\\"Tell her!\\\" Artois said, hastily. \\\"But I thought--\\\"\\n\\nHe checked himself, suddenly surprised at the keenness of his own desire to keep their little secret.\\n\\n\\\"I know. You mean what I said the other day. But--if Madre should be hurt. I don't think I have ever had a secret from her before, a real secret. But--it's like this. If Madre knows I shall feel horribly self-conscious, because of what I told you--her having tried and given it up. I shall feel guilty. Is it absurd?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And--and--I don't believe I shall be able to go on. Of course some day, if it turns out that I ever can do anything, I must tell. But that would be different. If it's certain that you can do a thing well it seems to me that you have a right to do it. But--till then--I'm a little coward, really.\\\"\\n\\nShe ended with a laugh that was almost deprecating.\\n\\n\\\"Don't tell your mother yet, Vere,\\\" said Artois, decisively. \\\"It is as you say: if you told her before you have thoroughly tried your wings you might be paralyzed. When, if ever, you can show her something really good she will be the first to encourage you. But--till then--I think with you that her influence in that direction would probably be discouraging. Indeed, I feel sure of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But if she should really begin to wonder! Perhaps she will ask. It's absurd, but I can't help feeling as if we, you and I, were conspirators, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed happily.\\n\\n\\\"What a blessed place this is!\\\" he said. \\\"One is made free of the ocean here. What is that far-away light?\\\"\\n\\nHe pointed.\\n\\n\\\"Low down? Oh, that must be the light of a fisherman, one of those who seek in the rocks for shell-fish.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How mysterious it looks, moving to and fro! One feels life there, the doings of unknown men in the darkness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if--would you hate to go out a little way in the boat? The men look so strange when one is near them, almost like fire-people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hate! Let us go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And we'll get Madre to come too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes.\\\"\\n\\nVere got up and they went into the house. As they came out upon the terrace Hermione took up her embroidery, and Gaspare, who was standing beside her, picked up the tray with the coffee-cups and went off with it towards the kitchen.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madre, we are going out a little way in the boat, and we want you to come with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where are you going?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To see the fishermen, just beyond the grotto of Virgilio. You will come?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do come, my friend,\\\" added Artois.\\n\\nBut Hermione sat still.\\n\\n\\\"I'm a little tired to-night,\\\" she answered. \\\"I think I would rather stay quietly here. You won't be long, will you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh no, Madre. Only a few minutes. But, really, won't you?\\\" Vere laid her hand on her mother's. \\\"It's so lovely on the sea to-night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know. But honestly, I'm lazy to-night.\\\"\\n\\nVere looked disappointed. She took away her hand gently.\\n\\n\\\"Then we'll stay with you, won't we, Monsieur Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Vere,\\\" said her mother quickly, before he could answer. \\\"You two go. I sha'n't be dull. You won't be very long?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, of course. But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Go, dearest, go. Are you going to row, Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could. Or shall we take Gaspare?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's Gaspare's supper-time,\\\" said Vere.\\n\\n\\\"Hush, then!\\\" said Artois, putting his finger to his lips. \\\"Let us creep down softly, or he will think it his duty to come with us, starving, and that would spoil everything. Au revoir, Hermione,\\\" he whispered.\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, Madre,\\\" whispered Vere.\\n\\nThey glided away, the big man and the light-footed child, going on tiptoe with elaborate precaution.\\n\\nAs Hermione looked after them, she said to herself:\\n\\n\\\"How young Emile is to-night!\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment she felt as if she were much older than he was.\\n\\nThey slipped down to the sea without attracting the attention of Gaspare, got into the little boat, and rowed gently out towards Nisida.\\n\\n\\\"I feel like a contrabandista,\\\" said Artois, as they stole under the lee of the island towards the open sea--\\\"as if Gaspare would fire upon us if he heard the sound of oars.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Quick! Quick! Let us get away. Pull harder, Monsieur Emile! How slow you are!\\\"\\n\\nLaughingly Artois bent to the oars.\\n\\n\\\"Vere, you are a baby!\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"And what are you, then, I should like to know?\\\" she answered, with dignity.\\n\\n\\\"I! I am an old fellow playing the fool.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly his gayety had evaporated, and he was conscious of his years. He let the boat drift for a moment.\\n\\n\\\"Check me another time, Vere, if you see me inclined to be buffo,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed I won't. Why should I? I like you best when you are quite natural.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. Look! There are the lights! Oh, how strange they are. Go a little nearer, but not too near.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me, then. Remember, I can't see.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. One, two, three--\\\"\\n\\nShe counted. Each time she said a number he pulled. And she, like a little coxswain, bent towards him with each word, giving him a bodily signal for the stroke. Presently she stretched out her hand.\\n\\n\\\"Stop!\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped at once. For a minute the boat glided on. Then the impetus he had given died away from it, and it floated quietly without perceptible movement upon the bosom of the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Now, Monsieur Emile, you must come and sit by me.\\\"\\n\\nTreading softly he obeyed her, and sat down near her, facing the shadowy coast.\\n\\n\\\"Now watch!\\\"\\n\\nThey sat in silence, while the boat drifted on the smooth and oily water almost in the shadow of the cliffs. At some distance beyond them the cliffs sank, and the shore curved sharply in the direction of the island with its fort. There was the enigmatic dimness, though not dense darkness, of the night. Nearer at hand the walls of rock made the night seem more mysterious, more profound, and at their base flickered the flames which had attracted Artois' attention. Fitfully now these flames, rising from some invisible brazier, or from some torch fed by it, fell upon half-naked forms of creatures mysteriously busy about some hidden task. Men they were, yet hardly men they seemed, but rather unknown denizens of rock, or wave, or underworld; now red-bodied against the gleam, now ethereally black as are shadows, and whimsical and shifty, yet always full of meaning that could not be divined. They bent, they crouched. They seemed to die down like a wave that is, then is not. Then rising they towered, lifting brawny arms towards the stars. Silence seemed to flow from them, to exude from their labors. And in the swiftness of their movements there was something that was sad. Or was it, perhaps, only pathetic, wistful with the wistfulness of the sea and of all nocturnal things? Artois did not ask, but his attention, the attention of mind and soul, was held by these distant voiceless beings as by a magic. And Vere was still as he was, tense as he was. All the poetry that lay beneath his realism, all the credulity that slept below his scepticism, all the ignorance that his knowledge strove to dominate, had its wild moment of liberty under the smiling stars. The lights moved and swayed. Now the seamed rock, with its cold veins and slimy crevices was gilded, its nudity clothed with fire. Now on the water a trail of glory fell, and travelled and died. Now the red men were utterly revealed, one watching with an ardor that was surely not of this world, some secret in the blackness, another turning as if to strike in defence of his companion. Then both fell back and were taken by the night. And out of the night came a strong voice across the water.\\n\\n\\\"Madre di Dio, che splendore!\\\"\\n\\nArtois got up, turned the boat, and began to row gently away, keeping near the base of the cliffs. He meant to take Vere back at once to the island, leaving the impression made upon her by the men of the fire vivid, and undisturbed by speech. But when they came to the huge mouth of the Grotto of Virgil, Vere said:\\n\\n\\\"Go in for a moment, please, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\nHe obeyed, thinking that the mother's love for this dark place was echoed by the child. Since his conversation with Hermione on the day of scirocco he had not been here, and as the boat glided under the hollow blackness of the vault, and there lay still, he remembered their conversation, the unloosing of her passion, the strength and tenacity of the nature she had shown to him, gripping the past with hands almost as unyielding as the tragic hands of death.\\n\\nAnd he waited in silence, and with a deep expectation, for the revelation of the child. It seemed to him that Vere had her purpose in coming here, as Hermione had had hers. And once more the words of the old man in \\\"Pelleas and Melisande\\\" haunted him. Once more he heard them in his heart.\\n\\n\\\"Now it's the child's turn.\\\"\\n\\nVere dropped her right hand over the gunwale till it touched the sea, making a tiny splash.\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Emile!\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Vere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you believe in the evil eye?\\\"\\n\\nArtois did not know what he had expected Vere to say, but her question seemed to strike his mind like a soft blow, it was so unforeseen.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" he answered.\\n\\nShe was silent. It was too dark for him to see her face at all clearly. He had only a vague general impression of her, of her slightness, vitality, youth, and half-dreamy excitement.\\n\\n\\\"Why do you ask me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Giulia said to me this evening that she was sure the new servant had the evil eye.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Peppina?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, that is her name.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you seen her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, not yet. It's odd, but I feel as if I would rather not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have you any reason for such a feeling?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think so. Poor thing! I know she has a dreadful scar. But I don't believe it's that. It's just a feeling I have.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I dare say it will have gone by the time we get back to the island.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps. It's nice and dark here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you like darkness, Vere?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sometimes. I do now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because I can talk better and be less afraid of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere! What nonsense! You are incapable of fear.\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed, but the laugh sounded serious, he thought.\\n\\n\\\"Real fear--perhaps. But you don't know\\\"--she paused--\\\"you don't know how I respect you.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a slight pressure on the last words.\\n\\n\\\"For all you've done, what you are. I never felt it as I have just lately, since--since--you know.\\\"\\n\\nArtois was conscious of a movement of his blood.\",\"timestamp\":1637314123,\"title\":\"\\nA little wind met him on the crest of the cliff, the definite caress of the night, which had now fallen ever so softly\"},\"digest\":\"0tTf0MApN1wOeSvw249Z-Jskj5E582Y3TXwmgGHyQfc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e15513EBD81b8159946378511dF1E78276e74F2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y2dEqou3zggK00ZEfguraxVO0RsEVePOq6EnbJIMzs0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"keEfKFpFlKk_0voQA-kMiHpIk1KEUNYoYJllqpodGo0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"YnEfWCwHBw9eMupBpGXDC4KNI7qKJL6VgmBEPjRtypEId0f4XJM1rqBwku_ibR9NISqFHosTjQSRPgDAbMFCPw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x67253c7e31c8b143edcda884056b0b3f656fecfd7a8c07951521c9e4e2cf203936c6454f78cd1bb3e0c24bbf977bc8c6dbb041d954eeea926d5cf839673169251b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"y2dEqou3zggK00ZEfguraxVO0RsEVePOq6EnbJIMzs0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"keEfKFpFlKk_0voQA-kMiHpIk1KEUNYoYJllqpodGo0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"0tTf0MApN1wOeSvw249Z-Jskj5E582Y3TXwmgGHyQfc\"}"
