"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Everyone has his favorite teacher ,so do I. My favourite teacher is Miss Chen, our English teacher. She is humorous, she often tells us many jokes in classes.We felt English very difficuit when we began to study English. Miss Chen had a good idea to solve the problem. One day, Miss Chen came into the classroom with some fruits, such as apples,bananas,and oranges. She said: “Today we are going to learn the names of the fruits. You can eat the fruits if you can tell me their names in English . ”All the students listened carefully and studied hard . Someone even stood up to answer questions. Class was over ,and the fruits were all eaten. From then on ,I am more and more interested in English, and I want to say from my heart: “ Thank you, Miss Chen!”\",\"timestamp\":1639128052,\"title\":\"My Favorite Teacher\"},\"digest\":\"eUNM67oDjgYpncljVcf7MASEYtCfqH1QRBbrWH8Y8oQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x647d7B7ae4f1D0B4bD9c725827b279a33c6E6157\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tq7itJYovMSpTWt9b5AWcSb4v2a0wVJX_GIqOV1dfEs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KXUjm_A5IizHJKiHqckz1UOEp8k5liBQ1v3Lo60-Fo0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wg312dgtd_PEOEw_p7G_ENm8syw8Gvh0syZkIlAclow0IUBY40pjsN3O4ruez3iF6lLZVdHZJ6Ougtw_55yDtQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x56a897015b0f8db29e6a8835e3ace3c77068780bb81f833827e0ac10a85c65af65760059dc0dc34e2a76ae84610d410e7f4daa5921b6f45dd28bfa28c94faf541b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tq7itJYovMSpTWt9b5AWcSb4v2a0wVJX_GIqOV1dfEs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"KXUjm_A5IizHJKiHqckz1UOEp8k5liBQ1v3Lo60-Fo0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eUNM67oDjgYpncljVcf7MASEYtCfqH1QRBbrWH8Y8oQ\"}"
