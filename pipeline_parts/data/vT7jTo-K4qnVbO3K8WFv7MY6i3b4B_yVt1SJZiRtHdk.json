"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"During every day I always try to think about ways to make our world better. How we can solve our generation’s biggest problems? As seen in this [list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vb8WWbsVyEJzl66_qqtZfFr2uLL07Y7SJH5XKldjDPY/edit) of the world’s hardest problems we should rush to find more sustainable ways to produce and distribute food, manage vast amounts of data in better ways and finally help people live healthier, meaningful and longer lives.\\n\\nBut where should someone start from? Where should we focus first? Is it a good choice to try and target everything?\\n\\nIn my way of thinking all of the above are interconnected. If you manage to find ways to handle big amounts of data you will be able to create and train bigger and stronger ML models. That in turn will help you accelerate developments in generative food production, longevity research and sustainable ways to produce and manage energy.\\n\\nSolving the world’s hardest problems is not an equation that uses only one variable. A lot of ideas, technologies, business models and minds have to come into the table and commit to work closely and in parallel in order for the outcome to be life changing.\\n\\nAs an individual I’m trying to create the mechanism that will accelerate research, product and services building that will contribute in this process in a big and influential way.\",\"timestamp\":1634116232,\"title\":\"On what to work on\"},\"digest\":\"iKZ-5C0JeZnxOAMiIcKAlR81mSBpDyMwR5BqrsbrH6I\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x01a68407BB0C965C218c944036C5dAAf7A224eBf\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FcGlXGEH-UVZ8ABnI_rJNyNxcHnDFJxfIVIR052BWEA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cK19fPT20VpPyjw5BAHfINpqp4_DsfliXKOraC7SoIA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VlB7SGEx8oitm0OTLE-IUlEFSWDpeRWrvVwbDKDK1Z8Zbmy8ZkJFULFnlF5rPgMLOwjclSfJFgXY8Rc3oQWuOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x871cc9e962d7995c5644f63e046fae60421866843bf57c9877fb21019b4ae43f746b84231834579edf371bc85f19774020ca5c6d6375c9e17f6bd469373b7bc01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FcGlXGEH-UVZ8ABnI_rJNyNxcHnDFJxfIVIR052BWEA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cK19fPT20VpPyjw5BAHfINpqp4_DsfliXKOraC7SoIA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iKZ-5C0JeZnxOAMiIcKAlR81mSBpDyMwR5BqrsbrH6I\"}"
