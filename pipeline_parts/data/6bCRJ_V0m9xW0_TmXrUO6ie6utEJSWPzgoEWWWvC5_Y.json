"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Oh, Colonel Stubbs, we ought to have stopped,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"It was my only comfort to see how very little I was wanted,\\\" said the Colonel. \\\"If I had broke my neck instead of wetting my feet it would have been just the same to some people.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Jonathan!\\\" said Nina, really shocked.\\n\\n\\\"We ought to have stopped. I know we ought to have stopped,\\\" said Ayala, almost crying.\\n\\n\\\"Nobody ever stops for anyone out hunting,\\\" said Twentyman, laying down a great law.\\n\\n\\\"I should think not,\\\" said Captain Batsby, who had hardly been off the road all the time.\\n\\n\\\"I am sure the Colonel will not be angry with me because I took the young ladies on,\\\" said Larry.\\n\\n\\\"The Colonel is such a muff\\\", said the Colonel himself, \\\"that he will never presume to be angry with anybody again. But if my cousin and Miss Dormer are not very much obliged to you for what you have done for them there will be nothing of gratitude left in the female British bosom. You have probably given to them the most triumphant moment of their existence.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was their own riding, Colonel; I had nothing to do with it.\\\" \\\"I am so much obliged to you, Sir,\\\" said Nina.\\n\\n\\\"And so am I,\\\" said Ayala, \\\"though it was such a pity that Colonel Stubbs got into the water.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment came the long expected call. Tony Tappett had killed his fox, after crossing and re-crossing through the wood half a score of times. \\\"Is it all over?\\\" asked Ayala, as they hurried down the knoll and scurried down the line to get to the spot outside the wood to which Tony was dragging the carcass of his defeated enemy.\\n\\n\\\"It's all over for him,\\\" said Larry. \\\"A good fox he was, but he'll never run again. He is one of them bred at Littlecotes. The foxes bred at Littlecotes always run.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And is he dead?\\\" asked Nina. \\\"Poor fellow! I wish it wasn't necessary to kill them.\\\" Then they stood by till they saw the body of the victim thrown up into the air, and fall amongst the blood-smirched upturned noses of the expectant pack.\\n\\n\\\"I call that a pretty little run, Sir Harry,\\\" said Larry Twentyman. \\\"Pretty well,\\\" said Sir Harry; \\\"the pace wasn't very great, or that pony of mine which Miss Dormer is riding could not have lived with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Horses, Sir Harry, don't want so much pace, if they are allowed to go straight. It's when a man doesn't get well away, or has made a mess with his fences, that he needs an extra allowance of pace to catch the hounds. If you're once with them and can go straight you may keep your place without such a deal of legs.\\\" To this Sir Harry replied only by a grunt, as on the present occasion he had \\\"made a mess with his fences,\\\" as Larry Twentyman had called it.\\n\\n\\\"And now, young ladies,\\\" said Larry, \\\"I hope you'll come in and see my missus and her baby, and have a little bit of lunch, such as it is.\\\"\\n\\nNina asked anxiously whether there would not be another fox. Ayala also was anxious lest in accepting the proffered hospitality she should lose any of the delights of the day. But it was at length arranged that a quarter of an hour should be allowed before Tony took his hounds over to the Bragton coverts. Immediately Larry was off his horse, rushing into the house and ordering everyone about it to come forth with bread and cheese and sherry and beer. In spite of what he had said of his ruin it was known that Larry Twentyman was a warm man, and that no man in Rufford gave what he had to give with a fuller heart. His house was in the middle of the Rufford and Ufford hunting country, and the consumption there during the hunting months of bread and cheese, sherry and beer, must have been immense. Everyone seemed to be intimate with him, and all called for what they wanted as if they were on their own premises. On such occasions as these Larry was a proud man; for no one in those parts carried a lighter heart or was more fond of popularity.\\n\\nThe parlour inside was by no means big enough to hold the crowding guests, who therefore munched their bread and cheese and drank their beer round the front door, without dismounting from their horses; but Nina and Ayala with their friend the Colonel were taken inside to see Mrs Twentyman and her baby. \\\"Now, Larry, what sort of a run was it?\\\" said the young mother. \\\"Where did you find him, and what line did he take?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell you all about it when I come back; there are two young ladies for you now to look after.\\\" Then he introduced his wife and the baby which was in her arms. \\\"The little fellow is only six weeks old, and yet she wanted to come to the meet. She'd have been riding to hounds if I'd let her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\" said Mrs Twentyman. \\\"At any rate I might have gone in the pony carriage and had baby with me.\\n\\n\\\"Only six weeks old!\\\" said Nina, stooping down and kissing the child.\\n\\n\\\"He is a darling!\\\" said Ayala. \\\"I hope he'll go out hunting some day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He'll want to go six times a week if he's anything like his father,\\\" said Mrs Twentyman.\\n\\n\\\"And seven times if he's like his mother,\\\" said Larry. Then again they mounted their nags, and trotted off across the high roads to the Bragton coverts. Mrs Twentyman with her baby in her arms walked down to the gate at the high road and watched them with longing eyes, till Tony and the hounds were out of sight.\\n\\nNothing further in the way of hunting was done that day which requires to be recorded. They drew various coverts and found a fox or two, but the scent, which had been so strong in the morning, seemed to have gone, and the glory of the day was over. The two girls and the Colonel remained companions during the afternoon, and succeeded in making themselves merry over the incident of the brook. The Colonel was in truth well pleased that Larry Twentyman should have taken his place, though he probably would not have been gratified had he seen Captain Batsby assume his duties. It had been his delight to see the two girls ride, and he had been near enough to see them. He was one of those men who, though fond of hunting, take no special glory in it, and are devoid of the jealousy of riding. Not to have a good place in a run was no worse to him than to lose a game of billiards or a rubber of whist. Let the reader understand that this trait in his character is not mentioned with approbation. \\\"Always to excel and to go ahead of everybody\\\" should, the present writer thinks, be in the heart of every man who rides to hounds. There was in our Colonel a philosophical way of looking into the thing which perhaps became him as a man, but was deleterious to his character as a sportsman.\\n\\n\\\"I do hope you've enjoyed yourself, Ayala!\\\" he said, as he lifted her from her horse.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed -- indeed, I have!\\\" said Ayala, not noticing the use of her Christian name. \\\"I have been so happy, and I'm so much obliged to you!'\\n\\nCHAPTER 25 \\\"YOU ARE NOT HE\\\"\\n\\nAyala had been a week at Stalham, and according to the understanding which had existed she should now have returned to Kingsbury Crescent. She had come for a week, and she had had her week. Oh, what a week it had been, so thoroughly happy, without a cloud, filled full with ecstatic pleasures! Jonathan Stubbs had become to her the pleasantest of friends. Lady Albury had covered her with caresses and little presents. Nina was the most perfect of friends. Sir Harry had never been cross, except for that one moment in the wood. And as for Sprite -- Sprite had nearly realised her idea of an Angel of Light. Oh, how happy she had been! She was to return on the Monday, having thus comprised two Sundays within her elongated week. She knew that her heaven was to be at an end; but she was grateful, and was determined in her gratitude to be happy and cheerful to the close. But early on this Sunday morning Colonel Stubbs spoke a word to Lady Albury. \\\"That little girl is so thoroughly happy here. Cannot you prolong it for her just for another three days?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it to be for her -- or for Colonel Stubbs, who is enamoured of the little girl?\\\" asked Lady Albury.\\n\\n\\\"For both,\\\" said the Colonel, rather gravely.\\n\\n\\\"Are you in earnest?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you call in earnest? I do love to see a pretty creature enjoy herself thoroughly as she does. If you will make her stay till Thursday Albury will let her ride the little horse again at Star Cross on Wednesday.\\n\\n\\\"Of course she shall stay -- all the season if you wish it. She is indeed a happy girl if you are in earnest.\\\"\\n\\nThen it was settled, and Lady Albury in her happiest manner informed Ayala that she was not to be allowed to take her departure till after she had ridden Sprite once again. \\\"Sir Harry says that you have given the little horse quite a name, and that you must finish off his character for him at Star Cross.\\\" As was the heart of the Peri when the gate of Paradise was opened for her so was the heart of Ayala. There were to be four days, with the fourth as a hunting day, before she need think of going! There was an eternity of bliss before her.\\n\\n\\\"But Aunt Margaret!\\\" she said, not, however, doubting for a moment that she would stay. Who cares for a frowning aunt at the distance of an eternity. I fear that in the ecstasy of her joy she had forgotten the promise made, that she would always remember her aunt's goodness to her. \\\"I will write a note to Mrs Dosett, and make it all straight,\\\" said Lady Albury. The note was written, and, whether matters were straight or crooked at Kingsbury Crescent, Ayala remained at Albury.\\n\\nColonel Stubbs had thought about the matter, and determined that he was quite in earnest. He had, he told himself, enough for modest living -- for modest living without poverty. More would come to him when old General Stubbs, his uncle, should die. The general was already past seventy. What was the use of independence if he could not allow himself to have the girl whom he really loved? Had any human being so perfectly lovely as Ayala ever flashed before his eyes before? Was there ever a sweeter voice heard from a woman's mouth? And then all her little ways and motions -- her very tricks -- how full of charm they were! When she would open her eyes and nod her head, and pout with her lips, he would declare to himself that he could no longer live without her. And then every word that fell from her lips seemed to have something in it of pretty humour. In fact the Colonel was in love, and had now resolved that he would give way to his love in spite of his aunt, the Marchesa, and in spite of his own philosophy. He felt by no means sure of success, but yet he thought that he might succeed. From the moment in which, as the reader may remember, he had accosted her at the ball, and desired her to dance with him in obedience to his aunt's behests, it had been understood by everyone around him that Ayala had liked him. They had become fast friends. Ayala allowed him to do many little things which, by some feminine instinct of her own, would have been put altogether beyond the reach of Captain Batsby. The Colonel knew all this, and knew at the same time that he should not trust to it only. But still he could not but trust to it in some degree. Lady Albury had told him that Ayala would be a happy girl if he were in earnest, and he himself was well aware of Ayala's dependent position, and of the discomforts of Kingsbury Crescent. Ayala had spoken quite openly to him of Kingsbury Crescent as to a confidential friend. But on all that he did not lean much as being in his favour. He could understand that such a girl as Ayala would not accept a husband merely with the object of avoiding domestic poverty. Little qualms of doubt came upon him as he remembered the nature of the girl, so that he confessed to himself that Lady Albury knew nothing about it. But, nevertheless, he hoped. His red hair and his ugly face had never yet stood against him among the women with whom he had lived. He had been taught by popularity to think himself a popular man -- and then Ayala had shown so many signs of her friendship!\\n\\nThere was shooting on Saturday, and he went out with the shooters, saying nothing to anyone of an intended early return; but at three o'clock he was back at the house. Then he found that Ayala was out in the carriage, and he waited. He sat in the library pretending to read, till he heard the sounds of the carriage wheels, and then he met the ladies in the hall. \\\"Are they all home from shooting?\\\" asked Lady Albury. The Colonel explained that no one was home but himself. He had missed three cock-pheasants running, and had then come away in disgust. \\\"I am the most ignominious creature in existence,\\\" he said laughing; \\\"one day I tumble into a ditch three feet wide -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was ten yards at least,\\\" said Nina, jealous as to the glory of her jump.\\n\\n\\\"And today I cannot hit a bird. I shall take to writing a book and leave the severer pursuit of sport to more enterprising persons.\\\" Then suddenly turning round he said to Ayala, \\\"Are you good-natured enough to come and take a walk with me in the shrubbery?\\\"\\n\\nAyala, taken somewhat by surprise at the request, looked up into Lady Albury's face. \\\"Go with him, my dear, if you are not tired,\\\" said Lady Albury. \\\"He deserves consolation after all his good deeds to you.\\\" Ayala still doubted. Though she was on terms of pleasant friendship with the man, yet she felt almost awestruck at this sudden request that she should walk alone with him. But not to do so, especially after Lady Albury's injunction, would have been peculiar. She certainly was not tired and had such a walk come naturally it would have been an additional pleasure to her; but now, though she went she hesitated, and showed her hesitation.\\n\\n\\\"Are you afraid to come with me?\\\" he said, as soon as they were out on the gravel together.\\n\\n\\\"Afraid! Oh, dear no, I should not be afraid to go anywhere with you, I think; only it seems odd that you did not ask Nina too.\\\" \\\"Shall I tell you why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why was it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because I have something to say to you which I do not wish Nina to hear just at this moment. And then I thought that we were such friends that you would not mind coming with me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course we are,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know why it should be so, but I seem to have known you years instead of days.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps that is because you knew papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"More likely because I have learnt to know your papa's daughter.\\\" \\\"Do you mean Lucy?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I mean Ayala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is saying the same thing twice over. You know me because you know me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just that. How long do you suppose I have known that Mrs Gregory, who sat opposite to us yesterday?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can I tell?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Just fifteen years. I was going to Harrow when she came as a young girl to stay with my mother. Her people and my people had known each other for the last fifty years. Since that I have seen her constantly, and of course we are very intimate.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know as much about her after all that as if we had lived in two different hemispheres and couldn't speak a word of each other's language. There isn't a thought or a feeling in common between us. I ask after her husband and her children, and then tell her it's going to rain. She says something about the old General's health, and then there is an end of everything between us. When next we meet we do it all over again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How very uninteresting!\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Very uninteresting. It is because there are so many Mrs Gregorys about that I like to go down to Drumcaller and live by myself. Perhaps you're a Mrs Gregory to somebody.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should I be a Mrs Gregory? I don't think I am at all like Mrs Gregory.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not to me, Ayala.\\\" Now she heard the \\\"Ayala\\\", and felt something of what it meant. There had been moments at which she had almost disliked to hear him call her Miss Dormer; but now -- now she wished that he had not called her Ayala. She strove to assume a serious expression of face, but having done so she could not dare to turn it up towards him. The glance of her little anger, if there was any, fell only upon the ground. \\\"It is because you are to me a creature so essentially different from Mrs Gregory that I seem to know you so well. I never want to go to Drumcaller if you are near me -- or, if I think of Drumcaller, it is that I might be there with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sure the place is very pretty, but I don't suppose I shall ever see it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you know about your sister and Mr Hamel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Ayala, surprised. \\\"She has told me all about it. How do you know?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He was staying at Drumcaller -- he and I together with no one else -- when he went over to ask her. I never saw a man so happy as when he came back from Glenbogie. He had got all that he wanted in the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do so love him because he loves her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And I love her -- because she loves you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is not the same, you know,\\\" said Ayala, trying to think it all out.\\n\\n\\\"May I not love her?\\n\\n\\\"He is to be my brother. That's why I love him. She can't be your sister.\\\" The poor girl, though she had tried to think it all out, had not thought very far.\\n\\n\\\"Can she not?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Of course not. Lucy is to marry Mr Hamel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And whom am I to marry?\\\" Then she saw it all. \\\"Ayala -- Ayala -- who is to be my wife?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do not know,\\\" she said -- speaking with a gruff voice, but still in a whisper, with a manner altogether different -- thinking how well it would be that she should be taken at once back into the house.\\n\\n\\\"Do you know whom I would fain have as my wife?\\\" Then he felt that it behoved him to speak out plainly. He was already sure that she would not at once tell him that it should be as he would have it -- that she would not instantly throw herself into his arms. But he must speak plainly to her, and then fight his cause as best he might. \\\"Ayala, I have asked you to come out with me that I might ask you to be my wife. It is that that I did not wish Nina to hear at once. If you will put out your hand and say that it shall be so, Nina and all the world shall know it. I shall be as proud then as Hamel, and as happy -- happier, I think. It seems to me that no one can love as I do now, Ayala; it has grown upon me from hour to hour as I have seen you. When I first took you away to that dance it was so already. Do you remember that night at the theatre -- when I had come away from everything and striven so hard that I might be near to you before you went back to your home? Ayala, I loved you then so dearly -- but not as I love you now. When I saw you riding away from me yesterday, when I could not get over the brook, I told myself that unless I might catch you at last, and have you all to myself, I could never again be happy. Do you remember when you stooped down and kissed that man's baby at the farmhouse? Oh, Ayala, I thought then that if you would not be my wife -- if you would not be my wife -- I should never have wife, never should have baby, never should have home of my own.\\\" She walked on by his side, listening, but she had not a word to say to him. It had been easy enough to her to reject and to rebuke and to scorn Tom Tringle, when he had persisted in his suit; but she knew not with what words to reject this man who stood so high in her estimation, who was in many respects so perfect, whom she so thoroughly liked -- but whom, nevertheless she must reject. He was not the Angel of Light. There was nothing there of the azure wings upon which should soar the all but celestial being to whom she could condescend to give herself and her love. He was pleasant, good, friendly, kind-hearted -- all that a friend or a brother should be; but he was not the Angel of Light. She was sure of that. She told herself that she was quite sure of it, as she walked beside him in silence along the path. \\\"You know what I mean, Ayala, when I tell you that I love you,\\\" he continued. But still she made no answer. \\\"I have seen at last the one human being with whom I feel that I can be happy to spend my life, and, having seen her, I ask her to be my wife. The hope has been dwelling with me and growing since I first met you. Shall it be a vain hope? Ayala, may I still hope?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she said, abruptly.\\n\\n\\\"Is that all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is all that I can say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is that one 'no' to be the end of everything between us?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know what else I ought to say to you, Colonel Stubbs.\\\" \\\"Do you mean that you can never love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"That is a hard word -- and hardly friendly. Is there to be no more than one hard word between you and me? Though I did not venture to think that you could tell me that you loved me, I looked for something kinder, something gentler than that.\\\" From such a sharp and waspish word as \\\"no\\\",To pluck the sting!\\n\\nAyala did not know the lines I have quoted, but the idea conveyed in them was present clearly to her mind. She would fain have told him, had she known how to do so, that her heart was very gentle towards him, was very kind, gentle and kind as a sister's -- but that she could not love him, so as to become his wife. \\\"You are not he -- not he, not that Angel of Light, which must come to me, radiant with poetry, beautiful to the eye, full of all excellences of art, lifted above the earth by the qualities of his mind -- such a one as must come to me if it be that I am ever to confess that I love. You are not he, and I cannot love you. But you shall be the next to him in my estimation, and you are already so dear to me that I would be tender to you, would be gentle -- if only I knew how.\\\" It was all there, clear enough in her mind, but she had not the words. \\\"I don't know what it is that I ought to say,\\\" she exclaimed through her sobs. \\\"The truth, at any rate,\\\" he answered sternly, \\\"but not the truth, half and half, after the fashion of some young ladies. Do not think that you should palter with the truth either because it may not be palatable to me, or seem decorous to yourself. To my happiness this matter is all important, and you are something to my happiness, if only because I have risked it on your love. Tell me -- why cannot you love me?\\\"\\n\\nThe altered tone of his voice, which now had in it something of severity, seemed to give her more power.\\n\\n\\\"It is because -- \\\" Then she paused.\\n\\n\\\"Because why? Out with it, whatever it is. If it be something that a man may remedy I will remedy it. Do not fear to hurt me. Is it because I am ugly? That I cannot remedy.\\\" She did not dare to tell him that it was so, but she looked up at him, not dissenting by any motion of her head. \\\"Then God help me, for ugly I must remain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is not that only.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is it because my name is Stubbs -- Jonathan Stubbs?\\\" Now she did assent, nodding her head at him. He had bade her tell him the truth, and she was so anxious to do as he bade her! \\\"If it be so, Ayala, I must tell you that you are wrong -- wrong and foolish; that you are carried away by a feeling of romance, which is a false romance. Far be it from me to say that I could make you happy, but I am sure that your happiness cannot be made and cannot be marred by such accidents as that. Do you think that my means are not sufficient?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No -- no,\\\" she cried; \\\"I know nothing of your means. If I could love you I would not condescend to ask -- even to hear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no other man, I think?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no other man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But your imagination has depicted to you something grander than I am,\\\" -- then she assented quickly, turning round and nodding her head to him -- \\\"someone who shall better respond to that spirit of poetry which is within you?\\\" Again she nodded her head approvingly, as though to assure him that now he knew the whole truth. \\\"Then, Ayala, I must strive to soar till I can approach your dreams. But, if you dare to desire things which are really grand, do not allow yourself to be mean at the same time. Do not let the sound of a name move you, or I shall not believe in your aspirations. Now, shall I take you back to the house?\\\" Back to the house they went, and there was not another word spoken between them. By those last words of his she had felt herself to be rebuked. If it were possible that he could ask her again whether that sound, Jonathan Stubbs, had anything to do with it, she would let him know now, by some signal, that she no longer found a barrier in the name. But there were other barriers -- barriers which he himself had not pretended to call vain. As to his ugliness, that he had confessed he could not remedy; calling on God to pity him because he was so. And as for that something grander which he had described, and for which her soul sighed, he had simply said that he would seek for it. She was sure that he would not find it. It was not to such as he that the something grander -- which was to be the peculiar attribute of the Angel of Light -- could be accorded. But he had owned that the something grander might exist.\\n\\nCHAPTER 26 \\\"THE FINEST HERO THAT I EVER KNEW\\\"\\n\\nThe Colonel and Ayala returned to the house without a word. When they were passing through the hall she turned to go at once up the stairs to her own room. As she did so he put out his hand to her, and she took it. But she passed on without speaking, and when she was alone she considered it over all in her own mind. There could be no doubt that she was right. Of that she was quite sure. It was certainly a fixed law that a girl should not marry a man unless she loved him. She did not love this man, and therefore she ought not to marry him. But there were some qualms at her heart as to the possible reality of the image which she had created for her own idolatry. And she had been wounded when he told her that she should not allow herself to be mean amidst her soarings. She had been wounded, and yet she knew that he had been right. He had intended to teach her the same lesson when he told her the absurd story of the woman who had been flung out of the window. She could not love him; but that name of his should never again be a reason for not doing so. Let the Angel of Light come to her with his necessary angelic qualities, and no want of euphony in a sound should be a barrier to him. Nor in truth could any outside appearance be an attribute of angelic light. The Angel of Light might be there even with red hair. Something as to the truth of this also came across her, though the Colonel had not rebuked her on that head.\\n\\nBut how should she carry herself now during the four days which remained to her at Stalham Park? All the loveliness seemed to depart from her prospect. She would hardly know how to open her mouth before her late friend. She suspected that Lady Albury knew with what purpose the Colonel had taken her out in the shrubbery, and she would not dare to look Lady Albury in the face. How should she answer Nina if Nina were to ask her questions about the walk. The hunt for next Wednesday was no longer a delight to which she could look forward. How would it be possible that Colonel Stubbs should direct her now as to her riding, and instruct her as to her conduct in the hunting field? It would be better for her that she should return at once to Kingsbury Crescent.\\n\\nAs she thought of this there did come upon her a reflection that had she been able to accept Colonel Stubbs's offer there would have been an end for ever to the miseries of her aunt's house. She would have been lifted at once into the mode of life in which the man lived. Instead of being a stranger admitted by special grace into such an Elysium as that of Stalham Park, she would become one of those to whom such an Elysium belonged almost of right. By her own gifts she would have won her way into that upper and brighter life which seemed to her to be all smiles and all joy. As to his income she thought nothing and cared nothing. He lived with men who had horses and carriages, and who spent their time in pleasurable pursuits. And she would live amidst ladies who were always arrayed in bright garments, who, too, had horses and carriages at their command, and were never troubled by these sordid cares which made life at Kingsbury Crescent so sad and tedious. One little word would have done it all for her, would have enabled her to take the step by which she would be placed among the bright ones of the earth.\\n\\nBut the remembrance of all this only made her firmer in her resolution. If there was any law of right and wrong fixed absolutely in her bosom, it was this -- that no question of happiness or unhappiness, of suffering or joy, would affect her duty to the Angel of Light. She owed herself to him should he come to seek her. She owed herself to him no less, even should he fail to come. And she owed herself equally whether he should be rich or poor. As she was fortifying herself with these assurances Nina came to ask her whether she would not come down to tea. Ayala pleaded headache, and said that she would rest till dinner. \\\"Has anything happened?\\\" asked Nina. Ayala simply begged that she might be asked no questions then, because her head was aching. \\\"If you do not tell me everything, I shall think you are no true friend,\\\" said Nina, as she left the room.\\n\\nAs evening drew on she dressed for dinner, and went down into the drawing-room. In doing so it was necessary to pass through the billiard-room, and there she found Colonel Stubbs, knocking about the balls. \\\"Are you dressed for dinner?\\\" he exclaimed; \\\"I haven't begun to think of it yet, and Sir Harry hates a man when he comes in late. That wretch Batsby has beaten me four games.\\\" With that he rushed off, putting down the cue with a rattle, and seeming to Ayala to have recovered altogether from the late prostration of his spirits.\\n\\nIn the drawing-room Ayala was for a few minutes alone, and then, as she was glad to see, three or four ladies all came in at once, so that no question could be asked her by Lady Albury. They went into dinner without the Colonel, who was in truth late, and she was taken in by Mr Gosling, whose pretty little wife was just opposite to her. On the other side of her sat Lord Rufford, who had come to Stalham with his wife for a day or two, and who immediately began to congratulate her on the performance of the day before. \\\"I am told you jumped the Cranbury Brook,\\\" he said. \\\"I should as soon think of jumping the Serpentine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did it because somebody told me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah,\\\" said Lord Rufford, with a sigh, \\\"there is nothing like ignorance, innocence, and youth combined. But why didn't Colonel Stubbs get over after you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Because Colonel Stubbs couldn't,\\\" said that gentleman, as he took his seat in the vacant chair.\\n\\n\\\"It may be possible\\\", said Sir Harry, \\\"that a gentleman should not be able to jump over Cranbury Brook; but any gentleman, if he will take a little trouble, may come down in time for dinner.\\\" \\\"Now that I have been duly snubbed right and left\\\", said the Colonel, \\\"perhaps I may eat my soup.\\\"\\n\\nAyala, who had expected she hardly knew what further troubles, and who had almost feared that nobody would speak to her because she had misbehaved herself, endeavoured to take heart of grace when she found that all around her, including the Colonel himself, were as pleasant as ever. She had fancied that Lady Albury had looked at her specially when Colonel Stubbs took his seat, and she had specially noticed the fact that his chair had not been next her own. These little matters she was aware Lady Albury managed herself, and was aware also that in accordance with the due rotation of things she and the Colonel should have been placed together. She was glad that it was not so, but at the same time she was confident that Lady Albury knew something of what had passed between herself and her suitor. The evening, however, went off easily, and nothing occurred to disturb her except that the Colonel had called her by her Christian name, when as usual he brought to her a cup of tea in the drawing-room. Oh, that he would continue to do so, and yet not demand from her more than their old friendship!\\n\\nThe next morning was Sunday, and they all went to church. It was a law at Stalham that every one should go to church on Sunday morning. Sir Harry himself, who was not supposed to be a peculiarly religious man, was always angry when any male guest did not show himself in the enormous family pew. \\\"I call it d --  indecent,\\\" he has been heard to say. But nobody was expected to go twice -- and consequently nobody ever did go twice. Lunch was protracted later than usual. The men would roam about the grounds with cigars in their mouths, and ladies would take to reading in their own rooms, in following which occupation they would spend a considerable part of the afternoon asleep. On this afternoon Lady Albury did not go to sleep, but contrived to get Ayala alone upstairs into her little sittingroom. \\\"Ayala,\\\" she said, with something between a smile and a frown, \\\"I am afraid I am going to be angry with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Please don't be angry, Lady Albury.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I am right in what I surmise, you had an offer made to you yesterday which ought to satisfy the heart of almost any girl in England.\\\" Here she paused, but Ayala had not a word to say for herself. \\\"If it was so, the best man I know asked you to share his fortune with him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has he told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he did?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I shall not tell,\\\" said Ayala, proudly.\\n\\n\\\"I know he did. I knew that it was his intention before. Are you aware what kind of man is my cousin, Jonathan Stubbs? Has it occurred to you that in truth and gallantry, in honour, honesty, courage and real tenderness, he is so perfect as to be quite unlike to the crowd of men you see?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do know that he is good,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Good! Where will you find anyone good like him? Compare him to the other men around him, and then say whether he is good! Can it be possible that you should refuse the love of such a man as that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think I ought to be made to talk about it,\\\" said Ayala, hesitating.\\n\\n\\\"My dear, it is for your own sake and for his. When you go away from here it may be so difficult for him to see you again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't suppose he will ever want,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"It is sufficient that he wants it now. What better can you expect for yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I expect nothing,\\\" said Ayala, proudly. \\\"I have got nothing, and I expect nothing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He will give you everything, simply because he loves you. My dear, I should not take the trouble to tell you all this, did I not know that he is a man who ought to be accepted when he asks such a request as that. Your happiness would be safe in his hands.\\\" She paused, but Ayala had not a word to say. \\\"And he is not a man likely to renew such a request. He is too proud for that. I can conceive no possible reason for such a refusal unless it be that you are engaged. If there be someone else, then of course there must be an end of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no one else.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then, my dear, with your prospects it is sheer folly. When the General dies he will have over two thousand a year.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As if that had anything to do with it!\\\" said Ayala, holding herself aloft in her wrath, and throwing angry glances at the lady.\\n\\n\\\"It is what I call romance,\\\" said Lady Albury. \\\"Romance can never make you happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At any rate it is not riches. What you call romance may be what I like best. At any rate if I do not love Colonel Stubbs I am sure I ought not to marry him -- and I won't.\\\"\\n\\nAfter this there was nothing further to be said. Ayala thought that she would be turned out of the room -- almost out of the house, in disgrace. But Lady Albury, who was simply playing her part, was not in the least angry. \\\"Well, my dear,\\\" she said, \\\"pray -- pray, think better of it. I am in earnest, of course, because of my cousin -- because he seems to have put his heart upon it. He is just the man to be absolutely in love when he is in love. But I would not speak as I do unless I were sure that he would make you happy. My cousin Jonathan is to me the finest hero that I know. When a man is a hero he shouldn't be broken-hearted for want of a woman's smiles -- should he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She ought not to smile unless she loves him,\\\" said Ayala, as she left the room.\\n\\nThe Monday and Tuesday went very quietly. Lady Albury said nothing more on the great subject, and the Colonel behaved himself exactly as though there had been no word of love at all. There was nothing special said about the Wednesday's hunt through the two days, till Ayala almost thought that there would be no hunt for her. Nor, indeed, did she much wish for it. It had been the Colonel who had instigated her to deeds of daring, and under his sanction that she had ventured to ride. She would hardly know how to go through the Wednesday -- whether still to trust him, or whether to hold herself aloof from him. When nothing was said on the subject till late on the evening of the Tuesday, she had almost resolved that she would not put on her habit when the morning came. But just as she was about to leave the drawing-room with her bed-candle Colonel Stubbs came to her. \\\"Most of us ride to the meet tomorrow,\\\" he said; \\\"but you and Nina shall be taken in the waggonette so as to save you a little. It is all arranged.\\\" She bowed and thanked him, going to bed almost sorry that it should have been so settled. When the morning came Nina could not ride. She had hurt her foot, and, coming early into Ayala's room, declared with tears that she could not go. \\\"Then neither shall I,\\\" said Ayala, who was at that moment preparing to put on her habit.\\n\\n\\\"But you must. It is all settled, and Sir Harry would be offended if you did not go. What has Jonathan done that you should refuse to ride with him because I am lame?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nothing,\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Ayala, do tell me. I should tell you everything. Of course you must hunt whatever it is. Even though he should have offered and you refused him, of course you must go.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Must I?\\\" said Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"Then you have refused him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have. Oh, Nina, pray do not speak of it. Do not think of it if you can help it. Why should everything be disturbed because I have been a fool?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you think you have been a fool?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Other people think so; but if so I shall at any rate be constant to my folly. What I mean is, that it has been done, and should be passed over as done with. I am quite sure that I ought not to be scolded; but Lady Albury did scold me.\\\" Then they went down together to breakfast, Ayala having prepared herself properly for the hunting field.\\n\\nIn the waggonette there were with her Lady Albury, Mrs Gosling, and Nina, who was not prevented by her lameness from going to the meet. The gentlemen all rode, so that there was no immediate difficulty as to Colonel Stubbs. But when she had been put on her horse by his assistance and found herself compelled to ride away from the carriage, apparently under his especial guidance her heart misgave her, and she thoroughly wished that she was at home in the Crescent. Though she was specially under his guidance there were at first others close around her, and, while they were on the road going to the covert which they were to draw, conversation was kept up so that it was not necessary for her to speak -- but what should she do when she should find herself alone with him as would certain!y be the case? It soon was the case. The hounds were at work in a large wood in which she was told they might possibly pass the best part of the day, and it was not long before the men had dispersed themselves, some on this side some on that, and she found herself with no one near her but the Colonel. \\\"Ayala,\\\" he said, \\\"of course you know it is my duty to look after you, and to do it better if I can than I did on Friday.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I understand,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Do not let any remembrance of that walk on Saturday interfere with your happiness today. Who knows when you may be out hunting again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never!\\\" she said; \\\"I don't suppose I shall ever hunt again.\\\" \\\"Carpe diem,\\\" he said laughing. \\\"Do you know what 'carpe diem' means?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is Latin perhaps.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; and therefore you are not supposed to understand it. This is what it means. As an hour for joy has come, do not let any trouble interfere with it. Let it all be, for this day at least, as though there had been no walk in the Stalham Woods. There is Larry Twentyman. If I break down as I did on Friday you may always trust to him. Larry and you are old friends now.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Carpe diem,\\\" she said to herself. \\\"Oh, yes; if it were only possible. How is one to carpe diem with one's heart full of troubles?\\\" And it was the less possible because this man whom she had rejected was so anxious to do everything for her happiness. Lady Albury had told her that he was a hero -- that he was perfect in honour, honesty, and gallantry,; and she felt inclined to own that Lady Albury was almost right. Yet -- yet how far was he from that image of manly perfection which her daily thoughts had created for her! Could she have found an appropriate word with which to thank him she would have done so; but there was no such word; and Larry Twentyman was now with them, taking off his hat and overflowing with compliments. \\\"Oh, Miss Dormer, I am so delighted to see you out again.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639990984,\"title\":\"\\\"Oh, Jonathan, I am so sorry,\\\" said Nina, \\\"particularly about your getting into the water.\\\" \"},\"digest\":\"FnWj5pj-RERoup2OqxzEUGylDbHmBfFCr0GTy4oTZSM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x51D393CD2fE363A89232ff9D8Ac75A13bD6a52e7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2k8mo0IqZCTWYrP4naLbM24d63RK2PFnJMHndRpjNPI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FVZZpeXvWGeYs2BqvgmOyz_1dENcADM4XCC3bWrtpxA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Vm2jy12BusuTKJGOmPTh9WX9IDIoUkWGHn_AiOlW5i0mmYVNVX7pu3qywGG-j1SSjz5zguQzm3L8CNwaK5MunA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4d545dabfc393383a3be32c141623702487ae9098bbb303680d30df9509a7660400724ffede10a25a40e12e23e35b2ace993272790946321b88a0e5bd76b372f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2k8mo0IqZCTWYrP4naLbM24d63RK2PFnJMHndRpjNPI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FVZZpeXvWGeYs2BqvgmOyz_1dENcADM4XCC3bWrtpxA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FnWj5pj-RERoup2OqxzEUGylDbHmBfFCr0GTy4oTZSM\"}"
