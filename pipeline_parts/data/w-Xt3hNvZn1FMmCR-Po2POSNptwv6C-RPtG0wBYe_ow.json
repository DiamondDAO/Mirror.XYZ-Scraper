"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"#### Nil is a community-curated marketplace looking to harmonize the relationship between the creator economy participants.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mCD_5G_Yo6Z1Wi9_E2nX7.png?height=1440&width=2560&&&size=large)\\n\\n## Context\\n\\nNFTs are a revolutionary concept which allows novel form of value creation and distribution, liberating creators from traditional constraints.\\n\\nEven though, the so-called creator economy establishment is constrained by self-referencing centralized platforms obstructing creators and collectors’ experience.\\n\\n**By appropriating the means of artistic production’, centralized protocols limit the Cambrian Explosion intrinsic to permissionless technologies while arbitrarily deciding who will benefit from their recommendations.** In addition to favoring insider deals, this situation reduces the emergence of rising artists. \\n\\nNonetheless, curation mechanisms are necessary as they positively extract signals from noise while offering a built-in audience for promising artists. Both creators and collectors benefit from noiseless on-chain marketplaces where they can safely nourish fertile links. \\n\\n## General Overview\\n\\nDriven by the burning desire to offer NFT enthusiasts the decentralized experience they deserve, **Nil’s initial contributors introduce the Nil DAO, a decentralized cooperative leveraging the Nil Protocol V1.** \\n\\nThis article will serve as an overview of the mechanism implied in the Nil V1. The journey is just beginning, and contributors are confident the Nil fair launch will ignite a powerful federating movement serving creators all around the world.\\n\\n## Essential Concepts\\n\\n**At the core of Nil resides the concepts of creator’s ownership over their platform in addition to permissionless curation.** \\n\\nOperating simultaneously on Nil, those parties unlock powerful leverage for participants,  among which curating activities serve the artists while offering them a considerable network of passionate collectors.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3frthlkDVDeo-njxxzuPH.png?height=1148&width=2560&&&size=large)\\n\\n## Artists\\n\\n* **Creators apply to join the Nil cohort.** To be labeled, their request needs to be supported by the curator’s community.\\n* **Once part of the Nil cohort, creators enjoy the most creator-friendly launchpad.** Abstracting technical complexity, Nil offers them extensive distribution options: community granularity, pricing flexibility, time sequencing modularity, and more.\\n* **Exploiting the_N_projects community,** Nil represents a built-in amplification network of collectors looking to collect and support creators in their journey.\\n* Initially, **Nil DAO will not charge any primary fees.**\\n* In addition to their sales revenues, **creators generate $NIL** proportionally to the support demonstrated by the N stakeholders. Creators gain ownership over the ecosystem they contribute to, the greater their input, the greater their holdings.\\n* There is a premium for joining the Nil ecosystem early on. The earlier a creator releases on the platform, the greater the $NIL proportion they generate.  \\n* \\n* $ETH is the standard currency used to sell on Nil. Even tho, creators can choose to accept $NIL as a payment method, giving them **control over the $NIL supply as well as the $NIL demand.**\\n* Nil Labeled creators finally enjoy a lifelong brand moat additionally to exclusive access to the Nil cohort and anechoic chambers for creators to prosper with their peers.\\n\\n## Curators\\n\\n* **Stake your N and $NIL to become a curator.** \\n* **When staking tokens, curators generate Curating Power (CP).** \\n* Curators spend their CP to support applying creators. By carrying them early on, curators serve as their mécène, a contribution for which they will ad Vitam perceive up to 20% of the $NIL generated by those supported creators. This mechanism will be introduced in a post-launch release. \\n\\n#### Curators should rather start accumulating CP which will very soon fuel the Nil ecosystem. Start staking your n and $NIL.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OsHGWrqrt2BrYlNGjVcnx.png?height=4320&width=7680&&&size=large)\\n\\n* Curators constantly arbitrage between allocating their CP to popular creators massively supported or spreading it over the next talents for which they will perceive a great part of their generated $NIL.\\n\\n## Referral Program\\n\\n* **Additionally, the Nil Referral Program incentives peer-to-peer collaboration.**\\n* **Referrers perceives forever 6.66% of the $NIL generated by the creators they introduce to Nil.** This design incentive individuals to let the Nil flow among the world.\\n\\n## Collectors\\n\\n* **Save cash.** There are no fees on Nil.\\n* **Benefit from community-curated drops**,  increasing their time efficiency. This curation relies on game theory, maximizing the efficiency of the process.  \\n* Purchase and **mint from talented artists** in a secured way.\\n* N Holders will generally benefit from gas war free drops, making their collector journey fairer and less expensive.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RzY9F3qhQj6L-wuV2c3rq.png?height=1080&width=1920&&&size=large)\\n\\n## Cruise with us\\n\\nThis is the first article of a series dedicated to digging into the Nil Protocol mechanisms.
