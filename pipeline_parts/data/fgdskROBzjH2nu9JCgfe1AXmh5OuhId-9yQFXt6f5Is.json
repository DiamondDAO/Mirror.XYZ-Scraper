"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Preface\\n\\nIn this series, I attempt to explain to my \\\\~75 year old probability professor the importance of blockchains and Bitcoin. I use probabilistic concepts to aid my professors’ understanding of these topics. In Part 3 of this series, I focus on the security of blockchains using the probabilistic concept of a random walk and specifically the Gambler’s Ruin problem. \\n\\n## Security\\n\\nAside from decentralization, security is arguably the most important feature of blockchain technology and Bitcoin. I will now present how the nature of a blockchain is beneficial in preventing attacks to the network, and thus enhancing the security of a blockchain network versus traditional payment networks. The security inherent in the blockchain has to do with the irreversible nature of the chain. Once a transaction is validated, and a subsequent block is added to the blockchain, it cannot be undone. This is because the network of nodes always trusts and works off of the longest chain. Thus, for an attacker to reverse or edit a transaction, they would have to redo the proof-of-work of that block, all blocks after it, and then catch up with and surpass the work being done by the vast network of honest nodes. If an attacker were able to successfully create a longer chain than the honest chain, theoretically they could trick the system and effectively reverse or edit a past transaction. But, the probability of a slower attacker catching up diminishes exponentially as subsequent blocks are added.\\n\\nAlthough the probability of an attacker successfully catching up and attacking the network is greater than probability zero, I will now model the probability of such an attack to show that the probability approaches zero. Attacking the blockchain can be modeled using a random walk. Consider a scenario where an attacker attempts to generate an alternative chain longer than the honest chain. The race between an honest chain and the attacker chain can be modeled by a Binomial random walk. A success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, +1, and a failure event is the attacker chain being extended by one block, -1. The probability an attacker catches up is analogous to the Gambler’s Ruin Problem. We calculate the probability an attacker catches up with the honest chain as follows:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/J6_tMNhtyfFbU2ZQ2VerB.png?height=302&width=1114)\\n\\nGiven our assumption that *p* > *q*, the probability drops off exponentially as the number of blocks the attacker has to catch up with increases. If the attacker doesn’t make an early move to catch up, their probability will exponentially approach zero as they fall behind.\\n\\nWe will now consider how long a recipient of a Bitcoin transaction needs to wait before being certain that the sender can’t attack the system and reverse or alter the transaction. In this example, we are assuming the sender is the attacker who wants to make the receiver believe they have been paid only for the transaction to be reversed. Once the transaction is sent, the malicious sender begins preparing a parallel blockchain containing the altered version of the transaction. The receiver waits until the transaction has been added to the blockchain and *z* blocks have been added following it. The receiver does not know how much progress the attacker has made in their alternative chain, but he will assume the honest blocks took the average expected time per block. As such, the attacker's potential progress will be a Poisson distribution with expected value:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/wCrUXId5OcGhcbt3qE11w.png?height=192&width=694)\\n\\nNow, to find the probability of the attacker catching up, we multiply the Poisson density for each amount of progress he could have made by the probability he could catch up from that point:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ECqMSzhQULEssvxih1COA.png?height=238&width=848)\\n\\nRearranged we get:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yqtbbsjyyZ-MO4VD6bDSR.png?height=202&width=768)\\n\\nRunning some potential results we see the probability drops off exponentially with *z* (blocks) increasing:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-veqpyHGRY6OBynfd7RHW.png?height=612&width=1452)\\n\\nAs such, for two different *q* values (probability of an attacker catching up) of 0.1 and 0.3 it is clear that the probability of an attacker catching up approaches zero exponentially as the number of blocks it must catch up with increases. Concretely, this supports the belief that an attack on the Bitcoin network has a very low probability of success. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhat was just found was that the probability of an attack decreases exponentially as the number of blocks created by honest nodes increases. To put this into a real-world perspective, there are currently \\\\~15,000 nodes validating the Bitcoin network. We assume that all of these nodes are honest nodes, that is they are mining Bitcoin for the purpose of validating the network in hopes of receiving Bitcoin reward in return. And, the time to validate a transaction is on average 10 minutes. As such, for an individual attacker node (or group of attacker nodes), they must validate multiple transactions in a row faster than the \\\\~15,000 other validators. Assuming that the computing power of an individual honest node is roughly equal to that of an individual attacking node, the probability of attackers being able to harm the network is very low. \\n\\nThis shows the security of the Bitcoin network. By relying on a decentralized community of validators to operate and power the network, we now have a system that is self-sustainable and extremely difficult to infiltrate or attack. This is distinct from the current model we have in which large companies (whether it’s a bank or a big tech company) control and operate the network as well as store and manage all of its data. This makes these traditional institutions vulnerable to network failure or data breach as well as costing a lot of money to operate. From this, it is clear to see that Bitcoin and other Blockchain technologies are advantageous in their ability to maximize efficiency, lower costs, and maintain a secure network.\\n\\n## Works Cited\\n\\nChitty, T.
