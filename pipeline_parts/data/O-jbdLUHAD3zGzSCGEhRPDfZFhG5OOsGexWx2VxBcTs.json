"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*This is not a one-time post. Instead, this post will be home to my daily entries as I navigate through and participate in the first project by the [Jenkins the Valet Writers Room](https://cointelegraph.com/news/jenkins-the-valet-founder-wants-to-create-a-decentralized-web3-content-company). New posts will appear directly beneath this text. Older posts will be pushed ever downward.*\\n\\n### Thursday, December 30, 2021\\n\\n**Now I'm not a petty person, but...**\\n\\n**And the truth is, I could've done more due diligence, but...**\\n\\n**And I'm sure he's a nice guy and all, but...**\\n\\n**So the story is that I bought a Valet Ticket, which affords 5 votes and 1 license, but I wanted to be more involved with the Writer's Room. So I aped in again and got a secondary market Valet Key. Once I got it, I realized that it had already been licensed to an ape: BAYC 3220.** \\n\\nWell, I took that to be a great thing. After all, it was one less thing to do, and if this guy was already licensed to a key, then he must be keen to collaborate. So I tracked him down on Twitter. And I tracked him down on Discord. And I tracked him down in the Writers Room server. And I never got a response.\\n\\nDigging a little deeper, I learned the license was not a generous one. The owner of BAYC 3220 gets 100% of the royalties generated by Jenkins' Book One. The key holder (me), gets what's left, i.e., 0%. AKA, zero things. \\n\\nWhich is totally within his rights! And I should've checked the licensing before thunking down that goodly fraction of an ETH! And anyway/besides, the license only holds for Book One, which means the contract will end in however many SHORT YEARS that takes, then I'll be free to do all the licensing I want! So don't be bitter, I say! Don't be bitter! Don't do it!\\n\\nBut...\\n\\nAnd I'm not saying this is coming from a place of bitterness, but what I'm saying is that I'm sure there are plenty of people who want their apes to be heroes or (more likely) really badass anti-heroes. So there's probably a lot of room for assholes and doofuses. Right?\\n\\nSo here's the deal with BAYC 3220...\\n\\nRising tides raise all yachts, and BAYC 3220 is no different. In fact, I'm going to write my ass off for BAYC 3220. I want BAYC 3220 to make an appearance in the book, and I want the owner of BAYC 3220 to bathe in money because it proves the power of community collaboration at this incredible scale. \\n\\nBut BAYC 3220 will be the biggest twat in the Yacht Club. BAYC 3220's slimy, erumpent personality will make Joffrey Baratheon look like Jon Snow. People (and apes) will love to watch BAYC 3220 suffer. \\n\\n### Wednesday, December 29, 2021\\n\\n**Yesterday I finally dove into the Jenkins short stories to get a sense of the BAYC narrative world. These \\\"short stories\\\" are actually just 500-word introductions — of characters and their concomitant intrigue.**\\n\\nIn this world, rarity and valuation determine personal worth — pretty utopian, right? — and all lesser BAYCs (don't even mention Mutant Apes) get stuck in service positions, like our hero Jenkins, who sees his shiny job valet job at the Yacht Club as his chance to make a little scratch and do some wise hodling.\\n\\nBut combine Skull & Crossbones, The Five Families, the CIA, the FBI, and the KGB and you're only starting to approach the soul-sucking dastardliness of this moneyed place. Here, Jenkins learns that obedience and discretion can go a long way.\\n\\nJenkins first earns The Ape Father's trust. Then word gets around fast, and pretty soon he's helping out other apes — some of whom seem to be at cross-purposes. He helps a down-on-his-luck old-timer recover a priceless private key. He meets a famous former stuntman-turned-altcoin-shill and falls in love with a model ape who's appeared in magazines.\\n\\nThe more I read these stories, the more I drift into a Pynchonian mindset — who are the bad guys? are there good guys? who's got the money and who's got the drugs? are they the same people? why?\\n\\nThere will be plenty to report back. Next time, I'll recount a bit more of Jenkins' backstory, and soon I'll introduce the two apes I'll be co-licensing for Book 1.\\n\\n### Friday, December 24, 2021\\n\\n**Jenkins the Valet is making good on the paradigm-shifting move made by the creators of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. The move? Issue intellectual property rights with each NFT purchase, which — overnight — laid the groundwork for a potential extended narrative universe. The Writers Room is the natural outgrowth of that decision on the part of the BAYC creators.**\\n\\nIt’s been about two weeks since I bought my first Jenkins the Valet Writers Room ticket. It’s not even been a week since I decided that the ticket didn’t give me enough to work with, so I bought a Writers Room key.\\n\\nThis post will be the living document of my experience in The Writers Room. I plan to post my learnings, opinions, and creative process in this daily-updated article.\\n\\nOver the coming weeks, I will be:\\n\\n* Learning the ins and outs of existing Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC) lore and existing stories.\\n* Introducing my co-licensed apes and going through the process of building out their backstories and lore.\\n* Participating in the submitting proposals, voting, and collaborating with other apes and the official author of the first Jenkins the Valet novel, Neil Strauss.\",\"timestamp\":1640909743,\"title\":\"In the Jenkins Writers Room\"},\"digest\":\"92rL6hmcm1sKh98xf3gf4mo7KJiLXCbBkeiJCZV5BVA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x38D4E17B62BF1bADD7132aCDA9E4BFF009846978\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_SHVdRow9ekLC85wPR49S6Ug5awTmdqYhThkdIkwcIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AWb1Fa4BUAlupllCR-MLgtPcmVgwBNu5jncjscmE_Ts\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"imeC5Qt0xAjzJaIOdP_4BWm8Liinuna-HhHLSAxXxDN59qryHYMp2Gm8J9s_mFcu98L0tivI-hz9CDrZKh7MSg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3cfa4c77654c8fc5306772dd657468a246449425599d7fb2f956374e81b7dbb37e3b83c8f2033eab3f3a336184351f164b7030a33c0227025c5a7a70e6472c4a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_SHVdRow9ekLC85wPR49S6Ug5awTmdqYhThkdIkwcIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AWb1Fa4BUAlupllCR-MLgtPcmVgwBNu5jncjscmE_Ts\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LbKHkQf5YGAD70gnMuTMrSp2YmiVcpgUk6xTmaKQADE\"}"
