"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1999-2000-2001 \\n ** \\n It was to be an empire that would capture the rise of a network.\\n\\nThe old guard was scrambling to catch up. The would be upstarts were trying to stay ahead. Both were wary of a rising hoarde of electricity and light.\\n\\nThe old guard began with mergers of grand dame media. They were a titans in the age of print and copper wire toll bridges.\\n\\nTime merged with Warner Communications in 1990 for 14+B USD. Time Inc., a 1920s magazine startup, dominated print. Its internal zoning system for deliveries inspired the rise of postal zip codes, the indexing of the real world.  \\n  \\n Warner was a troubled 1970s parking lot business that mutated into media, publishing, talent agencies, film, music, video, cable - home of Superman and MTV.\\n\\nThe younger upstarts, walled electronic cities, were worried too.\\n\\nPeople brought their bicycles of the mind to enjoy the sights and sounds of a managed miniverses, manicured walled gardens.  \\n  \\n In Virginia was QuantumLink. There were others like Compuserve.\\n\\nPlayNET of Troy, NY licensed software to Quantum Computer Services, a struggling music on demand startup that pivoted into a failing video game business, and then into America Online.\\n\\nIt became the strongest of a handful of contenders. They knew their walls were useless as a sprawl of photons and electrons would consume them too.\\n\\nBoth old and new media kingdoms wanted to survive the rise of the Internet. They buried their vulnerabilities with the promise of becoming an epicenter of all media, old and new. The advisors said they could melt their advantages into one spearhead of 'synergies'.\\n\\nAttack surfaces hidden behind a single point of success failed.\\n\\nThe sprawl, of electrons and photons, swallowed them. \\n  \\n The empire failed, the pieces of AOL Time Warner were sold for scrap value. \\n \\n\\n**2877 EARTH, THE NECKLACE, MARS CONSULATE**\\n\\nI went back to the secure room. Its walls were flowing with the data streams from the peripheral. The room's autonomous intelligence was still wading through the device, making \\\"data bait\\\" for a trade.\\n\\n\\\"ROOM, show me an overview of the samples we have. Anything useful from tracking my visitor?”\\n\\n\\\"Commander, we have nothing useful from tracking the visitor, how do you want to rank these samples?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We want samples that are different from what Earth's oracles and 'chains have. I need data unavailable to grey market co-ops, grey marketeers for Earth, even if they stole it or used local brokers.\\n\\nThese co-ops are like the ones back home. They made a lot of money during the Long War as grey market operators. That's done.\\n\\nThey're all rushing to survive, adapting in different ways. Some will shrink, some will fold, and some will become darker co-ops.\\n\\nWe're making \\\"bait\\\" for the last kind of business, black market.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Commander, the Inspector is connecting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Connect.\\\"\\n\\nThe Inspector's image joined the data streams in the room.\\n\\n\\\"Commander, I saw you had a visitor, I thought she was still in the hospital. I had my feeds on, as a precaution. I can send your bait as soon as its ready. They have middlemen, one we turned.”\\n\\n“I need police 'oracles, to screen out data this co-op could steal. The best draw is something you want so bad and can't get from anyone or anywhere else, not even the authorities.\\n\\n\\\"Your visitor is proof, we can't lure out the head. You have to go in with the bait.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Get your people ready, Inspector. It's tomorrow. Midnight.”\\n\\n[https://audius.co/deadmau5/deadmau5-ban-hammer-333840](https://audius.co/deadmau5/deadmau5-ban-hammer-333840)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ah1Fqt-sFaCUxrpNs55Sr.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ypgwnb4Bt87USuv6sKxDV.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636143865,\"title\":\"1999 7.28: Hidden Behind A Single Point of Success\"},\"digest\":\"b37krxRWFNIxJbm6T-T0brQ-OLQBvdoRtnCqNqQ91eg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4CesnPiDiir17sanOd8_-3BS-KjZC3IdXre437GKj63tbK69-TB1jSPELY39egYa6UjpK3LGiFY9yPwS-wfdAw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"b37krxRWFNIxJbm6T-T0brQ-OLQBvdoRtnCqNqQ91eg\"}"
