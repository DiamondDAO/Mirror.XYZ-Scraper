We‚Äôre all here to support you as we work together on building this projects future.\\n\\n## Who can be a Collaborator?\\n\\n**Anybody** - even if you don‚Äôt have a specific skill set. Sometimes all a project needs is moral support, community assistance answering questions in our forums, or running small tasks like giving your feedback on a document.\\n\\n## üëã Introduce yourself\\n\\nIntroduce yourself. This is a **must**. Be noticed - Light up the sky üåü, don‚Äôt let anyone not-notice you arrived ‚ú®\\n\\n\\\\*- You can wait a while to survey the group, but try to make an intro within 10 days.\\n\\n* Hash tag your skills (if any)- EG.\\\\* `#bizdev, #CSS, #illustration, #callhosting`\\n* Who are you?\\n* What are your passions, hobbies, interests?\\n* How did you get here?\\n* Why are you here?\\n* What are you interested in?\\n* Who are you interested in connecting with?\\n* What skills -if any- can you offer to other members?\\n\\n## Types of Collaboration\\n\\n### Low-Level Collabs AKA ‚ÄúLurkers‚Äù\\n\\nWe‚Äôre all good with Lurkers. Lurkers hang out not saying much and generally observing the group. This is fine, though try to participate in votes and offer useful perspective occasionally.\\n\\n### Mid-Level Collabs AKA ‚ÄúCadets‚Äù\\n\\nCadets volunteer from time to time to help with crowd-tasking. For example, group admins, Ambassadors, or to help verify some venues. When you volunteer you‚Äôll be given a task that may take anything from 10 minutes to a couple of hours depending on various factors. These tasks may be random, or they can involve your special skill set.\\n\\n### High-Level Collabs AKA ‚ÄúLeads‚Äù\\n\\nFor Crowd-Tasking projects we create small groups headed by a Lead with a strong grasp of the task at hand. Leads will usually run groups for:\\n\\n* Web Development\\n* Design and Illustration\\n* Social Media Management\\n* [Online Assembly](https://mirror.xyz/0xe2A039aB83dB1ea76842FEc23611806d50C4B4Ae/YHiCb5_XaYGdpbRypQWQkl09ptcQ-gQ4z3xVB_ChbDc) - (Community Moderators)\\n* The Dark Room **\\\\[Link needed\\\\]**- (Photography)\\n\\n## Apply as an IRL Collaborator\\n\\n### Managers\\n\\nThis requires a high level of commitment.
