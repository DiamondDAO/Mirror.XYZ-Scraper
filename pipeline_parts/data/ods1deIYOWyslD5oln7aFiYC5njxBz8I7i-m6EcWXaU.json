"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The British territory Gibraltar stock exchange has received a takeover offer from a blockchain company called valereum. The Gibraltar based company will seek to acquire 80% of the shares of the above-mentioned exchanges, and its actual owner, the global stock exchange group, will retain 20% of the shares of the company. If effective, it could make the Gibraltar stock exchange the first exchange to trade cryptocurrencies and stocks. Regulators are currently reviewing this proposal. The two companies signed the option of the acquisition as early as October, and the company announced its intention to complete the transaction. However, the details of the acquisition have not been released to the public. The report also said that if the transaction passes, the group will seek to integrate cryptocurrencies into the exchange.\",\"timestamp\":1641117861,\"title\":\"Blockchain information\"},\"digest\":\"Xa7_legU6zWy67-DExZLa2i67uwDepb28hjFwb_vx4U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2dAEA6B39c2A34AbAaCE3F4c265f3C9377D37d81\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Pw3bdh6YyszsHFAqGMRac1xWHZ4JUpWvqF2iIrdGvFA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1CiqkHHlWWmdUy4CUpwAoFhiDT_hX1t3E7D3LagkCVk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6AF3lz8T2-JJmRtnwOquyWtVMFXG5kmkQV0ujpMupgxGBD_iLfa6mV3hLZBSrDIShKVpNp9JhlsQbs-lHrwnJA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa1afc536804bef8ec733794b70db735f17cdae162ab8d2417aa6cea3acb546444b6e252240bac6d2d271bc1a812e0ef8c57c84219651a423c6c843954df7135b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Pw3bdh6YyszsHFAqGMRac1xWHZ4JUpWvqF2iIrdGvFA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1CiqkHHlWWmdUy4CUpwAoFhiDT_hX1t3E7D3LagkCVk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Xa7_legU6zWy67-DExZLa2i67uwDepb28hjFwb_vx4U\"}"
