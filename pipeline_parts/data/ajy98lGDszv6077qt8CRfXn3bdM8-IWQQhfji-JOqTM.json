"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"ã€€Living close to the outdoors is fun, especially for city people. Most people who go camping want to be entirely on their own. Some want to fish or to hunt. Some want to hike, ride horseback, swim, or go canoeing. The question of where to go is the first priority. A good rule about clothing is that it should be comfortable and not easily torn. Food should be the kinds that will not spoil easily. A good camper always carries a compass and no camper should be without a first-aid kit. Many new inventions make camping easier. There are boats that are very light in weight. There are tents that can be opened up like umbrellas, mattresses that can be blown up like balloons, and sleeping bags that make blankets unnecessary.\",\"timestamp\":1638953805,\"title\":\"Camping\"},\"digest\":\"ks_mhn89dgyhhHbTFqOK40tWbL9IiM7H_mJdXnmfq3Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x46305dD25e454087F843730aFC47eB3cAcB6264f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i99vYRmyvH6xCh5m007wiX7EnmKYzg--nWLDfuzOqfU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X7aWppdHBpB_wA0I_Dh1WwTQxLQ9caqIvy4mxcPteCM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3nDJ_kOPQwgIzevPhfoF-eA3rmDIyLwUxc3s_6bu8cPci-SN48oKQyhRKH2djO45jzP4ovFs2tKF_ekuv73CuA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xddb291467f929b5fbb3ef7ee0efcc79f9c085522cfc94a725dbc12d85b0608a92e8eb871c17d50319662d8e943d6989073173338775de6fc31e8e0d485f7dded1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"i99vYRmyvH6xCh5m007wiX7EnmKYzg--nWLDfuzOqfU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X7aWppdHBpB_wA0I_Dh1WwTQxLQ9caqIvy4mxcPteCM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ks_mhn89dgyhhHbTFqOK40tWbL9IiM7H_mJdXnmfq3Q\"}"
