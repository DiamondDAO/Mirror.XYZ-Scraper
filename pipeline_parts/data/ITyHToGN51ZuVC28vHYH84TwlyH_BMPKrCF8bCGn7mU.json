"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"How to talk Decentralized Finance, [#DeFi](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DeFi?src=hashtag_click), like a Pro. \\n\\nA Thread\\n\\n1/ What is Decentralized finance (DeFi)?\\n\\n* A global, open alternative to the current financial system.\\n* Products that let you borrow, save, invest, trade, and more.\\n* Based on open-source technology that anyone can program with.\\n* Can be KYC-less.\\n\\n  2/ DeFi is a collective term for financial products and services run on Ethereum or other blockchains, executed with DApps.\\n\\nIn DeFi, a smart contract replaces the financial institution in the transaction. Contracts are transparency to inspect and audit by anyone.\\n\\n3/ Difference between #DeFi and Traditional Finance (TradFi)\\n\\nInfographic:\\n\\n![DeFi vs TradeFi](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/H6y5yjdowpsk1WwUrx18Y.jpeg?height=1350&width=2400)\\n\\n4/ DeFi in Layers (Ethereum)\\n\\ni. The blockchain – Ethereum contains the transaction history and state of accounts\\n\\nii. The assets – ETH and the other tokens (currencies)\\n\\niii. The protocols – Smart contracts that provide the functionality.\\n\\niv. The applications – the products\\n\\n\\n5/ What can you do with DeFi?\\n\\n* Send money around the globe\\n* Stream money around the globe\\n* Access stable currencies\\n* Borrow funds with or without collateral\\n* Start crypto savings\\n* Trade tokens\\n* Grow your portfolio\\n* Fund your ideas\\n* Buy insurance\\n* Manage your portfolio\\n\\n  \\n  6/ Payments:\\n\\nDeFi makes sending/streaming money around the globe as fast as sending an email. (Tornado, Sablier)\\n\\n\\n7/ / Lending and Borrowing:\\n\\nYou can earn interest on your crypto through lending. Decentralized lending works without either party having to identify themselves. Borrowing money from decentralized providers comes in two main varieties (peer-to-peer, pool-based) (Aave, Compound)\\n\\n\\n8/ Token Swaps:\\n\\nDecentralized exchanges (DEXs) let you trade different tokens 24/7. (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Curve).\\n\\n\\n9/ Stable Currencies:\\n\\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies without the volatility. How stablecoins get their stability (USDC, DAI)\\n\\n\\n10/ Advanced Trading and Prediction Markets:\\n\\nPolymarket (prediction), Augur (prediction), dYdX (margin trading)\\n\\n11/ Investments/Asset Management: Yearn, Set Protocol\\n\\n12/ Crowdfunding: Quadratic funding is the mathematically optimal way to fund public goods in a democratic community.\\n\\n13/ Liquidity Pools: One of the foundational technologies behind the current DeFi ecosystem. A liquidity pool is a collection of funds locked in a smart contract. Liquidity pools are used to facilitate decentralized trading, lending, etc.\\n\\n14/ Liquidity pools are also the backbone of many decentralized exchanges (DEX). Users called liquidity providers (LP) add an equal value of two tokens in a pool to create a market. In exchange for providing their funds, they earn trading fees from the trades that happen in pool.\\n\\n15/ Yield Farming is a specific use case of liquidity pools. Yield farming, also referred to as liquidity mining, is a way to generate rewards with cryptocurrency holdings by investing and/or lending it.\\n\\n16/ Total Value Locked (TVL): TVL represents the number of assets that are currently being staked in a specific protocol, the total amount of underlying supply that is being secured by a specific application by DeFi completely.\\n\\n17/ Total value locked is a metric that is used to measure the overall health of the DeFi and yielding market.\\n\\n18/ Rug Pull: A rug pull is where crypto developers abandon a project and run away with investors’ funds, leaving them “rugged.”\\n\\n19/ Miner Extractable Value (MEV): the measure of the profit a miner can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce; miners can exploit and profit from front-running, back-running and sandwiching transaction.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\nIf you enjoyed it you can check some other Threads too.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1447492904730116096](https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1447492904730116096)\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://twitter.com/EtherSiim/status/1448857553077739521/photo/1)\",\"timestamp\":1638389747,\"title\":\"How to talk #DeFi like a Pro\"},\"digest\":\"DosNzj4d52NNPPzZc1fk2CTgAdbIxpQeMOOihxtwTTQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b3791AD79aCc2F412b25De89F00cfDa594f2625\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4nHyiFi9PhmMLCR5sUQF9_WDideZ9jEXb4nVBuh5Bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1RJ68OZFPDOvDVdeek1AWV4QOoLPMdVzaCxfskqaTvg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qVBpj11hlHzWBpIkRRrSBVkJQaSbthpjU4ImiqOr_p--uMj0moKOlklSPQxcbNZu4hkIlvM8ysjQi8R50DRCdA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd6f819f49157ab9155434a79d48ebbad555f89acb6062707d311f90dcc253d715e9fa0af7f14f0ae52be761c251ff6110db2e138e515a27528eeb5b3da429b8d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B4nHyiFi9PhmMLCR5sUQF9_WDideZ9jEXb4nVBuh5Bo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1RJ68OZFPDOvDVdeek1AWV4QOoLPMdVzaCxfskqaTvg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DosNzj4d52NNPPzZc1fk2CTgAdbIxpQeMOOihxtwTTQ\"}"
