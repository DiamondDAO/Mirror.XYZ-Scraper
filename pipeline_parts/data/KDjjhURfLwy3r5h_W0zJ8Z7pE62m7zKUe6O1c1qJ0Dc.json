"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are many algorithmic stablecoins out there, such as Terra USD, Ampleforth, etc. In your opinion, what makes Frax unique?\\n\\n**Sam Kazemian:**Â What makes Frax unique is that we have a system where our protocol expands and contracts supply in various places across blockchain protocols, and targets the exchange rates of the Frax stablecoin out in the open market. We like to compare it to a central bank. When it issues a currency, it never says 'hey, you can come to redeem it for this amount of gold, or you can come and redeem it at the central bank for something dollar-pegged.' They don't say that anymore. And so, what a central bank does, is that it targets their currency in the open market's exchange rate.\\n\\nIf a central bank pegs their currency to gold, what they'll do is look at the price of gold against their national currency. If it's lower than what they want, they'll buy some of the currency back. If the other side is higher than what they want, then they'll print more of the currency. Frax takes this kind of approach. That's how we developed our algorithmic stablecoin thesis, and it's worked well. We've never broken our peg, even during \\\\[the major market crash in\\\\] May.\",\"timestamp\":1639039753,\"title\":\"There are many algorithmic stablecoins\"},\"digest\":\"QxFEgd9fpINrWzfq81jA1j9tS9fvaYpusD3H9CuM0ZI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9bdDD0B5b1A155C24Ab719491E82E14535dA9Df7\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2MFeThc5IObk_gvETIOlyiaCKSKQb3ZKlgAoRgk--x0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yv5uLUcl2jU79rqPAEG603BYKFEPUf-dVgsqGLFRX64\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9sbtoC6_xmTSF2SW67llroe8iifhMQTy_U28GqUmigUrUuOiDXbUEim87EgwGYPnmxrhCOoOboaUWZFBIkHtZg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x028c58dfec85528da3d7648f751ecfe32250fc35fe6401b8ffe0ee6e9a92080d6de31c7ba5b53f8de22f3d342c664ff4481375286f4c9fade8e6774a91bf7b571b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2MFeThc5IObk_gvETIOlyiaCKSKQb3ZKlgAoRgk--x0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Yv5uLUcl2jU79rqPAEG603BYKFEPUf-dVgsqGLFRX64\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"QxFEgd9fpINrWzfq81jA1j9tS9fvaYpusD3H9CuM0ZI\"}"
