"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you read the first post about Blergs, there are some changes ahead. TLDR, [Shiny Object Social Club](https://shinyobjects.gg/) announced some things a few days after I published it that really hit on the “let’s sort through this web3 information overload and incentivize people to find and curate it”. They’re the reason I got into this space, the community there is fantastic, and I’d encourage anyone who vibed with the goals of that first post to join that group. It’s gonna make it.\\n\\nNow.\\n\\nAbout Blergs.\\n\\nI started this project to just see what this space was all about. I had no plans, I didn’t even think it would ever make it outside of the Figma file. But the more I made, the more fun I had. The more I shared, the more I realized that it was something others vibed with.\\n\\nBut.\\n\\nI didn’t want to make something at all like the mess of hype-n-pump-n-dump projects that are out there. I didn’t want to make *another* PFP project and claim that people were in it “just for the art”. I didn’t want to try to convince anyone to buy a jpeg if they didn’t want to.\\n\\nI wanted to learn about the space, and have fun doing that. So far, that’s exactly what I’ve done. But now let’s talk about what Blergs is going to be, or at least what the plans are for now. Yes, this is kindof a roadmap, but more-so, it’s the distillation of a dozen different Discord chats and threads I’ve been having over the last week. It’s my goal, but goals change with new information. \\n\\nSo. Here we go.\\n\\n## Phase 1 - The Blerginning\\n\\nI’ve paid close attention to the NFT launches that have happened over the last few months. Some have made it big, some have never sold out, and some have pumped and then dumped.\\n\\nThe ones that started from relatively unknown or new teams, and that were able to not fade into obscurity, are ones that started with a low-volume Genesis run. Something to test the waters. Chubbicorns, Stimaes, Galactic Apes, all did early runs of art that were more curated. \\n\\nPhase 1 Blergs will be the same.\\n\\nThe Blerginning will be a small run of 420 PFPs. 69 of those Blerginners will have unique properties and will play a large role in the later part of the project. All of them will have benefits that will help in the later phases. \\n\\nMint price for the Blerginners project will be .1 ETH.\\n\\nThe goal of Phase 1 is to:\\n\\n* Validate that people like the art.\\n* Fund the ability to launch Phase 2, since a larger effort will be needed to make it happen.\\n* Make sure that we can launch properly, test out the tech to make it happen, and get the experience needed to navigate in more complex waters.\\n\\nLaunch date is TBD. This post will update when it’s announced.\\n\\n[Register here](https://www.premint.xyz/the-blerginning/)\\n\\n## Phase 2 - 1 Wallet = 1 Blerg\",\"timestamp\":1637960847,\"title\":\"1 Wallet = 1 Blerg\"},\"digest\":\"KKj99vLd0uQ6NLamk83khF_Obtb9mGNHZGHpaNz8q7M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6D8Df15FD3dC3505a4010CaC6937De159d68081C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vT_uN69kjZLlvs5-tpL1spLQBtGaH5Rd8gVMHrFn2Sk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C1kE2S8CqcBJlA0LJhPkri4D61sWR0SYYVmOk53QTuw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"WaGb5H97_eVMQ_6NLEXqAj4dkTMn0rlmRMubxVa28YqnB_i81g2y1yGMYS_O9si2n1uAp-3fkfD0KFfn_mBDMg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2cf2a9638f1f8159d89a25fe4925178cb8d1370278da4fe827afb7ba2f960b1318efdaf899cfda3a9a60661b81f18ecabc6fd8d87da5df6472e7cfe4d5079f401b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vT_uN69kjZLlvs5-tpL1spLQBtGaH5Rd8gVMHrFn2Sk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"C1kE2S8CqcBJlA0LJhPkri4D61sWR0SYYVmOk53QTuw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KKj99vLd0uQ6NLamk83khF_Obtb9mGNHZGHpaNz8q7M\"}"
