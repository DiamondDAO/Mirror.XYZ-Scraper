"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"the\\neditions of the Elzevirs have been in demand.  The fancy for them\\nhas even penetrated into the country.  I am acquainted with a man\\nthere who denies himself necessaries, for the sake of collecting\\ninto a library (where other books are scarce enough) as many little\\nElzevirs as he can lay his hands upon.  He is dying of hunger, and\\nhis consolation is to be able to say, 'I have all the poets whom the\\nElzevirs printed.  I have ten examples of each of them, all with red\\nletters, and all of the right date.'  This, no doubt, is a craze,\\nfor, good as the books are, if he kept them to read them, one\\nexample of each would be enough.\\\"\\n\\nThe Parisian.  \\\"If he had wanted to read them, I would not have\\nadvised him to buy Elzevirs.  The editions of minor authors which\\nthese booksellers published, even editions 'of the right date,' as\\nyou say, are not too correct.  Nothing is good in the books but the\\ntype and the paper.  Your friend would have done better to use the\\neditions of Gryphius or Estienne.\\\"\\n\\nThis fragment of a literary dialogue I translate from 'Entretiens\\nsur les Contes de Fees,' a book which contains more of old talk\\nabout books and booksellers than about fairies and folk-lore.  The\\n'Entretiens' were published in 1699, about sixteen years after the\\nElzevirs ceased to be publishers.  The fragment is valuable:  first,\\nbecause it shows us how early the taste for collecting Elzevirs was\\nfully developed, and, secondly, because it contains very sound\\ncriticism of the mania.  Already, in the seventeenth century, lovers\\nof the tiny Elzevirian books waxed pathetic over dates, already they\\nknew that a 'Caesar' of 1635 was the right 'Caesar,' already they\\nwere fond of the red-lettered passages, as in the first edition of\\nthe 'Virgil' of 1636.  As early as 1699, too, the Parisian critic\\nknew that the editions were not very correct, and that the paper,\\ntype, ornaments, and FORMAT were their main attractions.  To these\\nwe must now add the rarity of really good Elzevirs.\\n\\nThough Elzevirs have been more fashionable than at present, they are\\nstill regarded by novelists as the great prize of the book\\ncollector.  You read in novels about \\\"priceless little Elzevirs,\\\"\\nabout books \\\"as rare as an old Elzevir.\\\"  I have met, in the works\\nof a lady novelist (but not elsewhere), with an Elzevir\\n'Theocritus.'  The late Mr. Hepworth Dixon introduced into one of\\nhis romances a romantic Elzevir Greek Testament, \\\"worth its weight\\nin gold.\\\"  Casual remarks of this kind encourage a popular delusion\\nthat all Elzevirs are pearls of considerable price.  When a man is\\nfirst smitten with the pleasant fever of book-collecting, it is for\\nElzevirs that he searches.  At first he thinks himself in amazing\\nluck.  In Booksellers' Row and in Castle Street he \\\"picks up,\\\" for a\\nshilling or two, Elzevirs, real or supposed.  To the beginner, any\\nbook with a sphere on the title-page is an Elzevir.  For the\\nbeginner's instruction, two copies of spheres are printed here.  The\\nsecond is a sphere, an ill-cut, ill-drawn sphere, which is not\\nElzevirian at all.  The mark was used in the seventeenth century by\\nmany other booksellers and printers.  The first, on the other hand,\\nis a true Elzevirian sphere, from a play of Moliere's, printed in\\n1675\\\\.  Observe the comparatively neat drawing of the first sphere,\\nand be not led away after spurious imitations.\\n\\nBeware, too, of the vulgar error of fancying that little duodecimos\\nwith the mark of the fox and the bee's nest, and the motto\\n\\\"Quaerendo,\\\" come from the press of the Elzevirs.  The mark is that\\nof Abraham Wolfgang, which name is not a pseudonym for Elzevir.\\nThere are three sorts of Elzevir pseudonyms.  First, they\\noccasionally reprinted the full title-page, publisher's name and\\nall, of the book they pirated.  Secondly, when they printed books of\\na \\\"dangerous\\\" sort, Jansenist pamphlets and so forth, they used\\npseudonyms like \\\"Nic. Schouter,\\\" on the 'Lettres Provinciales' of\\nPascal.  Thirdly, there are real pseudonyms employed by the\\nElzevirs.  John and Daniel, printing at Leyden (1652-1655), used the\\nfalse name \\\"Jean Sambix.\\\"  The Elzevirs of Amsterdam often placed\\nthe name \\\"Jacques le Jeune\\\" on their title-pages.  The collector who\\nremembers these things must also see that his purchases have the\\nright ornaments at the heads of chapters, the right tail-pieces at\\nthe ends.  Two of the most frequently recurring ornaments are the\\nso-called \\\"Tete de Buffle\\\" and the \\\"Sirene.\\\"  More or less clumsy\\ncopies of these and the other Elzevirian ornaments are common enough\\nin books of the period, even among those printed out of the Low\\nCountries; for example, in books published in Paris.\\n\\nA brief sketch of the history of the Elzevirs may here be useful.\\nThe founder of the family, a Flemish bookbinder, Louis, left Louvain\\nand settled in Leyden in 1580.  He bought a house opposite the\\nUniversity, and opened a book-shop.  Another shop, on college\\nground, was opened in 1587.  Louis was a good bookseller, a very\\nordinary publisher.  It was not till shortly before his death, in\\n1617, that his grandson Isaac bought a set of types and other\\nmaterial.  Louis left six sons.  Two of these, Matthew and\\nBonaventure, kept on the business, dating ex officina Elzeviriana.\\nIn 1625 Bonaventure and Abraham (son of Matthew) became partners.\\nThe \\\"good dates\\\" of Elzevirian books begin from 1626.  The two\\nElzevirs chose excellent types, and after nine years' endeavours\\nturned out the beautiful 'Caesar' of 1635.\\n\\nTheir classical series in petit format was opened with 'Horace' and\\n'Ovid' in 1629.  In 1641 they began their elegant piracies of French\\nplays and poetry with 'Le Cid.'  It was worth while being pirated by\\nthe Elzevirs, who turned you out like a gentleman, with fleurons and\\nred letters, and a pretty frontispiece.  The modern pirate dresses\\nyou in rags, prints you murderously, and binds you, if he binds you\\nat all, in some hideous example of \\\"cloth extra,\\\" all gilt, like\\narchaic gingerbread.  Bonaventure and Abraham both died in 1652.\\nThey did not depart before publishing (1628), in grand format, a\\ndesirable work on fencing, Thibault's 'Academie de l'Espee.'  This\\nTibbald also killed by the book.  John and Daniel Elzevir came next.\\nThey brought out the 'Imitation' (Thomae a Kempis canonici regularis\\nord.  S. Augustini De Imitatione Christi, libri iv.); I wish by\\ntaking thought I could add eight millimetres to the stature of my\\ncopy.  In 1655 Daniel joined a cousin, Louis, in Amsterdam, and John\\nstayed in Leyden.  John died in 1661; his widow struggled on, but\\nher son Abraham (1681) let all fall into ruins.  Abraham died 1712.\\nThe Elzevirs of Amsterdam lasted till 1680, when Daniel died, and\\nthe business was wound up.  The type, by Christopher Van Dyck, was\\nsold in 1681, by Daniel's widow.  Sic transit gloria.\\n\\nAfter he has learned all these matters the amateur has still a great\\ndeal to acquire.  He may now know a real Elzevir from a book which\\nis not an Elzevir at all.  But there are enormous differences of\\nvalue, rarity, and excellence among the productions of the\\nElzevirian press.  The bookstalls teem with small, \\\"cropped,\\\" dingy,\\ndirty, battered Elzevirian editions of the classics, NOT \\\"of the\\ngood date.\\\"  On these it is not worth while to expend a couple of\\nshillings, especially as Elzevirian type is too small to be read\\nwith comfort by most modern eyes.  No, let the collector save his\\nmoney; avoid littering his shelves with what he will soon find to be\\nrubbish, and let him wait the chance of acquiring a really beautiful\\nand rare Elzevir.\\n\\nMeantime, and before we come to describe Elzevirs of the first\\nflight, let it be remembered that the \\\"taller\\\" the copy, the less\\nharmed and nipped by the binder's shears, the better.  \\\"Men scarcely\\nknow how beautiful fire is,\\\" says Shelley; and we may say that most\\nmen hardly know how beautiful an Elzevir was in its uncut and\\noriginal form.  The Elzevirs we have may be \\\"dear,\\\" but they are\\ncertainly \\\"dumpy twelves.\\\"  Their fair proportions have been docked\\nby the binder.  At the Beckford sale there was a pearl of a book, a\\n'Marot;' not an Elzevir, indeed, but a book published by Wetstein, a\\nfollower of the Elzevirs.  This exquisite pair of volumes, bound in\\nblue morocco, was absolutely unimpaired, and was a sight to bring\\nhappy tears into the eyes of the amateur of Elzevirs.  There was a\\ngracious svelte elegance about these tomes, an appealing and\\nexquisite delicacy of proportion, that linger like sweet music in\\nthe memory.  I have a copy of the Wetstein 'Marot' myself, not a bad\\ncopy, though murderously bound in that ecclesiastical sort of brown\\ncalf antique, which goes well with hymn books, and reminds one of\\ncakes of chocolate.  But my copy is only some 128 millimetres in\\nheight, whereas the uncut Beckford copy (it had belonged to the\\ngreat Pixerecourt) was at least 130 millimetres high.  Beside the\\nuncut example mine looks like Cinderella's plain sister beside the\\nbeauty of the family.\\n\\nNow the moral is that only tall Elzevirs are beautiful, only tall\\nElzevirs preserve their ancient proportions, only tall Elzevirs are\\nworth collecting.  Dr. Lemuel Gulliver remarks that the King of\\nLilliput was taller than any of his court by almost the breadth of a\\nnail, and that his altitude filled the minds of all with awe.  Well,\\nthe Philistine may think a few millimetres, more or less, in the\\nheight of an Elzevir are of little importance.  When he comes to\\nsell, he will discover the difference.  An uncut, or almost uncut,\\ncopy of a good Elzevir may be worth fifty or sixty pounds or more;\\nan ordinary copy may bring fewer pence.  The binders usually pare\\ndown the top and bottom more than the sides.  I have a 'Rabelais' of\\nthe good date, with the red title (1663), and some of the pages have\\nnever been opened, at the sides.  But the height is only some 122\\nmillimetres, a mere dwarf.  Anything over 130 millimetres is very\\nrare.  Therefore the collector of Elzevirs should have one of those\\nuseful ivory-handled knives on which the French measures are marked,\\nand thus he will at once be able to satisfy himself as to the exact\\nheight of any example which he encounters.\\n\\nLet us now assume that the amateur quite understands what a proper\\nElzevir should be:  tall, clean, well bound if possible, and of the\\ngood date.  But we have still to learn what the good dates are, and\\nthis is matter for the study and practice of a well-spent life.  We\\nmay gossip about a few of the more famous Elzevirs, those without\\nwhich no collection is complete.  Of all Elzevirs the most famous\\nand the most expensive is an old cookery book, \\\"'Le Pastissier\\nFrancois.'  Wherein is taught the way to make all sorts of pastry,\\nuseful to all sorts of persons.  Also the manner of preparing all\\nmanner of eggs, for fast-days, and other days, in more than sixty\\nfashions.  Amsterdam, Louys, and Daniel Elsevier. 1665.\\\"  The mark\\nis not the old \\\"Sage,\\\" but the \\\"Minerva\\\" with her owl.  Now this\\nbook has no intrinsic value any more than a Tauchnitz reprint of any\\nmodern volume on cooking.  The 'Pastissier' is cherished because it\\nis so very rare.  The tract passed into the hands of cooks, and the\\nhands of cooks are detrimental to literature.  Just as nursery\\nbooks, fairy tales, and the like are destroyed from generation to\\ngeneration, so it happens with books used in the kitchen.  The\\n'Pastissier,' to be sure, has a good frontispiece, a scene in a Low\\nCountry kitchen, among the dead game and the dainties.  The buxom\\ncook is making a game pie; a pheasant pie, decorated with the bird's\\nhead and tail-feathers, is already made. {1}\\n\\nNot for these charms, but for its rarity, is the 'Pastissier'\\ncoveted.  In an early edition of the 'Manuel' (1821) Brunet says,\\nwith a feigned brutality (for he dearly loved an Elzevir), \\\"Till now\\nI have disdained to admit this book into my work, but I have yielded\\nto the prayers of amateurs.  Besides, how could I keep out a volume\\nwhich was sold for one hundred and one francs in 1819?\\\"  One hundred\\nand one francs!  If I could only get a 'Pastissier' for one hundred\\nand one francs!  But our grandfathers lived in the Bookman's\\nParadise.  \\\"Il n'est pas jusqu'aux Anglais,\\\" adds Brunet--\\\"the very\\nEnglish themselves--have a taste for the 'Pastissier.'\\\"  The Duke of\\nMarlborough's copy was actually sold for 1 pound 4s.  It would have\\nbeen money in the ducal pockets of the house of Marlborough to have\\nkept this volume till the general sale of all their portable\\nproperty at which our generation is privileged to assist.  No wonder\\nthe 'Pastissier' was thought rare.  Berard only knew two copies.\\nPietiers, writing on the Elzevirs in 1843, could cite only five\\n'Pastissiers,' and in his 'Annales' he had found out but five more.\\nWillems, on the other hand, enumerates some thirty, not including\\nMotteley's.  Motteley was an uncultivated, untaught enthusiast.  He\\nknew no Latin, but he had a FLAIR for uncut Elzevirs.  \\\"Incomptis\\ncapillis,\\\" he would cry (it was all his lore) as he gloated over his\\ntreasures.  They were all burnt by the Commune in the Louvre\\nLibrary.\\n\\nA few examples may be given of the prices brought by 'Le Pastissier'\\nin later days.  Sensier's copy was but 128 millimetres in height,\\nand had the old ordinary vellum binding,--in fact, it closely\\nresembled a copy which Messrs. Ellis and White had for sale in Bond\\nStreet in 1883.  The English booksellers asked, I think, about 1,500\\nfrancs for their copy.  Sensier's was sold for 128 francs in April,\\n1828; for 201 francs in 1837.  Then the book was gloriously bound by\\nTrautz-Bauzonnet, and was sold with Potier's books in 1870, when it\\nfetched 2,910 francs.  At the Benzon sale (1875) it fetched 3,255\\nfrancs, and, falling dreadfully in price, was sold again in 1877 for\\n2,200 francs.  M. Dutuit, at Rouen, has a taller copy, bound by\\nBauzonnet.  Last time it was sold (1851) it brought 251 francs.  The\\nDuc de Chartres has now the copy of Pieters, the historian of the\\nElzevirs, valued at 3,000 francs.\\n\\nAbout thirty years ago no fewer than three copies were sold at\\nBrighton, of all places.  M. Quentin Bauchart had a copy only 127\\nmillimetres in height, which he swopped to M. Paillet.  M.\\nChartener, of Metz, had a copy now bound by Bauzonnet which was sold\\nfor four francs in 1780.  We call this the age of cheap books, but\\nbefore the Revolution books were cheaper.  It is fair to say,\\nhowever, that this example of the 'Pastissier' was then bound up\\nwith another book, Vlacq's edition of 'Le Cuisinier Francois,' and\\nso went cheaper than it would otherwise have done.  M. de Fontaine\\nde Resbecq declares that a friend of his bought six original pieces\\nof Moliere's bound up with an old French translation of Garth's\\n'Dispensary.'  The one faint hope left to the poor book collector is\\nthat he may find a valuable tract lurking in the leaves of some\\nbound collection of trash.  I have an original copy of Moliere's\\n'Les Fascheux' bound up with a treatise on precious stones, but the\\nbookseller from whom I bought it knew it was there!  That made all\\nthe difference.\\n\\nBut, to return to our 'Pastissier,' here is M. de Fontaine de\\nResbecq's account of how he wooed and won his own copy of this\\nillustrious Elzevir.  \\\"I began my walk to-day,\\\" says this haunter of\\nancient stalls, \\\"by the Pont Marie and the Quai de la Greve, the\\npillars of Hercules of the book-hunting world.  After having viewed\\nand reviewed these remote books, I was going away, when my attention\\nwas caught by a small naked volume, without a stitch of binding.  I\\nseized it, and what was my delight when I recognised one of the\\nrarest of that famed Elzevir collection whose height is measured as\\nminutely as the carats of the diamond.  There was no indication of\\nprice on the box where this jewel was lying; the book, though\\nunbound, was perfectly clean within.  'How much?' said I to the\\nbookseller.  'You can have it for six sous,' he answered; 'is it too\\nmuch?'  'No,' said I, and, trembling a little, I handed him the\\nthirty centimes he asked for the 'Pastissier Francois.'  You may\\nbelieve, my friend, that after such a piece of luck at the start,\\none goes home fondly embracing the beloved object of one's search.\\nThat is exactly what I did.\\\"\\n\\nCan this tale be true?  Is such luck given by the jealous fates\\nmortalibus aegris?  M. de Resbecq's find was made apparently in\\n1856, when trout were plenty in the streams, and rare books not so\\nvery rare.  To my own knowledge an English collector has bought an\\noriginal play of Moliere's, in the original vellum, for\\neighteenpence.  But no one has such luck any longer.  Not, at least,\\nin London.  A more expensive 'Pastissier' than that which brought\\nsix sous was priced in Bachelin-Deflorenne's catalogue at 240\\npounds.  A curious thing occurred when two uncut 'Pastissiers'\\nturned up simultaneously in Paris.  One of them Morgand and Fatout\\nsold for 400 pounds.  Clever people argued that one of the twin\\nuncut 'Pastissiers' must be an imitation, a facsimile by means of\\nphotogravure, or some other process.  But it was triumphantly\\nestablished that both were genuine; they had minute points of\\ndifference in the ornaments.\\n\\nM. Willems, the learned historian of the Elzevirs, is indignant at\\nthe successes of a book which, as Brunet declares, is badly printed.\\nThere must be at least forty known 'Pastissiers' in the world.  Yes;\\nbut there are at least 4,000 people who would greatly rejoice to\\npossess a 'Pastissier,' and some of these desirous ones are very\\nwealthy.  While this state of the market endures, the 'Pastissier'\\nwill fetch higher prices than the other varieties.  Another\\nextremely rare Elzevir is 'L'Illustre Theatre de Mons. Corneille'\\n(Leyden, 1644).  This contains 'Le Cid,' 'Les Horaces,' 'Le Cinna,'\\n'La Mort de Pompee,' 'Le Polyeucte.'  The name, 'L'Illustre\\nTheatre,' appearing at that date has an interest of its own.  In\\n1643-44, Moliere and Madeleine Bejart had just started the company\\nwhich they called 'L'Illustre Theatre.'  Only six or seven copies of\\nthe book are actually known, though three or four are believed to\\nexist in England, probably all covered with dust in the library of\\nsome lord.  \\\"He has a very good library,\\\" I once heard some one say\\nto a noble earl, whose own library was famous.  \\\"And what can a\\nfellow do with a very good library?\\\" answered the descendant of the\\nCrusaders, who probably (being a youth light-hearted and content)\\nwas ignorant of his own great possessions.  An expensive copy of\\n'L'Illustre Theatre,' bound by Trautz-Bauzonnet, was sold for 300\\npounds.\\n\\nAmong Elzevirs desirable, yet not hopelessly rare, is the 'Virgil'\\nof 1636.  Heinsius was the editor of this beautiful volume, prettily\\nprinted, but incorrect.  Probably it is hard to correct with\\nabsolute accuracy works in the clear but minute type which the\\nElzevirs affected.  They have won fame by the elegance of their\\nbooks, but their intention was to sell good books cheap, like Michel\\nLevy.  The small type was required to get plenty of \\\"copy\\\" into\\nlittle bulk.  Nicholas Heinsius, the son of the editor of the\\n'Virgil,' when he came to correct his father's edition, found that\\nit contained so many coquilles, or misprints, as to be nearly the\\nmost incorrect copy in the world.  Heyne says, \\\"Let the 'Virgil' be\\none of the rare Elzevirs, if you please, but within it has scarcely\\na trace of any good quality.\\\"  Yet the first edition of this\\nbeautiful little book, with its two passages of red letters, is so\\ndesirable that, till he could possess it, Charles Nodier would not\\nprofane his shelves by any 'Virgil' at all.\\n\\nEqually fine is the 'Caesar' of 1635, which, with the 'Virgil' of\\n1636 and the 'Imitation' without date, M. Willems thinks the most\\nsuccessful works of the Elzevirs, \\\"one of the most enviable jewels\\nin the casket of the bibliophile.\\\"  It may be recognised by the page\\n238, which is erroneously printed 248.  A good average height is\\nfrom 125 to 128 millimetres.  The highest known is 130 millimetres.\\nThis book, like the 'Imitation,' has one of the pretty and ingenious\\nfrontispieces which the Elzevirs prefixed to their books.  So\\nfarewell, and good speed in your sport, ye hunters of Elzevirs, and\\nmay you find perhaps the rarest Elzevir of all, 'L'Aimable Mere de\\nJesus.'\\n\\nBALLADE OF THE REAL AND IDEAL (DOUBLE REFRAIN)\\n\\nO visions of salmon tremendous,\\nOf trout of unusual weight,\\nOf waters that wander as Ken does,\\nYe come through the Ivory Gate!\\nBut the skies that bring never a \\\"spate,\\\"\\nBut the flies that catch up in a thorn,\\nBut the creel that is barren of freight,\\nThrough the portals of horn!\\n\\nO dreams of the Fates that attend us\\nWith prints in the earliest state,\\nO bargains in books that they send us,\\nYe come through the Ivory Gate!\\nBut the tome that has never a mate,\\nBut the quarto that's tattered and torn,\\nAnd bereft of a title and date,\\nThrough the portals of horn!\\n\\nO dreams of the tongues that commend us,\\nOf crowns for the laureate pate,\\nOf a public to buy and befriend us,\\nYe come through the Ivory Gate!\\nBut the critics that slash us and slate, {2}\\nBut the people that hold us in scorn,\\nBut the sorrow, the scathe, and the hate,\\nThrough the portals of horn!\\n\\nENVOY.\\n\\nFair dreams of things golden and great,\\nYe come through the Ivory Gate;\\nBut the facts that are bleak and forlorn,\\nThrough the portals of horn!\\n\\nCURIOSITIES OF PARISH REGISTERS\\n\\nThere are three classes of persons who are deeply concerned with\\nparish registers--namely, villains, antiquaries, and the sedulous\\nreaders, \\\"parish clerks and others,\\\" of the second or \\\"agony\\\" column\\nof the Times.  Villains are probably the most numerous of these\\nthree classes.  The villain of fiction dearly loves a parish\\nregister:  he cuts out pages, inserts others, intercalates remarks\\nin a different coloured ink, and generally manipulates the register\\nas a Greek manages his hand at ecarte, or as a Hebrew dealer in\\nMoabite bric-a-brac treats a synagogue roll.  We well remember one\\nvillain who had locked himself into the vestry (he was disguised as\\nan archaeologist), and who was enjoying his wicked pleasure with the\\nregister, when the vestry somehow caught fire, the rusty key would\\nnot turn in the door, and the villain was roasted alive, in spite of\\nthe disinterested efforts to save him made by all the virtuous\\ncharacters in the story.  Let the fate of this bold, bad man be a\\nwarning to wicked earls, baronets, and all others who attempt to\\ndestroy the record of the marriage of a hero's parents.  Fate will\\nbe too strong for them in the long run, though they bribe the parish\\nclerk, or carry off in white wax an impression of the keys of the\\nvestry and of the iron chest in which a register should repose.\\n\\nThere is another and more prosaic danger in the way of villains, if\\nthe new bill, entitled \\\"The Parish Registers Preservation Act,\\\" ever\\nbecomes law.  The bill provides that every register earlier than\\n1837 shall be committed to the care of the Master of the Rolls, and\\nremoved to the Record Office.  Now the common villain of fiction\\nwould feel sadly out of place in the Register Office, where a more\\nwatchful eye than that of a comic parish clerk would be kept on his\\nproceedings.  Villains and local antiquaries will, therefore, use\\nall their parliamentary influence to oppose and delay this bill,\\nwhich is certainly hard on the parish archaeologist.  The men who\\ngrub in their local registers, and slowly compile parish or county\\nhistory, deserve to be encouraged rather than depressed.  Mr.\\nChester Waters, therefore, has suggested that copies of registers\\nshould be made, and the comparatively legible copy left in the\\nparish, while the crabbed original is conveyed to the Record Office\\nin London.  Thus the local antiquary would really have his work made\\nmore easy for him (though it may be doubted whether he would quite\\nenjoy that condescension), while the villain of romance would be\\nfoiled; for it is useless (as a novel of Mr. Christie Murray's\\nproves) to alter the register in the keeping of the parish when the\\noriginal document is safe in the Record Office.  But previous\\nexamples of enforced transcription (as in 1603) do not encourage us\\nto suppose that the copies would be very scrupulously made.  Thus,\\nafter the Reformation, the prayers for the dead in the old registers\\nwere omitted by the copyist, who seemed to think (as the contractor\\nfor \\\"sandwich men\\\" said to the poor fellows who carried the letter\\nH), \\\"I don't want you, and the public don't want you, and you're no\\nuse to nobody.\\\"  Again, when Laurence Fletcher was buried in St.\\nSaviour's, Southwark, in 1608, the old register described him as \\\"a\\nplayer, the King's servant.\\\"  But the clerk, keeping a note-book,\\nsimply called Laurence Fletcher \\\"a man,\\\" and (in 1625) he also\\nstyled Mr. John Fletcher \\\"a man.\\\"  Now, the old register calls Mr.\\nJohn Fletcher \\\"a poet.\\\"  To copy all the parish registers in England\\nwould be a very serious task, and would probably be but slovenly\\nperformed.  If they were reproduced, again, by any process of\\nphotography, the old difficult court hand would remain as hard as\\never.  But this is a minor objection, for the local antiquary revels\\nin the old court hand.\\n\\nFrom the little volume by Mr. Chester Waters, already referred to\\n('Parish Registers in England;' printed for the author by F. J.\\nRoberts, Little Britain, E.C.), we proceed to appropriate such\\nmatters of curiosity as may interest minds neither parochial nor\\ndoggedly antiquarian.  Parish registers among the civilised peoples\\nof antiquity do not greatly concern us.  It seems certain that many\\nPolynesian races have managed to record (in verse, or by some rude\\nmarks) the genealogies of their chiefs through many hundreds of\\nyears.  These oral registers are accepted as fairly truthful by some\\nstudents, yet we must remember that Pindar supposed himself to\\npossess knowledge of at least twenty-five generations before his own\\ntime, and that only brought him up to the birth of Jason.  Nobody\\nbelieves in Jason and Medea, and possibly the genealogical records\\nof Maoris and Fijians are as little trustworthy as those of Pindaric\\nGreece.  However, to consider thus is to consider too curiously.  We\\nonly know for certain that genealogy very soon becomes important,\\nand, therefore, that records are early kept, in a growing\\ncivilisation.  \\\"After Nehemiah's return from the captivity in\\nBabylon, the priests at Jerusalem whose register was not found were\\nas polluted put from the priesthood.\\\"  Rome had her parish\\nregisters, which were kept in the temple of Saturn.  But modern\\nparish registers were \\\"discovered\\\" (like America) in 1497, when\\nCardinal Ximenes found it desirable to put on record the names of\\nthe godfathers and godmothers of baptised children.  When these\\nrelations of \\\"gossip,\\\" or God's kin (as the word literally means),\\nwere not certainly known, married persons could easily obtain\\ndivorces, by pretending previous spiritual relationship.\\n\\nBut it was only during the reign of Mary, (called the Bloody) that\\nthis rule of registering godfathers and godmothers prevailed in\\nEngland.  Henry VIII. introduced the custom of parish registers when\\nin a Protestant humour.  By the way, how curiously has Madame de\\nFlamareil (la femme de quarante ans, in Charles de Bernard's novel)\\nanticipated the verdict of Mr. Froude on Henry VIII.!  'On accuse\\nHenri VIII.,' dit Madame de Flamareil, \\\"moi je le comprends, et je\\nl'absous; c'etait un coeur genereux, lorsqu'il ne les aimait plus,\\nil les tuait.'\\\"  The public of England mistrusted, in the matter of\\nparish registers, the generous heart of Henry VIII.  It is the fixed\\nconviction of the public that all novelties in administration mean\\nnew taxes.  Thus the Croatian peasantry were once on the point of\\nrevolting because they imagined that they were to be taxed in\\nproportion to the length of their moustaches.  The English believed,\\nand the insurgents of the famous Pilgrimage of Grace declared, that\\nbaptism was to be refused to all children who did not pay a\\n\\\"trybette\\\" (tribute) to the king.  But Henry, or rather his\\nminister, Cromwell, stuck to his plan, and (September 29, 1538)\\nissued an injunction that a weekly register of weddings,\\nchristenings, and burials should be kept by the curate of every\\nparish.  The cost of the book (twopence in the case of St.\\nMargaret's, Westminster) was defrayed by the parishioners.  The\\noldest extant register books are those thus acquired in 1597 or\\n1603\\\\.  These volumes were of parchment, and entries were copied into\\nthem out of the old books on paper.  The copyists, as we have seen,\\nwere indolent, and omitted characteristic points in the more ancient\\nrecords.\\n\\nIn the civil war parish registers fell into some confusion, and when\\nthe clergy did make entries they commonly expressed their political\\nfeelings in a mixture of Latin and English.  Latin, by the way, went\\nout as Protestantism came in, but the curate of Rotherby, in\\nLeicestershire, writes, \\\"Bellum, Bellum, Bellum, interruption!\\npersecution!\\\"  At St. Bridget's, in Chester, is the quaint entry,\\n\\\"1643.  Here the register is defective till 1653.  The tymes were\\nSUCH!\\\"  At Hilton, in Dorset, William Snoke, minister, entered his\\nopinion that persons whose baptism and marriage were not registered\\n\\\"will be made uncapable of any earthly inheritance if they live.\\nThis I note for the satisfaction of any that do:\\\" though we may\\ndoubt whether these parishioners found the information thus conveyed\\nhighly satisfactory.\",\"timestamp\":1641284369,\"title\":\"\\nThe Countryman.  \\\"You know how much, for some time past\"},\"digest\":\"zRP5oO721-FdjbgYxfZEqERPs5bLiG0ZJ9kjo7gWOoI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x994E4477C12eEdA205e5484164bDb84f9649036F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uGquEsl9FS1U-F6DGnZs2JfqFjq4yM47rlAdN86L9rw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P8kLOmkT9kKe2RyHT7zOHxVLjGc9OpxLopc7Liw1tbI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_2kNz1lfRi58gQ47ewM4WIMMrJhbXN_PvdVAxb69bqTSu0p3Eu2q304cSLjGI7GyT6t-Vv6UjOgHXgPSfmilZA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xae8ad5f9fdd6781ccce9cb1c6c15ec6d43794a2a32f676519d2fbebd729544787d0c9c82ecdfe5af96ed5889f45346337b6a6d1a0edc18be1f6e35dccfbcfedc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uGquEsl9FS1U-F6DGnZs2JfqFjq4yM47rlAdN86L9rw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P8kLOmkT9kKe2RyHT7zOHxVLjGc9OpxLopc7Liw1tbI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zRP5oO721-FdjbgYxfZEqERPs5bLiG0ZJ9kjo7gWOoI\"}"
