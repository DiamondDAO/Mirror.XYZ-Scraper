"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"2021 would always be remembered as the break out year for crypto, with massive ecosystem growth, deep institutional interest, meteoric rise of DeFi, always peaking NFT hype cycle and crazy venture capital infatuation with ‘web3’\\n\\nCrypto has indisputably captured the public eye like never before and FUD from major  policy makers aside, the excitement that crypto drew from the  builder community and the accelerated venture activity that we saw in 2021, truly makes me believe we are now going to hit an infection point in 2022. \\n\\nCrypto Musings is a collection of my notes with an early stage investing lens that captures themes that I think about and which excite me from a venture building and investing perspective. First in this series is my thoughts on how to anchor oneself in crypto as an investor. \\n\\nAnd the reason first of this series comes on a 3rd of Jan is given the significance of that date for me as an exuberant and curious player in the casino of technology, It is on this day in 1977 when Apple computer was incorporated.\\n\\n## Why is crypto hard to keep up and what would it take to build mental models and get oriented ? \\n\\nWe are in times when shifts in the underlying mechanisms that determine economic behaviour, are going to shape the future of all commercial activity as we know it, and nothing has ever excited me more! \\n\\n> Venture building was never a game for the timid and light hearted, and in today’s crypto age it is imperative that all serious stakeholders continuously revisit and re-hash everything, everyday! \\n\\nWhat makes crypto super difficult to keep up with is that every layer of the crypto stack is moving, being built by 1000s of hackers and tinkerers and composability is what is getting solved for first before at scale end user utilities emerge, very unlike the world of web2! \\n\\nThere is really no one ‘canon’ one can go “catch up on” (there is of-course the [a16z crypto ‘canon’](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/) which is a set of good resources to at-least start off from if you are completely un-acquainted) \\n\\nBut If I was to draw from my experience of having been (what would qualify as) a ‘crypto native’, I can say that I’ve only been able to wrap my head around these fundamental-challenging concepts (they truly are) only by supplementing reading with active participation. \\n\\nAll the “rabbit holes” that I have entered over the years have had both unknown depth and importance. Take for example the very currency/commodity/fad debate around bitcoin, I can’t discern between wasted effort and true value of the countless hours I spent re-reading The Wealth of Nations, and multiple more spent reading works of Hayek and other neoliberals (though would suggest at least one reading of [The Denationalisation of Money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denationalization_of_Money) for any crypto enthusiast). \\n\\nHowever I truly believe that the time I spent exploring (solo and with others) the realm of crypto currency valuation models and participating in the markets, compounded my understanding far more than any reading did. \\n\\nSo, the only way IMO to get oriented is to keep your mental models (of all things business, culture and economic activity) flexible and ever evolving by actively participating. \\n\\nWant to go down the NFT rabbit hole? Time-box your question of which NFT to buy and then go buy it! Engage with the community on discord, experience how hodlers vs traders behave. Soak in the chaos a bit! \\n\\nI would have learnt more about NFTs and crystal gazed in to the future of gamefi by participating in [wolf game](https://wolf.game/) than I have via all reading, listening podcasts and other passive learning pursuits. I learnt about the fragility of these new projects, true nature of long term supporting communities, saw first hand the journey of developers truly building in public and seeking forgiveness instead of monolithic evolution of products that I was so accustomed to, and so much more. \\n\\n![Risk game in Wolf Game.  Their discord was lit up with folks creating and posting probabilistic models and predictions on community decision making! #FTW](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zan0NuJg4I2ZU_SGJDqzq.png?height=1628&width=2814)\\n\\nPS: Active participation is  a means to supplement and maximise ROI of efforts, reading is still table stakes! \\n\\nIf you a participant in the world of technology investing and/or venture building, and are excited about going deep anything crypto (web3/NFT/Defi/roll-ups/gamefi/..) feel free to ping me on twitter ([@RTinkslinger](https://twitter.com/RTinkslinger)) Happy to engage #wagmi \",\"timestamp\":1641206318,\"title\":\"Crypto Musings - How to get oriented in crypto ? \"},\"digest\":\"ATk49ecuxFr6_sUQQ0hMGvT2iFl7jmyiOgQ64cOY1ec\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x764178B7AD6e71767fad9Aa49C273E77faf31E22\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZKxNJ391yehO5uoZKkK8mFS1VqrE8jaZmUyDD7VjcG4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HCq8Q3Bd6qcVTXyBQNL8StcXICjaP2sTaYCJFs9IPsE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ipeLQhk1zjTY19BZlARp-2E6TH53tRwUcX0iMs4xiAbw5P5AAkDMvei03sNjQMow49SVP5iWyPezFpBj2hvz8w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd40ccc829cb36bddf986e8252095c2e8440365c187e2b06b0f51263606427f72732c9dd74cbddb771ff021dabd10dd65517d94d52d4561cff60442a29ff0e08c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZKxNJ391yehO5uoZKkK8mFS1VqrE8jaZmUyDD7VjcG4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"HCq8Q3Bd6qcVTXyBQNL8StcXICjaP2sTaYCJFs9IPsE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ATk49ecuxFr6_sUQQ0hMGvT2iFl7jmyiOgQ64cOY1ec\"}"
