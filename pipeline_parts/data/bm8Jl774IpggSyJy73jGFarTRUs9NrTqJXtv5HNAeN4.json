"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Born in 1968, Platon studied at Saint Martin’s School of Art and the Royal College of Art. He began working in London, earning his stripes as a photographer. Soon, he was accumulating portraits in his arresting style, which could be both authentic and dramatic, earning himself a name at British Vogue.\\n\\nHe did not realize it, but John F. Kennedy Jr. was scouting for a photographer to launch his new George magazine in New York. Kennedy picked out multiple of Platon’s portrait photographs in magazines and told his aides he wanted that photographer, without even knowing his name at that stage. Kennedy just knew he wanted a photographer to shoot people in a way that felt real. He had grown up inside the inner circle, but wanted to present people – politicians and celebrities – as real people. So, Platon was found and invited to New York based on his work.\\n\\nIt was 1995. The magazine’s tagline was “Not Just Politics As Usual” and neither were the images. Platon says:\\n\\n> *“John told me we were working on a secret new project. He wanted to humanize the world’s most powerful people. He gave me access, he said I must always be respectful but he wanted me to produce real photography.”*\\n\\nWhen Kennedy was tragically killed in 1999, Platon was doing a cover story for him the same day. Platon had just landed in Hollywood when the FBI met him at the airport to tell him the news.\\n\\n“I was by then rooted in the States but I had to continue without my mentor,” he says.\",\"timestamp\":1639040118,\"title\":\"Born in 1968, Platon studied at Saint Martin’s School\"},\"digest\":\"omldbI6T7gO2EEd7LKeU-iczDYdax5A8U9aNjjSN7sU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x68C9f981a2CEF37445719a678eb61b779EE4CDB1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IX-ogWFVgCdQUDnWewYdZegJviy80ZXFI9ai0vw_T7U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yuRTl6C1akFh8nXL8dFSTdkbtky2rahF1u9P8xYzJrY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KV4kBSeva1QKyS8ZFk7FkL-tQpPfPePy8weKkSaf-VX-URFxtWQYO_nAHxsibFFEOWUAPtWAkPims3V2Qfdabg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd69fe576cb2ef3f79d3ef36d069b6d2383b9f35129a68576e8e355814811cfee3a7933b940b16b164685653fcf62aa429f162c7674598a2d89a75ef6386fc3581b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IX-ogWFVgCdQUDnWewYdZegJviy80ZXFI9ai0vw_T7U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yuRTl6C1akFh8nXL8dFSTdkbtky2rahF1u9P8xYzJrY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"omldbI6T7gO2EEd7LKeU-iczDYdax5A8U9aNjjSN7sU\"}"
