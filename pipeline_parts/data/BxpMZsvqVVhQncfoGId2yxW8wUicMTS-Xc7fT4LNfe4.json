"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In October 2021, social media giant Facebook decided to ditch the \\\"face\\\" and renamed itself Meta to announce its entry into the metasverse. Meta is short for Metaverse. As a result, meta-universe stocks skyrocketed in two months, and even meta-universe virtual real estate transactions and meta-universe luxury goods appeared.\\n\\nHow big is the future market for the metasverse? The meta-universe is the next big investment theme, poised to become an $8 trillion supermarket, Morgan Stanley said in a note to investors. The Caribbean island nation of Barbados has even announced that it will officially launch a digital embassy representing sovereign states on January 1, 2022. All this information shows that the metasverse is not simple! Great for the future! So, what exactly is the metadverse? It even triggered the chase of Chinese and American capital markets? We're gonna have to take our time to figure this out. Our grandparents fell behind The Times after the reform and opening up, and they were significantly less adapted to the post-reform society than our parents. Our parents are behind The Times after entering the Internet society, they are obviously not as good as us to adapt to the social life of the Internet. So how will our generation be left behind? It may not have been clear in the past, but now it seems most likely that because of the metasomes, we will fall behind our children and become outcasts like our grandparents, parents and grandparents. So if we want to keep up with The Times, we need to understand not only what the meta-universe is, but how it relates to it, how it affects the future, and how we can keep up with it.\\n\\nThe term metaverse was coined in the 1992 science fiction novel Avalanche, which depicts a vast virtual reality world. Here, people use digital avatars to control and compete with each other to improve their status. Until now, it was a futuristic world. At present, the universal definition of the meta-universe is: a virtual world linked and created by means of science and technology, mapped and interactive with the real world, is a digital living space with a new social system. To take a simple example, it can make us enter the game with an immersive experience in reality, and have corresponding virtual assets and virtual social relations in the game, and even create a more real Internet application experience and social form that integrates the virtual and the real for us, which is the meta-universe.\\n\\nTo put it more generally, the meta-universe is to virtualize people's experience in the real world into the network digital society in a certain way, and create a society in the virtual digital world, which is now the universal concept of the meta-universe.\",\"timestamp\":1641290448,\"title\":\"Why care about the metasverse?
