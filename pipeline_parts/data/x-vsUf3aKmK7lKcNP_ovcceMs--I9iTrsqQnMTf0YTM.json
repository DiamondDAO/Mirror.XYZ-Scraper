This project is an ongoing experimentation to involve the community and create an interactive report. Be involved. Join the [#ff-canon](https://discord.gg/EeVW89eBxX) Discord channel and vote for your favorite resources!**\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nLast week, we released the first section of theÂ [Forefront Digital Economy highlighting the best podcasts](https://forefront.market/canon/podcasts)Â in the Web3 space, and we've been overwhelmed by the positive feedback we received! The 10 nominees of the first race accumulated a total of 100,654 votes, with the three winners each topped by more than 10,000 votes. We want to give a big thanks to all the $FF holders for being such an invaluable support in helping us pushing the Web3 and Social Tokens space forward.\\n\\nBecause this is an ever-evolving experimentation, we wanted to share with you the feedback we received during the first section, and take the time to reflect on the things we could improve moving forward.\\n\\n## First, The Winners! âœ¨\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/forefront__/status/1460464720830353416](https://twitter.com/forefront__/status/1460464720830353416)\\n\\nCongrats to our three winners. Each of these podcasts is helping push the space forward and making crypto more accessible to a broader audience. Again, congrats!\\n\\n## Second, Introducing the FF AWARDS! ðŸš€\\n\\n**Forefront is working to develop THE playbook for curation in web3. This experiment aims to revolutionize collective taste-making and involve more Forefront's community members in the process.**Â \\n\\nLike the Oscars for movies, the FF AWARDS rewards the top Web3 creators in different categories, letting Forefront community members vote for their favorite creators and resources. Last week, $FF holders voted for their favorite podcasts in the space.\\n\\nThe winners of this first category will receive a special NFT, the title of \\\"Best Creator\\\" in their category, and be highlighted in our Final Report.\\n\\nThe goal of the FF AWARDS is to be a 100% community-driven recognition and celebration of the high-quality work being done throughout the space. $FF holders have full control over the initial list, voting, etc.\\n\\n## Third, WAGMI!\\n\\n**At Forefront, we aim to create THE playbook for curation in web3 by leveraging Token permissioned Race similar to Mirror's Write Race mechanics**. This experiment aims to revolutionize Collective taste-making and involve more Forefront's community members in our projects. Our goal is to build the \\\"Port of Entry\\\" to Web3 Social Clubs & Digital Cities, and we need $FF holders to build it with us.\\n\\nThis is a collaborative project, and we need your help to increase the quality of the final report.
