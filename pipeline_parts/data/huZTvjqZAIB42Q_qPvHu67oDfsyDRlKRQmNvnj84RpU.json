"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Mrs. Phillips gave a little start at seeing her; but was glad that she had come.  Phillips had not been down for two days and she had been feeling lonesome.  She persisted in talking more than Joan felt was good for her.  She was feeling so much better, she explained.  Joan was relieved when the nurse came back from her walk and insisted on her lying down.  She dropped to sleep while Joan and the nurse were having their tea.\\n\\nJoan went back by the early train.  She met some people at the station that she knew and travelled up with them.  That picture of Mrs. Phillips's tongue just showing beyond the line of Mrs. Phillips's cheek remained at the back of her mind; but it was not until she was alone in her own rooms that she dared let her thoughts return to it.\\n\\nThe suggestion that was forcing itself into her brain was monstrous--unthinkable.  That, never possessed of any surplus vitality, and suffering from the added lassitude of illness, the woman should have become indifferent--willing to let a life that to her was full of fears and difficulties slip peacefully away from her, that was possible.  But that she should exercise thought and ingenuity--that she should have reasoned the thing out and deliberately laid her plans, calculating at every point on their success; it was inconceivable.\\n\\nBesides, what could have put the idea into her head?  It was laughable, the presumption that she was a finished actress, capable of deceiving everyone about her.  If she had had an inkling of the truth, Joan, with every nerve on the alert, almost hoping for it, would have detected it.  She had talked with her alone the day before she had left England, and the woman had been full of hopes and projects for the future.\\n\\nThat picture of Mrs. Phillips, propped up against the pillows, with her make-up box upon her knees was still before her when she went to bed.  All night long it haunted her:  whether thinking or dreaming of it, she could not tell.\\n\\nSuddenly, she sat up with a stifled cry.  It seemed as if a flash of light had been turned upon her, almost blinding her.\\n\\nHilda!  Why had she never thought of it?  The whole thing was so obvious.  \\\"You ought not to think about yourself.  You ought to think only of him and of his work.  Nothing else matters.\\\"  If she could say that to Joan, what might she not have said to her mother who, so clearly, she divined to be the incubus--the drag upon her father's career?  She could hear the child's dry, passionate tones- -could see Mrs. Phillips's flabby cheeks grow white--the frightened, staring eyes.  Where her father was concerned the child had neither conscience nor compassion.  She had waited her time. It was a few days after Hilda's return to school that Mrs. Phillips had been first taken ill.\\n\\nShe flung herself from the bed and drew the blind.  A chill, grey light penetrated the room.  It was a little before five.  She would go round to Phillips, wake him up.  He must be told.\\n\\nWith her hat in her hands, she paused.  No.  That would not do. Phillips must never know.  They must keep the secret to themselves. She would go down and see the woman; reason with her, insist.  She went into the other room.  It was lighter there.  The \\\"A.B.C.\\\" was standing in its usual place upon her desk.  There was a train to Folkestone at six-fifteen.  She had plenty of time.  It would be wise to have a cup of tea and something to eat.  There would be no sense in arriving there with a headache.  She would want her brain clear.\\n\\nIt was half-past five when she sat down with her tea in front of her.  It was only ten minutes' walk to Charing Cross--say a quarter of an hour.  She might pick up a cab.  She grew calmer as she ate and drank.  Her reason seemed to be returning to her.  There was no such violent hurry.  Hadn't she better think things over, in the clear daylight?  The woman had been ill now for nearly six weeks: a few hours--a day or two--could make no difference.  It might alarm the poor creature, her unexpected appearance at such an unusual hour--cause a relapse.  Suppose she had been mistaken? Hadn't she better make a few inquiries first--feel her way?  One did harm more often than good, acting on impulse.  After all, had she the right to interfere?  Oughtn't the thing to be thought over as a whole?  Mightn't there be arguments, worth considering, against her interference?  Her brain was too much in a whirl. Hadn't she better wait till she could collect and arrange her thoughts?\\n\\nThe silver clock upon her desk struck six.  It had been a gift from her father when she was at Girton.  It never obtruded.  Its voice was a faint musical chime that she need not hear unless she cared to listen.  She turned and looked at it.  It seemed to be a little face looking back at her out of its two round, blinkless eyes.  For the first time during all the years that it had watched beside her, she heard its quick, impatient tick.\\n\\nShe sat motionless, staring at it.  The problem, in some way, had simplified itself into a contest between herself, demanding time to think, and the little insistent clock, shouting to her to act upon blind impulse.  If she could remain motionless for another five minutes, she would have won.\\n\\nThe ticking of the little clock was filling the room.  The thing seemed to have become alive--to be threatening to burst its heart. But the thin, delicate indicator moved on.\\n\\nSuddenly its ticking ceased.  It had become again a piece of lifeless mechanism.  The hands pointed to six minutes past.  Joan took off her hat and laid it aside.\\n\\nShe must think the whole thing over quietly.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIV\\n\\nShe could help him.  Without her, he would fail.  The woman herself saw that, and wished it.  Why should she hesitate?  It was not as if she had only herself to consider.  The fate--the happiness of millions was at stake.  He looked to her for aid--for guidance.  It must have been intended.  All roads had led to it.  Her going to the house.  She remembered now, it was the first door at which she had knocked.  Her footsteps had surely been directed.  Her meeting with Mrs. Phillips in Madge's rooms; and that invitation to dinner, coinciding with that crisis in his life.  It was she who had persuaded him to accept.  But for her he would have doubted, wavered, let his opportunities slip by.  He had confessed it to her.\\n\\nAnd she had promised him.  He needed her.  The words she had spoken to Madge, not dreaming then of their swift application.  They came back to her.  \\\"God has called me.  He girded His sword upon me.\\\" What right had she to leave it rusting in its scabbard, turning aside from the pathway pointed out to her because of one weak, useless life, crouching in her way.  It was not as if she were being asked to do evil herself that good might come.  The decision had been taken out of her hands.  All she had to do was to remain quiescent, not interfering, awaiting her orders.  Her business was with her own part, not with another's.  To be willing to sacrifice oneself:  that was at the root of all service.  Sometimes it was one's own duty, sometimes that of another.  Must one never go forward because another steps out of one's way, voluntarily? Besides, she might have been mistaken.  That picture, ever before her, of the woman pausing with the brush above her tongue--that little stilled gasp!  It may have been but a phantasm, born of her own fevered imagination.  She clung to that, desperately.\\n\\nIt was the task that had been entrusted to her.  How could he hope to succeed without her.  With her, he would be all powerful-- accomplish the end for which he had been sent into the world. Society counts for so much in England.  What public man had ever won through without its assistance.  As Greyson had said:  it is the dinner-table that rules.  She could win it over to his side. That mission to Paris that she had undertaken for Mrs. Denton, that had brought her into contact with diplomatists, politicians, the leaders and the rulers, the bearers of names known and honoured in history.  They had accepted her as one of themselves.  She had influenced them, swayed them.  That afternoon at Folk's studio, where all eyes had followed her, where famous men and women had waited to attract her notice, had hung upon her words.  Even at school, at college, she had always commanded willing homage.  As Greyson had once told her, it was herself--her personality that was her greatest asset.  Was it to be utterly wasted?  There were hundreds of impersonal, sexless women, equipped for nothing else, with pens as keen if not keener than hers.  That was not the talent with which she had been entrusted--for which she would have to account.  It was her beauty, her power to charm, to draw after her- -to compel by the mere exercise of her will.  Hitherto Beauty had been content to barter itself for mere coin of the realm--for ease and luxury and pleasure.  She only asked to be allowed to spend it in service.  As his wife, she could use it to fine ends.  By herself she was helpless.  One must take the world as one finds it. It gives the unmated woman no opportunity to employ the special gifts with which God has endowed her--except for evil.  As the wife of a rising statesman, she could be a force for progress.  She could become another Madame Roland; gather round her all that was best of English social life; give back to it its lost position in the vanguard of thought.\\n\\nShe could strengthen him, give him courage.  Without her, he would always remain the mere fighter, doubtful of himself.  The confidence, the inspiration, necessary for leadership, she alone could bring to him.  Each by themselves was incomplete.  Together, they would be the whole.  They would build the city of their dreams.\\n\\nShe seemed to have become a wandering spirit rather than a living being.  She had no sense of time or place.  Once she had started, hearing herself laugh.  She was seated at a table, and was talking. And then she had passed back into forgetfulness.  Now, from somewhere, she was gazing downward.  Roofs, domes and towers lay stretched before her, emerging from a sea of shadows.  She held out her arms towards them and the tears came to her eyes.  The poor tired people were calling to her to join with him to help them. Should she fail them--turn deaf ears to the myriad because of pity for one useless, feeble life?\\n\\nShe had been fashioned to be his helpmate, as surely as if she had been made of the same bone.  Nature was at one with God.  Spirit and body both yearned for him.  It was not position--power for herself that she craved.  The marriage market--if that had been her desire:  it had always been open to her.  She had the gold that buys these things.  Wealth, ambition:  they had been offered to her--spread out temptingly before her eyes.  They were always within her means, if ever she chose to purchase them.  It was this man alone to whom she had ever felt drawn--this man of the people, with that suggestion about him of something primitive, untamed, causing her always in his presence that faint, compelling thrill of fear, who stirred her blood as none of the polished men of her own class had ever done.  His kind, strong, ugly face:  it moved beside her:  its fearless, tender eyes now pleading, now commanding.\\n\\nHe needed her.  She heard his passionate, low voice, as she had heard it in the little garden above Meudon:  \\\"Because you won't be there; and without you I can do nothing.\\\"  What right had this poor, worn-out shadow to stand between them, to the end?  Had love and life no claims, but only weakness?  She had taken all, had given nothing.  It was but reparation she was making.  Why stop her?\\n\\nShe was alone in a maze of narrow, silent streets that ended always in a high blank wall.  It seemed impossible to get away from this blank wall.  Whatever way she turned she was always coming back to it.\\n\\nWhat was she to do?  Drag the woman back to life against her will-- lead her back to him to be a chain about his feet until the end? Then leave him to fight the battle alone?\\n\\nAnd herself?  All her world had been watching and would know.  She had counted her chickens before they were dead.  She had set her cap at the man, reckoning him already widowed; and his wife had come to life and snatched it from her head.  She could hear the laughter--the half amused, half contemptuous pity for her \\\"rotten bad luck.\\\"  She would be their standing jest, till she was forgotten.\\n\\nWhat would life leave to her?  A lonely lodging and a pot of ink that she would come to hate the smell of.  She could never marry. It would be but her body that she could give to any other man.  Not even for the sake of her dreams could she bring herself to that. It might have been possible before, but not now.  She could have won the victory over herself, but for hope, that had kindled the smouldering embers of her passion into flame.  What cunning devil had flung open this door, showing her all her heart's desire, merely that she should be called upon to slam it to in her own face?\\n\\nA fierce anger blazed up in her brain.  Why should she listen?  Why had reason been given to us if we were not to use it--weigh good and evil in the balance and decide for ourselves where lay the nobler gain?  Were we to be led hither and thither like blind children?  What was right--what wrong, but what our own God-given judgment told us?  Was it wrong of the woman to perform this act of self-renunciation, yielding up all things to love?  No, it was great--heroic of her.  It would be her cross of victory, her crown.\\n\\nIf the gift were noble, so also it could not be ignoble to accept it.\\n\\nTo reject it would be to dishonour it.\\n\\nShe would accept it.  The wonder of it should cast out her doubts and fears.  She would seek to make herself worthy of it. Consecrate it with her steadfastness, her devotion.\\n\\nShe thought it ended.  But yet she sat there motionless.\\n\\nWhat was plucking at her sleeve--still holding her?\\n\\nUnknowing, she had entered a small garden.  It formed a passage between two streets, and was left open day and night.  It was but a narrow strip of rank grass and withered shrubs with an asphalte pathway widening to a circle in the centre, where stood a gas lamp and two seats, facing one another.\\n\\nAnd suddenly it came to her that this was her Garden of Gethsemane; and a dull laugh broke from her that she could not help.  It was such a ridiculous apology for Gethsemane.  There was not a corner in which one could possibly pray.  Only these two iron seats, one each side of the gaunt gas lamp that glared down upon them.  Even the withered shrubs were fenced off behind a railing.  A ragged figure sprawled upon the bench opposite to her.  It snored gently, and its breath came laden with the odour of cheap whisky.\\n\\nBut it was her Gethsemane:  the best that Fate had been able to do for her.  It was here that her choice would be made.  She felt that.\\n\\nAnd there rose before her the vision of that other Garden of Gethsemane with, below it, the soft lights of the city shining through the trees; and above, clear against the star-lit sky, the cold, dark cross.\\n\\nIt was only a little cross, hers, by comparison.  She could see that.  They seemed to be standing side by side.  But then she was only a woman--little more than a girl.  And her courage was so small.  She thought He ought to know that.  For her, it was quite a big cross.  She wondered if He had been listening to all her arguments.  There was really a good deal of sense in some of them. Perhaps He would understand.  Not all His prayer had come down to us.  He, too, had put up a fight for life.  He, too, was young. For Him, also, life must have seemed but just beginning.  Perhaps He, too, had felt that His duty still lay among the people-- teaching, guiding, healing them.  To Him, too, life must have been sweet with its noble work, its loving comradeship.  Even from Him the words had to be wrung:  \\\"Thy will, not Mine, be done.\\\"\\n\\nShe whispered them at last.  Not bravely, at all.  Feebly, haltingly, with a little sob:  her forehead pressed against the cold iron seat, as if that could help her.\\n\\nShe thought that even then God might reconsider it--see her point of view.  Perhaps He would send her a sign.\\n\\nThe ragged figure on the bench opposite opened its eyes, stared at her; then went to sleep again.  A prowling cat paused to rub itself against her foot, but meeting no response, passed on.  Through an open window, somewhere near, filtered the sound of a child's low whimpering.\\n\\nIt was daylight when she awoke.  She was cold and her limbs ached. Slowly her senses came back to her.  The seat opposite was vacant. The gas lamp showed but a faint blue point of flame.  Her dress was torn, her boots soiled and muddy.  Strands of her hair had escaped from underneath her hat.\\n\\nShe looked at her watch.  Fortunately it was still early.  She would be able to let herself in before anyone was up.  It was but a little way.  She wondered, while rearranging her hair, what day it was.  She would find out, when she got home, from the newspaper.\\n\\nIn the street she paused a moment and looked back through the railings.  It seemed even still more sordid in the daylight:  the sooty grass and the withered shrubs and the asphalte pathway strewn with dirty paper.  And again a laugh she could not help broke from her.  Her Garden of Gethsemane!\\n\\nShe sent a brief letter round to Phillips, and a telegram to the nurse, preparing them for what she meant to do.  She had just time to pack a small trunk and catch the morning train.  At Folkestone, she drove first to a house where she herself had once lodged and fixed things to her satisfaction.  The nurse was waiting for her in the downstairs room, and opened the door to her.  She was opposed to Joan's interference.  But Joan had come prepared for that.  \\\"Let me have a talk with her,\\\" she said.  \\\"I think I've found out what it is that is causing all the trouble.\\\"\\n\\nThe nurse shot her a swift glance.  \\\"I'm glad of that,\\\" she said dryly.  She let Joan go upstairs.\\n\\nMrs. Phillips was asleep.  Joan seated herself beside the bed and waited.  She had not yet made herself up for the day and the dyed hair was hidden beneath a white, close-fitting cap.  The pale, thin face with its closed eyes looked strangely young.  Suddenly the thin hands clasped, and her lips moved, as if she were praying in her sleep.  Perhaps she also was dreaming of Gethsemane.  It must be quite a crowded garden, if only we could see it.\\n\\nAfter a while, her eyes opened.  Joan drew her chair nearer and slipped her arm in under her, and their eyes met.\\n\\n\\\"You're not playing the game,\\\" whispered Joan, shaking her head. \\\"I only promised on condition that you would try to get well.\\\"\\n\\nThe woman made no attempt to deny.  Something told her that Joan had learned her secret.  She glanced towards the door.  Joan had closed it.\\n\\n\\\"Don't drag me back,\\\" she whispered.  \\\"It's all finished.\\\"  She raised herself up and put her arms about Joan's neck.  \\\"It was hard at first, and I hated you.  And then it came to me that this was what I had been wanting to do, all my life--something to help him, that nobody else could do.  Don't take it from me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know,\\\" whispered Joan.  \\\"I've been there, too.  I knew you were doing it, though I didn't quite know how--till the other day.  I wouldn't think.  I wanted to pretend that I didn't.  I know all you can say.  I've been listening to it.  It was right of you to want to give it all up to me for his sake.  But it would be wrong of me to take it.  I don't quite see why.  I can't explain it.  But I mustn't.  So you see it would be no good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But I'm so useless,\\\" pleaded the woman.\\n\\n\\\"I said that,\\\" answered Joan.  \\\"I wanted to do it and I talked and talked, so hard.  I said everything I could think of.  But that was the only answer:  I mustn't do it.\\\"\\n\\nThey remained for a while with their arms round one another.  It struck Joan as curious, even at the time, that all feeling of superiority had gone out of her.  They might have been two puzzled children that had met one another on a path that neither knew.  But Joan was the stronger character.\\n\\n\\\"I want you to give me up that box,\\\" she said, \\\"and to come away with me where I can be with you and take care of you until you are well.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Phillips made yet another effort.  \\\"Have you thought about him?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nJoan answered with a faint smile.  \\\"Oh, yes,\\\" she said.  \\\"I didn't forget that argument in case it hadn't occurred to the Lord.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps,\\\" she added, \\\"the helpmate theory was intended to apply only to our bodies.  There was nothing said about our souls. Perhaps God doesn't have to work in pairs.  Perhaps we were meant to stand alone.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Phillips's thin hands were playing nervously with the bed clothes.  There still seemed something that she had to say.  As if Joan hadn't thought of everything.  Her eyes were fixed upon the narrow strip of light between the window curtains.\\n\\n\\\"You don't think you could, dear,\\\" she whispered, \\\"if I didn't do anything wicked any more.  But just let things take their course.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You see, dear,\\\" she went on, her face still turned away, \\\"I thought it all finished.  It will be hard for me to go back to him, knowing as I do now that he doesn't want me.  I shall always feel that I am in his way.  And Hilda,\\\" she added after a pause, \\\"she will hate me.\\\"\\n\\nJoan looked at the white patient face and was silent.  What would be the use of senseless contradiction.  The woman knew.  It would only seem an added stab of mockery.  She knelt beside the bed, and took the thin hands in hers.\\n\\n\\\"I think God must want you very badly,\\\" she said, \\\"or He wouldn't have laid so heavy a cross upon you.  You will come?\\\"\\n\\nThe woman did not answer in words.  The big tears were rolling down her cheeks.  There was no paint to mingle with and mar them.  She drew the little metal box from under the pillow and gave it into Joan's hands.\\n\\nJoan crept out softly from the room.\\n\\nThe nurse was standing by the window.  She turned sharply on Joan's entrance.  Joan slipped the box into her hands.\\n\\nThe nurse raised the lid.  \\\"What a fool I've been,\\\" she said.  \\\"I never thought of that.\\\"\\n\\nShe held out a large strong hand and gave Joan a longish grip. \\\"You're right,\\\" she said, \\\"we must get her out of this house at once.  Forgive me.\\\"\\n\\nPhillips had been called up north and wired that he would not be able to get down till the Wednesday evening.  Joan met him at the station.\\n\\n\\\"She won't be expecting you, just yet,\\\" she explained.  \\\"We might have a little walk.\\\"\\n\\nShe waited till they had reached a quiet road leading to the hills.\\n\\n\\\"You will find her changed,\\\" she said.  \\\"Mentally, I mean.  Though she will try not to show it.  She was dying for your sake--to set you free.  Hilda seems to have had a talk with her and to have spared her no part of the truth.  Her great love for you made the sacrifice possible and even welcome.  It was the one gift she had in her hands.  She was giving it gladly, proudly.  So far as she was concerned, it would have been kinder to let her make an end of it.  But during the last few days I have come to the conclusion there is a law within us that we may not argue with.  She is coming back to life, knowing you no longer want her, that she is only in the way.  Perhaps you may be able to think of something to say or do that will lessen her martyrdom.  I can't.\\\"\\n\\nThey had paused where a group of trees threw a blot of shadow across the moonlit road.\\n\\n\\\"You mean she was killing herself?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Quite cleverly.  So as to avoid all danger of after discovery: that might have hurt us,\\\" she answered.\",\"timestamp\":1639211196,\"title\":\"\\nJoan felt her knees trembling.
