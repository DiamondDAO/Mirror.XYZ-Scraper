"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Kleros](https://kleros.io/) protocol deserves a mini-series of explanation as it's one of the most unique Ethereum projects out there. Community members crucially play its role in keeping its dapps achieve the protocol‚Äôs proposition of decentralization.\\n\\nLet‚Äôs start with [Kleros Tokens](https://tokens.kleros.io/).\\n\\nThe decentralized app quite nails its purpose of a vetted token list not by the exchange team themselves but by a whole community that results in safer token swaps. You can see Kleros Tokens integrated in [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/), [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/en/swap), [Paraswap](https://paraswap.io/) and [CowSwap](https://cowswap.exchange/).\\n\\nAt the moment, only Ethereum-based tokens are accepted in the list. But it‚Äôs a shame ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è really as there‚Äôs already a handful of chains and reputable decentralized exchanges that Kleros Tokens can be integrated into and expand its purpose of high quality token curation.\\n\\n### How does the vetting work?\\n\\nFirst off, none is excluded from adding a token from the list. Whether you are a founder or developer or just a strong supporter of a project, you can submit a request to add the token to Kleros Tokens unlike centralized exchanges listings where a form has to be filled out only by a project‚Äôs key team members.\\n\\n> `However, it must go through a period of checks by community members before a token gets listed or registered.`\\n\\n![card view of a registration request](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/G_A6jWNluHota0dzo2g-5.png?height=419&width=464)\\n\\n**The period of checks is where the app gets more interesting**¬†üëÄ\\n\\nAlthough it doesn‚Äôt require a listing fee, the ***submitter*** has to put in an ETH deposit which serves as a possible reward to someone who finds the submission not in accordance with the [listing criteria](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmTL1SCKpRcr7NRbVpXW6z9QoQXRHJT5cQr6PEge5qoLwU/t2cr-primary-document.pdf). The person who finds fault called ***challenger*** also puts in an ETH deposit. Whenever this instance happens - a submission is opposed by someone - a dispute is created and 3 jurors will arbitrate the case. The jurors get some juicy fee in ETH for their work. üí∞\\n\\n> ### A curation battleground!¬†‚öî\\n>\\n> *Submitter vs Challenger . Jurors vs Jurors*\\n\\n![card view of a challenged submission](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z3zy-N54OZGvKiPaFrORG.png?height=444&width=456)\\n\\nThe image above if expanded on will show the dispute number (998) and the current dispute period. That‚Äôs 1 day for *evidence*, 3 days for *voting* and 3 days for *appeal* as standard. Or you can use [Dispute Resolver](https://resolve.kleros.io/) to check time remaining for each period along with other ongoing cases.\\n\\n![evidence period](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mvut9v1jk_UM63zVzEBnR.png?height=314&width=1305)\\n\\nEvidence period, as the name implies, is when the submitter and challenger provide evidence supporting their claim and refute each other. Jurors can join in the discourse too once the voting period starts.\\n\\n![voting period](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-uq3T7d6WDjZK056LiMrf.png?height=317&width=1312)\\n\\nA selected juror only has to choose from two options ***Yes or No*** on disputes created on this particular app. An appeal can be made if the losing side thinks the ruling was incorrect and so wants to have another set of jurors arbitrate the case.\\n\\n![https://resolve.kleros.io/cases/998](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/NJt2zqORxv0GxTvkzm0kX.png?height=403&width=1085)\\n\\n> `However, both sides need to be fully funded for the appeal round to push through.`\\n\\nInterestingly, anyone in the community üë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüëßcan fund the appeal, not just the two parties involved. What‚Äôs even more fun is funding a winning side equates to some ETH rewards so it's a cleverly-devised incentive opportunity for everyone! üé≤\\n\\n**One downside of the appeal process is that a win by technicality can happen.** That is if only one side managed to fully fund the next round of arbitration, the side with 100% funding becomes the winner. So you see, a losing party can win if the winning side did not get his funding for the next round. **But to be fair, *at least as I see it*, the losing party has a shorter period to appeal than that of the winning side.**¬†‚è≥\\n\\n> Thus if you are involved in a dispute it‚Äôs imperative to monitor the progress until it‚Äôs closed.\\n\\n### How can I submit a request without getting into a dispute?\\n\\nBelow are the main things to be mindful of when submitting a request to register:\\n\\n* Most common name\\n* Unique and correct token address\\n* Token logo with all the image guidelines met\\n\\n![https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0x33829730f348030e26e6ab2980833eb58388387e4afade6cf08a6f5e9b6de598](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/X5MgYhp7w-vmJWZVPPvqJ.png?height=296&width=1518&&size=medium)\\n\\nSubmission requests will take üóì 5 days and 6 hours to get registered if no one challenges it.\\n\\n> Moreover, not only the request to list is subjected to the vetting process but also a **request to remove**. An ETH deposit ( which varies depends on parameters proposed and voted on at Kleros governance ) is also required and **follows the same challenge process and period.**\\n\\nYou might ask why would someone request to remove a token? ü§î\\n\\nWell once at least one of the three fields need updating, removal requests can and have to be made. Found a recently removed token as an example:\\n\\n![https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0xa50ec2f57eb5ac444b0346ddcd37d89ccb5cc7e5d09f5843815f174143f9ef63](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/UC3HEYWegh3vFs6YfHHh0.png?height=732&width=891)\\n\\n> ### Note that ETH deposits will be returned when a token is successfully registered and/or removed.¬†ü§≤\\n\\n### What else can be vetted on?\\n\\nAside from requesting to list and remove tokens in the registry, anyone can add badges on registered tokens **with quite high-stakes.**\\n\\n![option located at the bottom of a registered token](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DA44JgINisUDRuZutsxWK.png?height=787&width=715)\\n\\n* Compliant with [ERC20 Standard Token](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmTgWyAp642wEkCMFj3XyoJTMrTFBtW82c3f3ZsVqRRERa/erc20-standard-token-badge-primary-document.pdf)\\n* Compliant with [True Cryptosystem Listing](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmVEbT5LktUzdfmqqpgTdZx88oNuij8JC128oXkQpSocqb/true-cryptosystem-badge.pdf)\\n* Compliant with [Stablecoin Listing](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmazSC1jtkTyK1WJMG92SSz3aHUjBcYTMDxo3oFinH9QhL/stablecoin-badge.pdf)\\n* Compliant with [DutcX Badge](https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmRNK2cpW2i4Q9BBp58ALuhHnXuKEPkSBLU5q4mdtBG9i4/dutchx-badge.pdf)\\n\\n![https://tokens.kleros.io/badges](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/z1aTBNzBvt68PD-2_cABD.png?height=628&width=1493)\\n\\nKleros also launched a [reward program](https://blog.kleros.io/tokens-by-kleros-securing-uniswap-with-decentralized-lists/) for adding and updating tokens in the list as well as adding badges!
