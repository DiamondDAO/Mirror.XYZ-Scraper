Ethereum has a title of \\\"expensive chain\\\", haha, which means that the cost of Ethereum gas is too expensive. Before we start this article, I would like to ask you a question: \\\"How to reduce the cost of ETH's gas?\\\"\\n\\nFor the project side, can be:\\n\\n> Optimize the contract code and reduce the use of gas, which is a meticulous work that requires high quality and a lot of effort for developers.\\n\\nFor individual users, it is possible to:\\n\\n> Set a more accurate gas cost for each transaction based on the current gas cost, which is technically demanding for the user.\\n\\nRegardless of the optimization, the fact remains that ETH network fees are getting really expensive as the ETH price grows, and a normal transfer costs tens of dollars in fees, not to mention contract interactions, which is beyond the reach of millions of ordinary users.\\n\\n## Approach 1: Fund the open source contract base library\\n\\nGasDAO decided to use the DAO treasury to fund the base library of Solidity contracts like OpenZeppelin to fund related developers to optimize the contract code and reduce the gas cost. This measure is very important, even if the optimization of 10gwei, in the face of the huge number of contract calls, the optimization of the cost savings is immeasurable.\\n\\n## Approach 2: ETH value capture and payback\\n\\nThis method is an adopted community proposal from GasDAO at:\\n\\n[snapshot.org/#/gasdao.eth/proposal/0x277d50e163ba3152692f4f242b38e1d65ee684e10c701aa354aac01aacd3af28](http://snapshot.org/#/gasdao.eth/proposal/0x277d50e163ba3152692f4f242b38e1d65ee684e10c701aa354aac01aacd3af28)\\n\\nI'll briefly outline that during the time you hold $gas (the proposal is for a 2 week cycle), the gas fees you pay in the ETH network will be airdropped to your address according to a reward formula (not yet announced).\\n\\nLet me break down my opinion on why this will reduce the network cost of the ETH network. \\n\\nFirst, I need to introduce the EIP1559 proposal. As of January 3, 2022, the EIP1559 proposal has destroyed over 1,300,000 ETH.\\n\\nThe EIP1559 proposal is to split the gas cost of each ETH transaction into two parts: base cost (burn) + absenteeism cost (reward), and the proposal aims to solve the network congestion problem in Ether.\\n\\nThe proposal has been online for several months, whether the congestion problem is solved or not I don't know (because it is too expensive, I can't afford to use it), but the price of ETH is visible to the naked eye.\\n\\nIn fact, this raises the question that the burnt of ETH has caused a serious waste of resources, and these burned ETH are also hard-earned by miners. As ETH enters the mainstream, the practice of burning ETH to raise the price will come under more criticism as an explicit waste of resources.\\n\\nSo we need a way to capture the value of burned ETH back. This is what GasDAO is doing, and by returning $gas tokens to holders in a cycle based on the ETH gas fees they paid, GasDAO is capturing the value of the ETH burned in that cycle and returning it to the user. This method not only solves the problem of wasted ETH resources, but also compensates ETH users and reduces ETH network transaction fees!\\n\\nAt this point, some of you may understand that what GasDAO is trying to do is to take the burned ETH tokens and give them back to the active users of the ETH network.\",\"timestamp\":1641198436,\"title\":\"How does GasDao reduce transaction fees in the Ethernet network?\"},\"digest\":\"C77n2Sdm6n2leUIIE6T1yYDX7r-oTXyYwXoCSTJsOsU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x10Dbfcfd43B1C9bCcA0b5D0D895E528965f1A09b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Y5vZD56hNkcaF5j7pixpS3zXmq-bC2b8mnMCvwzciGk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OEEtMxc9s-zZ73OOAi1nAbFAz4I_IXObpWM-dI1FP88\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"NdfZ0oa9u4ENkcAfLxCZJSUiqvnSdlcyRftmPLuOl5DEZXUP07D83P4mK4b68zuQ-AwI_3AH2mwI72GijRqETQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0354cddc0c40866de1ba75c5c6202c296816767e0f2d7654d500950e2fa9ab853eb2fce327964c2177258718991dfd33273ca5af479eefb6ad8806e86d8aed9e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Y5vZD56hNkcaF5j7pixpS3zXmq-bC2b8mnMCvwzciGk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OEEtMxc9s-zZ73OOAi1nAbFAz4I_IXObpWM-dI1FP88\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"C77n2Sdm6n2leUIIE6T1yYDX7r-oTXyYwXoCSTJsOsU\"}"
