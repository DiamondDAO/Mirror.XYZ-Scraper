"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## OlympusDao:\\n\\nOlympus is a decentralized reserve currency protocol based on the OHM token. It was introduced  on February 2nd , 2021 by  pseudonymous founder/s. Since then it has gained immense attention and gained attention when investor such as mark cuban started buying its native token OHM and even more during the Defi 2.0 narrative \\n\\n![It's marketcap has gone parabolic](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zR6IWeasLrUaRf4CysOBU.png?height=566&width=940)\\n\\nwe currently don’t have a digital assets which can retain its stable purchasing power far into the future . Bitcoin, ethereum are digital assets not stable currencies but  in that case we have stable coins right? (usdt , usdc , dai ) etc . These are extremely good pegged  currencies and that is where the problem is , these stable coins will be affected by the monetary policies of the federal reserve such as inflation , excessive money printing etc .\\n\\n## OHM\\n\\nHow can we solve the problem , how can develop a true independent digital reserve currency?. That is where OHM comes in , it is a “backed” currency instead of being a pegged one. This enables ohm to be a free floating currency with no uperbound . The protocol guarantees that each ohm that is being issued will be backed  by atleast 1$ worth of dai (but not limited to) each ohm is currently backed by 152.86$ worth of assets in its treasury (source:- OlympusDao Dashboard)\\n\\nThe protocol will buy back ohm from the market using the treasury  if in case ohm price falls below 1 Dai thus 1 Dai being the absolute floor price in worse case scenario.(more about this in following section keep reading ;)\\n\\nThis mechanism has gained immense popularity and is clearly evident in the price of $OHM and its overall token hodlers.\\n\\n![source : Dune Dashboard](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Jduc8JV_6MT9xa7XrumUV.png?height=553&width=934)\\n\\n Use case:\\n\\nThere are primarily two use cases for ohm token apart from its status as being a potential reserve currency and those are: \\n                    1: Staking: You can stake your ohm and receive insane apy and as of writing this article the apy is 7197.5% apy , yes that’s not a typo \\n\\n                   2: Governance : If you stake your ohm you can receive sOHM which represents 1:1 of your staked ohm and you can vote on proposals with your tokens  \\n\\nHow can I ape into this token?\\n\\nYou can buy the token through one of the dex’s or a cex and also you can get the token from the protocol at a discounted rate than the market  rate , keep reading to learn how ;)\\n\\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus#markets](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/olympus#markets)\\n\\n## How does all of this work?\\n\\nWhen I was first heard olympus dao and its treasury I wondered how the protocol can afford to back each OHM by at-least 1 DAI worth of assets , it turns out they have a interesting trick up their sleeve \\n\\n### 1: Bonding \\n\\nThis is best explained using an example \\n\\nImagine the current price of OHM is 1000 dai and one day you wake up feeling degen and want to ape into OHM, usually you go to a dex like uniswap and swap your 1000 DAI and get 1 OHM in return.(since we assumed 1ohm = 1000 dai) \\n\\nIn the case of OlympusDao you can take this 1000 dai and bond in the OlympusDao website and in return get a discounted OHM token \",\"timestamp\":1638113285,\"title\":\"A new token aims to be the reserve currency of crypto?
