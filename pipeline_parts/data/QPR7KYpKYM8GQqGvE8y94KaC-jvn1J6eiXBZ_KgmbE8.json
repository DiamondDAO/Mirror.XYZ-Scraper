We are keen to explore the underlying logic and cutting-edge tracks in the field of digital encryption. Welcome to our Twitter: sparkdao_io\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OOfIoXkGm1-2-7Q05KkQR.jpg?height=388&width=900)\\n\\n### 01 A vulnerability in 2010 once created 184 million Bitcoins\\n\\nStart with an event that a novice in the encryption field might not know.On August 15,2010, a vulnerability in the Bitcoin blockchain once created over 184 million Bitcoins.The vulnerability is known as a \\\"value overflow event\\\" and involves block 74,638.There is a transaction in the block that created a 184,467,440,737.09551616BTC for 3 different addresses.Two of the addresses each received 92.2 million bitcoins, while miners solving the problems associated with the block were awarded 0.01BTC, which did not exist until the transaction.The vulnerability was that the code used to verify transactions did not consider the excessive amount that it exceeded the bitcoin limit before it was packaged in one block.\\n\\nNakamoto and another developer released a revised version of the bitcoin blockchain within just five hours of the discovery, and then rejected problematic blocks by splitting the blockchain.While several unpatched nodes continue to add blocks to the wrong version of the blockchain, the modified version of the Bitcoin blockchain completed the take-over from block 74691.From that block on, all nodes accepted a patch version of the Bitcoin blockchain as an authoritative version of the transaction history.\\n\\n### 02 The maximum circulation of Bitcoin is not 21 million\\n\\nUsually, most people think that the maximum circulation of Bitcoin is 21 million coins.But, in fact, the maximum circulation is slightly lower than 21 million, 2099999874769 B T C, due to the mining block reward mechanism developed by Nakamoto and sometimes eliminating mining errors created by new bitcoin units.\\n\\n### 03 Satoshi is not the smallest unit in the Bitcoin system\\n\\nMany people regard Satoshi (Cong) as the smallest unit of measurement in the Bitcoin system (1Satoshi is equal to 0.00000001BTC).However, there is a smaller unit in the already used Bitcoin Lightning Network system, named Millisatoshi (MSAT), representing one in a thousand Satoshi.\\n\\napproach:\\n\\n• 1 SAT =1000 MSAT\\n\\n• 1 SAT =0.00000001 BTC\\n\\n• 1 MSAT= 0.00000000001 BTC\\n\\n### 04 Nakamoto was missing or related to the CIA\\n\\nSources say that Nakamoto was taken away by the CIA for questioning in 2010.Shortly after this incident, Nakamoto disappeared without a trace and never heard from him again.Fortunately, before Nakamoto disappeared, he designated GavinAndresen (one of the first developers of the Bitcoin blockchain) as his successor, and gave him access to the Bitcoin blockchain project on the SourceForge, where the source was located.\\n\\n### 05 The earliest Bitcoin taps distributed the 5BTC to each visitor\\n\\nThe BitcoinFaucet (Bitcoin Faucet) is a Web site that distributes small amounts of Bitcoins for free to visitors.When users log in to such sites, they are already making money for website creators, because almost all websites are full of advertising, and they come from selling advertising, and distributing a small amount of bitcoin is giving back to users to get what they need.Today, the number of Bitcoins distributed by such sites is about 5-20Satoshi.\\n\\nIn June 2010, the first Bitcoin faucet site created by GavinAndersen distributed the 5BTC to each visitor, with the aim to encourage the adoption and use of Bitcoin.If early users benefited from such a plan at the time, these five bitcoins will give you more than $200,000 to today.\\n\\n### 06 More than 430 copycat coins are derived from Bitcoin\\n\\nAs the first cryptocurrency to successfully practice the concept of blockchain, Bitcoin has sparked a wave of new cryptographic projects.As of January 2022, over 15,000 cryptocurrencies are listed on CoinMarketCap.Of these, at least 436 cryptocurrencies are derived directly or indirectly from the bitcoin blockchain.Of course, these fork coins have not weakened bitcoin, which is still the king of cryptocurrencies so far.\\n\\n### 07 Nakamoto was nominated for a Nobel Prize in Economics\\n\\nBecause Bitcoin brings infinite possibilities to the world, all of these possibilities are closely related to the concept of blockchain.A mysterious and talented computer scientist, Nakamoto can be said to be the origin of the change.From the perspective of the world today, Bitcoin and blockchain technology will play an important role in the economy for years to come.As a founder, Nakamoto is arguably recognized because he was nominated for the 2016 Nobel Prize in economics.\\n\\n### 08 The 91.7%. bitcoin address balance is less than 0.1BTC\\n\\nCurrently, it has a global population of about 7.9 billion and less than 21 million bitcoin, so the number of people owning bitcoin itself is small.But among these few users with bitcoin, there is also a big gap between rich and poor.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/87NTAIB97N0tk5oLWC8Gl.jpg?height=524&width=1080)\\n\\nMost notably is that 91.7% of existing addresses on the bitcoin network hold less than 0.1BTC.In other words, holding a> 0.1BTC is equivalent to having more than 91.7% of all users in the Bitcoin world.This suggests that bitcoin's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a very few people.Among the richer users with> 0.1BTC, the richest group is usually known as giant whales (holding> 1,000 B T C).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TZlq58-eMIaDqa4_GJEeR.jpg?height=648&width=1080)\\n\\nFrom the figure above, the number of whales reached 2,490 on their peak on Feb. 28,2021) at about $43,500.After nearly a year of rise, the number of whales has fallen to 2,145, versus about $42,000.From February 8 to May 21 last year, some whales have completed a significant warehouse reduction action, the number began to enter the sideways shock range, and bitcoin after withstand the whale selling pressure, the price bottom is slowly rising.\\n\\n**The views and opinions
