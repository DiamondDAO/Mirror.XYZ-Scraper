"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Decentraland\\n\\nDecentraland is a software running on Ethereum that seeks to incentivize a global network of users to operate a shared virtual world.\\n\\nDecentraland users can buy and sell digital real estate, while exploring, interacting and playing games within this virtual world. Over time, the platform has evolved to implement interactive apps, in-world payments and peer-to-peer communication for users.\\n\\nTwo different types of tokens govern operations in Decentraland.\\n\\n\\tLAND – A non-fungible token (NFT) used to define the ownership of land parcels representing digital real estate.\\n\\n\\tMANA – A cryptocurrency that facilitates purchases of LAND, as well as virtual goods and services used in Decentraland. Changes to the Decentraland software are enacted through a collection of blockchain-based smart contacts, which allow participants who own MANA to vote on policy updates, land auctions and subsidies for new developments.\\n\\nEach parcel of LAND has a unique coordinate in the virtual world, an owner and a reference to a description file representing the content within the parcel.\\n\\nThe content layer controls what happens within each parcel, and includes various files required to render them:\\n\\n\\tContent Files – referencing all static audio and visuals\\n\\tScript Files – defining the placement and behavior of the referenced content\\n\\tInteraction Definition – peer-to-peer interactions such as gesturing, voice chat, and messaging.\\n\\nFinally, the real-time layer facilitates social interactions within Decentraland through user avatars, including voice chat and messaging.\\n\\nMarketplace and Builder\\n\\nOutside of the gaming environment, the Decentraland team has released a marketplace along with a drag-and-drop editor users can access to build scenes.\\n\\nThe marketplace enables participants to manage and exchange LAND tokens, priced in MANA. Owners can use the marketplace to transact or transfer parcels and other in-game items such as wearables and unique names.\\nSandbox\\n\\nThe Sandbox is a virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize their gaming experiences in the Ethereum blockchain.\\n\\nUsing The Sandbox's free software, such as VoxEdit and the Game Maker, players, artists and game designers can create ASSETs and experiences, such as games, dioramas and art galleries, for themselves and to share with others. These can be monetized to earn the creator passive income.\\n\\nThe Sandbox uses several token types to ensure a circular economy between all the types of users who will interact with the platform: players, creators, curators, and land owners:\\n\\n\\tSAND: the ERC-20 token used within The Sandbox as the basis for all of the ecosystem’s transactions and interactions.\\n\\tLAND: a digital piece of real estate in The Sandbox metaverse. Players buy LAND in order to populate it with games, assets and interactive experiences. Each LAND is a unique (non-fungible) token lying on the public Ethereum blockchain (ERC-721).\\n\\tASSETS: a token created by players who build/assemble user generated content (UGC). ASSETS utilize the ERC-1155 standard and can be traded on the marketplace, with their main utility being to serve as creation elements in The Sandbox Game Maker.\\n\\nSAND is an essential part of The Sandbox platform and was launched on the Binance trading platform in August, 2020. SAND is an ERC-20 utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain that will soon serve as the basis for transactions within The Sandbox, and has the following uses.\\n\\n\\tAccess The Sandbox platform: Players spend SAND in order to play games, buy equipment, or customize their Avatar character. Creators spend SAND to acquire ASSETS, LANDS, and through staking. LAND Sales will drive demand for SAND to purchase LANDS. Artists will spend SAND to upload ASSETS to the Marketplace and buy Gems for defining Rarity and Scarcity.\\n\\tGovernance: SAND is a governance token that allows holders to participate in Governance decisions on the platform, using a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure. They can exercise voting rights on key elements such as Foundation grant attributions to content and game creators and feature prioritization on the platform roadmap. SAND owners can vote themselves or delegate voting rights to other players of their choice.\\n\\tStaking: SAND allows for staking, which provides passive revenues on LANDS: you receive more SAND by staking it. This is also the only way to get valuable Gems and Catalysts, which are required for ASSET creation.\\n\\tFee Capture model = 5% of all transaction volume carried out in SAND tokens (Transaction Fees) will be charged, with 50% of the revenues going toward the Staking Pool as rewards for token holders who stake SAND tokens, and 50% to the ‘“Foundation.’’\\n\\tFoundation: The role of the Foundation is to support the ecosystem of The Sandbox, offering grants to incentivize high quality interactive content & game production on the platform. To date, the Foundation is funding more than 15 game projects and granted 100+ artists to produce NFTs ahead of the public launch. The overall valuation of the metaverse will grow through the valuation of all games funded by the Foundation, creating a virtuous circle to enable funding even bigger games and experiences.\\n\\nBloktopia(still early)\\nBloktopia is a Skyscraper made up of 21 levels to pay recognition to 21 million Bitcoin. It will act as a central hub and welcome all levels of crypto experience. For the first time ever, users will have access to crypto information and immersive content all in one place. Bloktopia’s vast user base will allow monetization through advertising and sponsorship providing an opportunity to share in revenue generation via an NFT mechanism.\\n\\nThe native token for Bloktopia is BLOK and will be used as the currency in Bloktopia. Token holders will be known as Bloktopians.\\n\\nAccess to Bloktopia will be free to all whether you’re a Bloktopian or not. However larger holdings of BLOK will give Bloktopian’s exclusive privileges.\\n\\nBloktopia will work on a Governance model. Reblok NFT holders will form part of that Governance council. Each NFT will vote via a DAO. Proposals will be made to the DAO where NFT holders will vote with the majority vote winning.\\n\\nBloktopia is a crypto focused hub that attracts crypto users & communities and therefore is a key opportunity for advertising & sponsorship to this captive audience for all business types. Sponsorship & Advertising will play a key role in generating BLOK tokens as revenue. BLOK will be awarded for community engagement & participation of events within Bloktopia.\\n\\nBLOK Tokens are used to run the network & can be staked to earn attractive APY.\\n \\nMy Neighbor Alice\\nMy Neighbor Alice is a multiplayer builder game, where anyone can buy and own virtual islands, collect and build exciting items and meet new friends.\\n\\nInspired by successful games such as Animal Crossing, the game combines the best of the two worlds - a fun narrative for regular players who want to enjoy the gameplay experience as well as an ecosystem for players who want to collect and trade NFT:s, even if they have no idea what an NFT is.\\n\\nALICE token is the native currency in the game. It allows token holders to play, invest and be part of the game.\\n\\n\\tPurchase Game Items\\nALICE can be used to purchase in-game assets, land and cosmetics for the avatar.\\n\\n\\tPlay to earn\\nUsers can earn ALICE tokens through participation in different in-game events, such as competitions.\\n\\n\\tStaking Rewards\\nALICE token can be used in the system to earn staking rewards. It is designed to encourage users to hold tokens and support the ecosystem.\\n\\n\\tGovernance\\nToken holders could participate in the decentralized governance process that decides on the use of revenues, game development and growth.\\n\\nOne of strategic visions within My Neighbor Alice is to create monetary incentives for the most committed and motivated players.\\n\\nStaking yield\\nBased on our staking and reward projections, we will allocate a fair amount of tokens on staking rewards. This will incentivize stakers to hold their tokens during the early stage of the game development when some game features will still be under development.\\n\\nNFT collateral\\nWhen a user buys NFT from the system, a percentage of the purchase price goes into a special collateral account associated with NFT. User then has an option to sell it back to the system (i.e. destroy the NFT) for the price equivalent to the locked collateral (or a percentage of it).\\n\\nNFT Rental\\nNFT:s, including land, can be rented to other players. The smart contract will make sure that the borrower cannot resell or destroy the object, and makes sure that the object returns to the owner when the rent period ends.\\n\\nDecentralized Governance\\nMy neighbor Alice aims to become a truly user-owned game with its own Decentralized organization called Community Council governed by the community.\\n\\nCollectively, users are able to decide on the use of revenue from island sales, in-game asset sales, and traditional game distribution channels. In the meantime, they can also decide on the project development schedule and token buy-back schemes.\\n\\nAxie Infinity\\n\\nThe game has two tokens, $SLP, which functions as a utility token on the platform, and $AXS, the governance token. To earn profit, any 2 Axies can be bred to produce a new Axie at the cost of 4 $AXS along with some $SLP tokens. The number of $SLP tokens required is determined by the number of combinations used for breeding.\\n\\nAxie Infinity Shards(AXS)\\nAxie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. AXS holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes.\\n\\nThe goal of AXS are:\\n\\tTo reward players for interacting with Axie Infinity while simultaneously incentivizing them to hold on to their tokens so they can claim additional rewards.\\n\\tTo decentralize the ownership and governance of Axie Infinity.\\n\\nUse cases:\\n\\n1. Governance(plan to launch on Q1 2022)\\n   The primary utility of $AXS tokens is governance. Unlike traditional games where the governance of the platforms is entirely upon the developers, on Axie Infinity, gamers and token holders govern the platform, for example the ‘Community Treasury’.\\n2. Payments\\n   $AXS enables users to facilitate payments for in-game purchases. Axie NFT marketplace accepts it as currency. It will also get you into certain sales/auctions conducted by the team. The number of tokens held will determine your eligibility for these events.\\n3. Staking\\n   Players can stake $AXS on the Axie Infinity protocol to reap weekly rewards and participate in governance voting. Staking will incentivize users to hold the tokens and support the growth of the gaming ecosystem.\\n\\n$AXS is distributed as rewards on Axie Infinity for playing, staking, and participation in voting. The number of tokens rewarded depends on your expertise in the game and involvement in community events.\\n\\nSmall Love Potions (SLP)\\nSmall Love Potions are needed for Axies to breed. Small Love Potions (SLP) can be rewarded to users for completing goals and achieving tasks in the game. Also, Small Love Potions can occasionally be found whilst discovering the depths of the Axie Infinity world.\\n\\nSmall Love Potions (SLP) are ERC-20 based currency tokens as opposed to the non-fungible ERC-721 token standard used for other in-game items. SLP tokens can be bought and sold on decentralized exchanges, such as Uniswap. If users have accrued SLP tokens in their Axie account and don’t want to use them to breed, there is an opportunity for users to profit and sell them on an exchange. Moreover, if players require extra love potions to breed their Axies and don’t want to wait until they’ve collected enough through the game, they can purchase extra SLP tokens through Uniswap.\",\"timestamp\":1639324182,\"title\":\"Metaverse tokens\"},\"digest\":\"SGLk31lVkG-0JpUVZUsWCvABX6LBR6cPaE3Qffodggk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4eb54c417e49a28BEa911d7bD53b014bA4ea4CCA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PQx4muZl1ynmIEqMy8Ms1WVYLfdVU4fc2IZBh7t2GUM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"622fI-ZLF8X9FLaqihUP4TY2cOCx2ejXVN5-vXHccFI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PwNApcSpVqN7uqFM6NkLw4jw1thAespYwT2fyygJuesIZyDO5uAs3QhWusPBHyuEJJKcqx-GKO0vwOb6fZLdOA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf7f484cddce3bd3498ff4dc0f07569c32879b55d30f57527272bcd5d6cc2260519ec49627fd83abc454cd462fd877d22f506d787096b2176857422040beab2561c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PQx4muZl1ynmIEqMy8Ms1WVYLfdVU4fc2IZBh7t2GUM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"622fI-ZLF8X9FLaqihUP4TY2cOCx2ejXVN5-vXHccFI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SGLk31lVkG-0JpUVZUsWCvABX6LBR6cPaE3Qffodggk\"}"
