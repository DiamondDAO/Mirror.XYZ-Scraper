"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**A story where humans play god and it does not turn out good for them(in a way that these species that they create are in every-way superior to the human race, they are united and they didn’t learn to create barriers like religion and caste and so on). They choose to ruin their lives unintentionally thinking they can get away with the chaos of the universe(try to prove the world that life exists on other planets basically targeting religion). SO what they do is basically send out life starting bacteria/chemicals that initiate a whole set of evolutionary moves played by the universe similar to a seed being thrown on land and somehow in due time you find a huge tree (artificial selection in evolution at play here like how we have so many species of dogs but they all started out by being plain old wolves.)**\\n\\n* **The story starts out with a scene in the astro bio lab where they are researching on the ammonia contents of the recent comet that we so proudly landed on. They choose to take these contents and sample them and send it on various spaceships to various earth like habitable planets (secretly) , as the main lead just graduates and plans on becoming an astronaut. \\n  \\n **\\n* **There are soo many alien life forms created due to this experiment big large ones ,small ones but one life form in particular are like homo sapiens but the only difference is that they work as one unit and use animals not like slaves/specimens but depend on them for activities such as hunting , farming,etc So there are bigger bad-er rhinos and tigers that went extinct on our planet. You might be thinking how they lost their primal instincts-to hunt and kill ? these particular species let’s call them clones for now genetically mutated them to co-inhabit with these majestic and powerful beasts. You might think that that’s odd but at least they didn’t take over their land and kill their Forests.**\\n\\n**So they live and chill with them just like humans and dogs. But clones train together with them beasts and developed a fighting style altogether called primal instinct.**\\n\\n* **So we thought we could breed out tiny little alien creatures to play god but so much as one experiment has to at least end up in a mess cause in this universe nothings perfect , neither the orbits of the planets nor the things we see or believe to be. Except the law of imperfection and chaos. That is absolute. There are so many meteors and asteroids that pass us and we don’t even know it , somehow we get lucky but this “luck” can and will run out eventually. So this would be an eye opener to the mass of cattle being moved around by these power holding people**\",\"timestamp\":1636913077,\"title\":\"Seed\"},\"digest\":\"W326GhZE8YWaz6GawpXeATOfxPFyafZXBXSn4DqBDWc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8082C3a5888c0C37aC653010c25f5360f9735406\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Rkrq8a199i6dF4ayr-hPAImcoFCHJNM0kPoVk3xnW90\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DAjAXApwQgFN2d43qjKdHLXkbFmF0yp6bnhzhoEzCAc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dZwd3IF5kAoeFXOobATZXoWNy4h3Wk7fwZ1QeeLsK65C5gbdE5qAknKu8W7tSbyMgRosncpu0hHAH1aTnf-lYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf4a71f82cf8dc6a3d83a8c6ea216daef0ea1b37852c843391d235ab9f0a0e0562aeb40576693e0d6fcac2e28273cfe2d03ddbbc627a6aa2d3cd89a69c3a6c0d21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Rkrq8a199i6dF4ayr-hPAImcoFCHJNM0kPoVk3xnW90\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DAjAXApwQgFN2d43qjKdHLXkbFmF0yp6bnhzhoEzCAc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"06g9npFvzvyLdb7rjK487_3UmxZgmo1Tl9dxctI4tAs\"}"
