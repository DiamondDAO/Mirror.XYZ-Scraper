And when you make assumptions, you are basically guessing. And the more specific the guess, the more likely it is that you’ll be wrong.\\n\\nIt’s based on a wide range of uncertainty.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors that go into making a prediction, and the odds of any one prediction being right or wrong are always wide. You cannot be 100% certain of anything that you believe about the path of the events and trends surrounding you. The more you try to drill down to the details, through expertise or analysis, the less useful the information you gain will be.\\n\\nIn a 2020 TIME article, Marc Koehler talked about the difference between generalist “Superforecaster” predictions and specialist predictions.\\n\\n> *“If you’re wondering how a virus rips through a herd, an epidemiologist is going to give you the best answers about whether it mutates and stuff like that,” says Koehler. “But when the herd turns into human beings who make decisions to comply or not comply with different guidelines, and when governments set policies about stay home or not at home, or keep schools open or not, when all of those different factors get involved, that’s where a group of human forecasters really excels.”*\\n\\n# The difference between specific and general predictions\\n\\nA general prediction refers to something that will have an impact on multiple fields, and will be the culmination of multiple threads. General predictions today would be that the world is going to have a dramatically different climate in 2050. Specific predictions would attempt to determine the temperature and how we got there. But that detailed data isn’t necessarily going to be useful to shape and modify the mindsets we need in order to respond to the climate crisis.\\n\\nAna Swanson, writing for the Washington Post, discusses the difference between educated prediction and expert prediction.\\n\\n> *“People are often spectacularly bad at forecasting the future. But they don’t have to be, says Philip Tetlock, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who has spent decades studying how people make predictions. In a new book, “[Superforecasting: The Art and Science of Prediction](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804136696?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creativeASIN=0804136696&linkCode=xm2&tag=thewaspos09-20),” which he co-wrote with journalist Dan Gardner, Tetlock argues that almost anyone can learn to peer into the future.*\\n>\\n> *Earlier in his career, Tetlock conducted [a famous 20-year study](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7959.html) in which he had a group of experts make a total of around 28,000 predictions about politics, war, economics and other topics over a timeline of one to 10 years. After scoring all of their predictions against what actually happened, Tetlock’s takeaway was that experts were only about as effective at predicting the future as dart-throwing chimpanzees.”*\\n\\nBecause of the limitations of predicting specific events, the ability to make general predictions becomes extremely valuable. You can make an incorrect prediction about the spread of an idea, but it’s better than a specific prediction that doesn’t include enough room to encompass a wider and more flexible world view; and in that failure, doesn’t give us useful datasets to build on.\\n\\nPhoto by [Austin Distel](https://unsplash.com/@austindistel?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)\\n\\nTo illustrate, imagine that you want to predict the birth of a child. When you can say “this is how likely it is for a baby to be born in **x conditions** in the next two weeks”, you are making a general prediction; a prediction based on birth rates and population data. If you want to predict the birth of a child named Arianna, with brown hair and green eyes, you’re reaching for a level of granularity that, while entirely possible with enough input, is not necessarily going to give you enough information to make it useful in determining a path to caring for that child.\\n\\nIn order to see a general prediction as a valuable insight, we need to go back to the simple concept of probability. How can we figure out the probability of a macro event based on the information we already have? How can we use that macro event to shape our actions? How can we take a larger prediction and make good use of that insight?\\n\\nInterviewed by Vox, epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security says that predictions shape behaviour — and behaviour shapes outcome.\\n\\n> *Even just going through the practice of finding out what the limits are, and being able to build that into our communications would be so helpful.*\\n>\\n> *If we can add more detail about the ways we might be right and the ways we might be wrong, and add more richness to the variables we think are influencing the outcome, that would be really helpful.*\\n>\\n> *Unlike the weather, with pandemics, we actually influence the outcome. … People see these numbers, and they are motivated then to be more vigilant about staying home and doing all the things that change that outcome.*\\n\\nIn the climate prediction business, forecasts that look too much like a weather report have a bad reputation. Weather forecasters like to point out a rainy or cloudy day and say that the weather will become worse or better in a short time. But the short-term, changing nature of the weather means that the specific predictions can fall short. A forecast that calls for windy conditions might be met with scepticism because a forecast for clouds and no rain ruined someone’s proverbial parade the day before.\\n\\nBut forecasters who try to forecast the impact of climate change, when they know the weather may be good for a week but bad for a few months, could make up for those inaccurate specific predictions. Good weather forecasters look for general trends. With climate prediction, we also have to watch for general trends, such as a warmer climate with less water, and we need to watch for events that confirm our predictions.\\n\\nWearable technologies, finance, personal health, smart cities, manufacturing, software applications and insurance are all up for predictive grabs. At the same time, traditional businesses are experiencing disruption from startups that leverage analysis big data, creating platforms that perform predictions to enable customers to buy products without friction. It’s a world where forecasting becomes more and more important, and where detailed forecasting becomes less reliable, less encompassing and less foundational. We move and shift too fast to be able to rely on micro predictions, and we can’t afford to ignore the macro.\\n\\nOn a daily basis, we all use a combination of algorithmic and manual analysis to construct our Future Outlooks. Once we can recognise the limitations of becoming too specific and granular, we can attempt to make broader and more reliable predictions about the future, and make better decisions in the process.\",\"timestamp\":1637140269,\"title\":\"Specific Predictions Rarely Hold Any Value\"},\"digest\":\"c0sWxHNLq2FLXGtX9b2U0ETrpNxUX2cc5PpMqZvtEtk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdEb3348Eb6fa98193cE2229a5B71175edb5F5f76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BVf80R5jZ2VpWpgjOiXjvrVKfLZayXJZRGpk73kJCpo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pyMzHpK2x-unFp4Q2rSrZLHNaOXnTNknR6x7zHAan8I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Nc7LxePGFP8N0vBLMgnuFFwfmhNbT7Lde22OioBtRr_ZBDVCFHYvbq5xu1hS4eXwJ25Q1vVwUZkokWuQsyM0NQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7bbb3a3ef297ed40a306b74fac25a4a71670150d0c8c24e706ac34962ef4d66932838a1fbfdda80fe9aa40c85927e64a50465076a0a63e3df1d5e8bccff65e1d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BVf80R5jZ2VpWpgjOiXjvrVKfLZayXJZRGpk73kJCpo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"pyMzHpK2x-unFp4Q2rSrZLHNaOXnTNknR6x7zHAan8I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"c0sWxHNLq2FLXGtX9b2U0ETrpNxUX2cc5PpMqZvtEtk\"}"
