"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A thought came up this afternoon to help us take a different marketing strategy. Here is how it works.\\n\\nInstead of making both Items and Faces for sale at a price of 0.03ETH in Round 0, Maggie proposed to make the Faces for free. The reason to make the face for free can be following:\\n\\n1. **Lower Barrier of Entrance**: Since MYPUNKS is a new kind of NFT project by combining two types of NFT, the cost to try out this new project is relatively high on the ETH network. Thus, it is possible to lower the cost of entrance by setting the face for free.\\n2. **High Gas Fee**: We want to sell both NFT with 0.03ETH at first. However, the gas fee on ETH is very high. If the price for NFT is too low, then the user will have to pay the doubled price. We will need to adjust the price and make it higher. \\n3. **Attract Early Holders**: By making the Face for free, it is possible to attract early holders of MYPUNKS Face. If the Face is minted for free, then it has almost zero valuation. (maybe some rare faces will have some high valuation). People will have to buy the items to equip on the face to make the NFT values higher.  \\n\\nThen another question raised to me is: If we make the face for free, how do we structure the sale? So there are two options that we can consider.\\n\\n### Option 1:\\n\\nStart the Face Minting, and make all 6666 Faces Mint for free. Limited Time only. When the time is over, no Faces are able to mint. This may create a FOMO of scarcity. **Each address can claim up to 5 Faces for free**.\\n\\n**Risk**: \\n\\n1. Not many people notice the project, the face has been minted a little. \\n2. All faces are minted, but a few items are sold. Very low return.\\n\\n**Advantages**:\\n\\n1. If all faces can be minted, then we can attract a decent amount of holders.\\n2. People can FOMO in the Faces and then buy the items.\\n\\n### Option2:\\n\\nStart the Face Minting in Round Basis, meanwhile selling those Items. For example, we can release 1000 Faces for free mint and sell 1000 items at the same time. And then, the face will be gradually released each round for free minting (6666 in total). **Each address can claim 2 Faces at maximum for free**. \\n\\nRisk:\\n\\n1. People mint the faces for free but do not mint the items.\\n\\nAdvantage:\\n\\n1. We can test out how the minting goes and it’s more flexible. \\n2. We can make money by item minting in each round. If people like this product, they will come back for more.\\n\\nSince the faces are can be claimed for free, we should set a limited on how much each address can claim each round, or in total. \\n\\n### Scarcity of Face\\n\\nAnother thing I am wondering about is the scarcity of the Face. If we decide to make the Face free, then there are two ways:\\n\\n1. Stick to the limited supply of 6666 Faces, and make it exclusive. No more designs are created.\\n2. Create flexibility to increase the supply of Faces in the future if needed. This allows us or the community to create more designs on the faces.\\n\\n## What about the Whitelists?\\n\\nIf we decide to go for this strategy, there will be a huge change. We definitely need to spend some time on changing the contracts (but not too much work), and work around the current marketing situations.\\n\\n### Ouro Whitelist Members\\n\\nOuro whitelisted members can mint a free Ouro Face. It’s their choice to pay for the Ouro Item. Instead of specifying Face or Item for each address, we will provide them with a set. \\n\\n### Round 0 Whitelist Members\\n\\nThis can be hard to adjust and we definitely need to provide compensation for these early supporters. There are various ways for consideration.\\n\\n1. Stick to the Whitelisted Only Round. If people are whitelisted, they would be able to claim a face for free and purchase the item. \\n2. Remove the idea of being whitelisted and make Round 0 a public sale, letting more people participate in this sale.\\n\\n## A Change on Supply\\n\\n1. Face Original: 6666\\n2. Item Original: 9999\\n\\nSince we are making Face for free, we can then focus on the sale of the items. It is necessary to make the items more expansive, as well as increase the supply to allow more variations.\\n\\nProposed Change on Total Supply:\\n\\n1. Face → 6666 / 9999 (0 ETH)\\n2. Item  → 16666 / 12321 / 19999 (0.05 ETH → 0.06ETH → 0.07ETH)\\n\\n## A Change on Sale\\n\\n### Face Release\\n\\nR0: 20%\\n\\nR1: 20%\\n\\nR2: 20%\\n\\nR3: 20%\\n\\nR4: 20%\\n\\nR5: 20%\\n\\nIf we are using the round strategy, then, there are two ways of working around the Item:\\n\\n1. Make the Item sale as the same round of face releasing. Thus, when all items are sold, then we release the next 20% of the free faces. In this way, items are sold in a fixed price in each round.\\n2. Make the Item sale independent of the face releasing. In this way, face releasing will be set in a certain period (eg. 3 days for around). Item sale time is infinite, so it will terminate when all items are sold. Price will increase slightly for each round. The rounds can be different than the faces. For example\\n\\n```\\n0 - 1999 → 0.04 ETH\\n\\n1999 - 3999 → 0.05 ETH\\n\\n3999 - 7999 → 0.06 ETH\\n\\n7999 - 15999 → 0.07 ETH\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1641469396,\"title\":\"MYPUNKS Sale Proposal\"},\"digest\":\"ZUUCfxs5sy-Bnbx1YlbXAjZ2X26dOPIyBi2PV20B5Co\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEcBeBC5F295C05BfDeC51bdCFDafB02D2E9a1179\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8aGwu3pksVbPXjKQ5VDxL6ta6Z_UyiHf39B3q5eZkIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Iec8SFqMuiiROdrSaNsyMKu1E0gwd2WzYqULO0sSO5k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kNgHMxc6qgQ1NAByo-dtP7i420RYiNtfykEZC7vdDJlkUeIXCP0FK0E-Ik2pdeaO-znf63Y4ECwmHg_eRfkJ7Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x64d12dab579a4759a6331fcc178950e73ecc07590abebaa5c94f6fa3213b895e7158ec1fbe3453aa55b9ebb57fc009d16ea60827cb546c6161bc724ac59ab1231c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8aGwu3pksVbPXjKQ5VDxL6ta6Z_UyiHf39B3q5eZkIw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Iec8SFqMuiiROdrSaNsyMKu1E0gwd2WzYqULO0sSO5k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZUUCfxs5sy-Bnbx1YlbXAjZ2X26dOPIyBi2PV20B5Co\"}"
