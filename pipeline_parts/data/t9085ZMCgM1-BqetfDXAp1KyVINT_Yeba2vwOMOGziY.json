"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My artistic exploration and experience have been attempts at making unconscious interpretations of my existence.\\n\\nThey are spontaneous bursts of unknowns. It is almost as if I wake up from a dream when I see what I have written/made/photographed; I wake up and come up with an attempt at an interpretation.\\n\\nWhat if I want to dream lucidly? What if I wanted to make art more consciously, and intentionally. What if I wanted a longer stay, and not a brief, intense dream?\\n\\nGuiding the making of my work from an unconscious attempt to a more conscious one means I will be able to focus on refining my craft. After a series of more conscious attempts, I will be able to make art that lives up to my ideals. I will be more objective in the way I absorb my art, and critique it.\\n\\nI decided it is best to ask people to ask me questions. In this article, I have included those questions and attempt to answer them. And I shared them, in hopes I succeeded in doing so.\\n\\nThe answers will not end here and now. They will continue to evolve in my makings, in my writings, and thought. My written work may evolve into a series of writings that will then develop into a book one day. I am hopeful it will. God willing, of course.\\n\\nI am writing this in the middle of the night. Hurrying so midnight clock doesn’tstrike before I am done with it. Because if it does, I must stop typing, and go to sleep. I must sleep. I need it.\\n\\nI will dive in to the questions now.\\n\\n# What is the core theme or central question of your artistic exploration?\\n\\n[Biniyam](https://www.instagram.com/biniyam_ta/) asked this question.\\n\\nMy artistic explorations are informed by my encounters and experiences. On each piece is a scar of time, a thesis of my existence, and a sense of “ordinary”. This is especially true in my earlier work. Photography has allowed me to find solace in stillness.\\n\\nMy current artistic explorations are more focused on studying techniques, and tools that help or hinder the fullest expression of my experiences and encounters.\\n\\nI always hope to find universality in my personal experiences and encounters. I want my own stories to relate to yours, yours, and yes, yours too.\\n\\nI am currently focused on examining grief, love, sorrow, beauty, and how all of those are seen in the day-to-day. Those have been a running theme since 2018. I want to keep digging.\\n\\nMy process is quite simple. I just make. I don’t think much. I make. It has been different for different scenarios. If it is a project, I obsess about the subject matter but in a more introverted way; I make sure I don’t read about the subject. I make sure I don’t ask others about it. That is what I did for Sparse Density. I just went and took the photos.\\n\\nThere is a prevalent subject to my work; a single, insignificant human being’s lifetime of encounters and experiences.\\n\\n# How do you process the difference between creation and reception?\\n\\n[Biniyam](https://www.instagram.com/biniyam_ta/) asked this question.\\n\\nTo make sure I fully understand your question, I will first restate the question. I will provide my answer.\\n\\nHow do I discern when I’m making something (as a human being, I am not a creator; I am a maker. Only The Most High is the creator.), and receiving it.\\n\\n# How do you measure the value of something you’ve created?\\n\\n[Biniyam](https://www.instagram.com/biniyam_ta/) asked this question.\\n\\nI assume, by value, you mean monetary value.\\n\\nI never sold my art until I stepped into NFTs. That’s when I realized I need to make conscious pricing choices. I am still learning. This is what I know.\\n\\nI must first breakdown what selling and ownership means for art. The artist is doing what s/he loves. As soon as s/he starts to sell, s/he starts doing what s/he loves for a living. Although pricing any artwork is limiting its potential for unlimited growth, this is the real world. Selling is an artist’s willingness to let their creative abilities drive their power to acquire more tools, and a standard of life that helps them do what they love for a living for longer periods of time.\\n\\nWhen pricing my work, I consider these 4 factors:\\n\\n* **How much it means to me.** At first, I was attached to all of my work that I thought each one should be priced well. Each piece means the world to me. Pricing it meant limiting it. But I started to understand the need to do what I love for a living requires me to make sober pricing decisions.\\n* **How much a collector would be willing to pay.** At this point, I ask myself would I buy this? We are our own worst critic; the first thing I hear myself say is no. If I ever reach a yes— which, owing to my daily art practice, I am reaching that more frequently — I would ask if I’d buy it at this price point. This is the time that I need to sober up. Here, I consider two things: a) do I have a reputable, recognizable brand? b) do I need the money so much that I sacrifice my art’s value?\\n\\n  I’ll be honest, this factor is the least fair among them. It helps me sober up. But it does not help me find the right price because I expect to insert myself into another person’s mind and see myself as objectively as possible. Empathy is overrated here.\\n* **How much value it adds.** I want people to feel things when they see my work. I want people to find their scars and the light through which it shines. I want my audience to pause, stop, and stare. The question for my artwork thus becomes, “how moving is this piece?“ I go around and ask about my work. I do a bit of a show-and-tell. I ask why people like it. The more descriptive they are, the more moving the artwork is.\\n\\n  I also leave the piece alone for a while, come back, and look at it. I see if it moves ME. If it does, then it will go on sale. At this point, selling equates to my intention to share the experience of experiencing the art work. Thus, it makes sense to make 1/1’s to share experiences that are more personal and unique.\\n* **How well-done, well-crafted, well-thought it is.** Intentions matter. In visual art, intentions are visible. The questions like, “How clear is it? Can you see each of my intentions? Are there any unintended pixelations, aberrations, errors?” are mere beginnings. If my artwork is well and clear intentioned, it is visible in the artwork itself. If it is not, you will see what I consider low quality art.\\n\\n  I have produced what I consider low-quality art because there was no intention besides trying to fill a frame. This still happens. I enjoy it when it does because it is a lesson.\\n\\n# What things usually trigger an idea in your mind? (Where do you get inspiration from most?)\\n\\n[Biniyam](https://www.instagram.com/biniyam_ta/) asked this.\\n\\nAs makers, we have an ability to take something unknown and communicate it using known language. This known language could be spoken or written language, hence the beauty of poetry; it could also be visual language, hence the beauty of visual arts (painting, sculpting, photography, videography, etc.).\\n\\nIntrinsically, my work is inspired by my encounters and experiences as a human being. So much of my work has been inspired by loss, grief, love, being human — and more recently, Spiritual Experiences, and Beauty. It is motivated by the mere existence of God.\\n\\nExtrinsically, I am keen to explore different techniques to make the most powerful form of communication. To try out different techniques, I let listening to other artists, their biographies, their process inspire my process. Recently, I was inspired by [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon_(artist)) and [Jean-Michel Basquiat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Michel_Basquiat).\\n\\n# What is the one common thing in your arts?\\n\\n[Aman Asres](https://www.instagram.com/aman_asres/) asked this question.\\n\\nI assume you mean theme.\\n\\nI have addressed the common theme(s) of my work above. I will elaborate on the visual theme(s) below.\\n\\nYou may have seen halos in my work. Those are curiosities about what it means to be a righteous human being when we carry such darkness as a species. How easy/difficult is it to be righteous in a gray, if not DARK world?\\n\\nI am shifting more and more into self-portraits because I intend to use myself, my encounters, my experiences as a starting point. My hope is to show my audience their own experiences through mine. In my work, I hope to be a mirror.\\n\\n# What stories are you trying to tell? What values do you hold dear?\\n\\n[Christian](https://www.instagram.com/chris_gedion/) asked this.\\n\\nIt is different with each artwork. In general, I hope to entice spiritual, mental, and emotional connections by pushing for more introspection.\\n\\nI would like my audience to look deep down inside. To never feel like they are the only one going through the motions. I would like my audience to know that such experiences, often considered VERY personal experiences, are often quite universal.\\n\\nSubjects of mental, and emotional well-being are at the heart of what I mostly make.\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\nThank you for reading.
