"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Increasingly, [Computer Aided Governance](https://medium.com/block-science/computer-aided-governance-cag-a-revolution-in-automated-decision-support-systems-9faa009e57a2) is a methodology used in DAOs and decentralized projects to improve the quality of decisions made by incorporating evidence from data, analysis, and various types of modeling including integrative ‚Äúcomplex systems‚Äù simulation modeling.**\\n\\nIn general, the types of evidence used during the course of DAO governance decision making, from most to least ‚Äúvalue added‚Äù are: Reports / Analyses; Integrative Simulation Models; Supervised AI / ML / Statistical Models; Clustering and Unsupervised Learning; Data Visualization; Raw Data.\\n\\nThe figure below describes a prototypical Evidence-Based decision making process that incorporates Computer Aided Governance.\\n\\n![](https://mirror.xyz/\\\\_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.mirror-media.xyz%2Fpublication-images%2FIvMzEYEkt3vRgBZGWy92K.png\\\\&w=3840\\\\&q=90)\\n\\n**The \\\\[REDACTED] DAO will have a forum with subsections dedicated to a variety of topics including governance-related discussions. Specifically, a subsection where data science and modeling contributors are dedicated to sourcing, sharing, and discussing evidence in support of decision making.**\\n\\nAt the outset, imagine a proposal for a decision is before the DAO - such as deciding what collateral to accept to the bonding during the next epoch. To support this decision, data is collected and analyzed with the help of simulation and other models, and the analysis is discussed by decision makers. As a consequence of the discussion, it may be apparent that more evidence will be needed in order to arrive at an informed decision, in which case more data is collected, analyzed and discussed.\\n\\nIf it is apparent from the discussion that there is enough evidence to form a rough consensus around the decision, then the process moves to a binding vote. Once the decision is actuated, the state of the DAO, the controlled system, and the environment changes, which generates new information that can lead to additional questions and decisions in the future.\\n\\nHere, we leave out routine *data science* details such as sourcing, cleaning, and transforming raw data into something more convenient for creating models and analysis. Additional extensions that clearly can occur, but are not discussed explicitly here are that multiple decisions (and their processes) can be happening at once, for example, if there are multiple matters for the DAO to decide at the same time.\\n\\nIn the future we anticipate that this loop will become increasingly automated for some types of operational decisions such as real-time parameter adjustments. This process would see removed the human mediated stages, and replacing voting with AI or rules based decision making, becoming a more typical control loop.\\n\\n### How does this look in the case of \\\\[REDACTED]?\\n\\nImagine that there‚Äôs a proposal before the DAO governance to whether to include a new asset type. Then, the sub-section dedicated to this decision would have a number of posts including high-level reports built on earlier, foundational analyses. Take for example the \\\"Token Economics Report\\\" which combines and discusses evidence including models and analyses previously posted to the forum.\\n\\n![Figure 2.

A selection of forum post titles is shown, with the \\\"Token Economics Report\\\" showing which previous posts it refers to and builds upon.\\n\\nWithin the DAO governance community, normative behaviors are assumed to arise and be reinforced, such as voters informing their vote with the best evidence, and also favouring evidence that clearly references source material (analysis, models, or raw data).\\n\\n![Figure 3.

In protocols such as ours, with many moving levers, it is critical that we incorporate the attribution in evidence-based governance of a DAO.
