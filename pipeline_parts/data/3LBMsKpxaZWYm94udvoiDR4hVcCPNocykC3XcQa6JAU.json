"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I stumbled into the CONCAVE cave via a twitter, via a twitter.  Isn’t that how most crypto stumbles happen?  An OHMie, just reading other OHMie post, and somehow, I was led… ok let’s not be dramatic I just clicked on a message that led me to really want entrance into this CONCAVE discord server.  And after many attempts, I got in.  I had no idea what to expect other than I think it had something to do with OHM so I was willing to diver deeper.  Into the CAVE.  And so I did.\\n\\nGo ahead and read other posts for roles and what to do once you enter into this world of inclusion, peace, helpfulness… my interest was in the DIVE.. why are we here?  What is this all for?  I quickly realized only WE determine that why.  There may be a layout, a groundwork, just like my walk everyday is grounded, but what is around, above, below..\\n\\nConcave helped me to remember that.  As above, so below.  But that’s another story.. Concave got me really thinking.  How can this be applied to the state of DEFI, to OHM, to crypto as a whole?  And then I saw others piling in ideas that WE are the base for all to be achieved.  In honor, in co-opetition and collaboration.\\n\\nI dove deeper because it was all going exactly in line with my understanding that life is, as we know it, just a game. Not to say you can or can’t take it seriously, but it is a game.  You decide how you want to play it.\\n\\nPlay it with integrity.  Or play it like a fool.  But it’s okay because in the cave, you can realize your foolishness as a troll, and all will be okay.  We are all the same, no one is better than another.  I’m not good at making MEME’s or have the humor, and I don’t have the organization of the documentooors.  I belong in the world of research because I love the history and made up believe history and ideas that shape our world.  Just like a basketball game you may play all roles as a scorer, rebounder, or defender, but in the end you can really shine where it feels right.\\n\\nConcave is bringing people together to bring out the best in them.  We all have something to give.  And this is the power in numbers.  We are powerful once we know we ‘have power’, but we are even more powerful once we know we can unite and use these powers for good.  \\n\\nThe few do not need to control currency, or anything for that matter.  It can be won by all that play an awesome game.  Not to say you, yourself are not your own individual self.. you are.  This is the paradox.  You can be YOU, and shine your light for ALL to prosper.  Do not go ‘along’ just to ‘get along’.  Be bold, be you.  Dig deep.\\n\\nIn this real world of the CONCAVE, we all have a place, and a part to play.  Where do you fit best? If you’re not sure, it’s okay.  Jump in and see what happens.  It’s a spoon, there are no falling through the cracks.
