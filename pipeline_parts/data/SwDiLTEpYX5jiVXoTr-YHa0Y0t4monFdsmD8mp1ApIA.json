"{\"content\":{\"body\":\".  I will rather take one of the ministers who was presented to one of the parishes of Mansoul, and shall thus let you see how that State Church worked out practically in one of its ministers at any rate.  And the preacher and pastor I shall so take up was neither the best minister in the town nor the worst; but, while a long way subordinate to the best, he was also by no means the least.  The Reverend Mr. Conscience was our parish minister's name; his people sometimes called him The Recorder.\\n\\n1. Well, then, to begin with, the Rev. Mr. Conscience was a native of the same town in which his parish church now stood.  I am not going to challenge the wisdom of the patron who appointed his protege to this particular living; only, I have known very good ministers who never got over the misfortune of having been settled in the same town in which they had been born and brought up.  Or, rather, their people never got over it.  One excellent minister, especially, I once knew, whose father had been a working man in the town, and his son had sometimes assisted his father before he went to college, and even between his college sessions, and the people he afterwards came to teach could never get over that.  It was not wise in my friend to accept that presentation in the circumstances, as the event abundantly proved.  For, whenever he had to take his stand in his pulpit or in his pastorate against any of their evil ways, his people defended themselves and retaliated on him by reminding him that they knew his father and his mother, and had not forgotten his own early days.  No doubt, in the case of Emmanuel and Mansoul and its minister, there were counterbalancing considerations and advantages both to minister and people; but it is not always so; and it was not so in the case of my unfortunate friend.\\n\\nForasmuch, so ran the Prince's presentation paper, as he is a native of the town of Mansoul, and thus has personal knowledge of all the laws and customs of the corporation, therefore he, the Prince, presented Mr. Conscience.  That is to say, every man who is to be the minister of a parish should make his own heart and his own life his first parish.  His own vineyard should be his first knowledge and his first care.  And then out of that and after that he will be able to speak to his people, and to correct, and counsel, and take care of them.  In Thomas Boston's Memoirs we continually come on entries like this:  'Preached on Ps. xlii. 5, and mostly on my own account.'  And, again, we read in the same invaluable book for parish ministers, that its author did not wonder to hear that good had been done by last Sabbath's sermon, because he had preached it to himself and had got good to himself out of it before he took it to the pulpit.  Boston kept his eye on himself in a way that the minister of Mansoul himself could not have excelled.  Till, not in his pulpit work only, but in such conventional, commonplace, and monotonous exercises as his family worship, he so read the Scriptures and so sang the psalms that his family worship was continually yielding him fruit as well as his public ministry.  As our family worship and our public ministry will do, too, when we have the eye and the heart and the conscience that Thomas Boston had.  'I went to hear a preacher,' said Pascal, 'and I found a man in the pulpit.'  Well, the parish minister of Mansoul was a man, and so was the parish minister of Ettrick.  And that was the reason that the people of Simprin and Ettrick so often thought that Boston had them in his eye.  Good pastor as he was, he could not have everybody in his eye.  But he had himself in his eye, and that let him into the hearts and the homes of all his people.  He was a true man, and thus a true minister.\\n\\n1. Both Boston and the minister of Mansoul were well-read men also; so, indeed, in as many words, their fine biographies assure us.  But that is just another way of saying what has been said about those two ministers over and over again already.  William Law never was a parish minister.  The English Crown of that day would not trust him with a parish.  But what was the everlasting loss of some parish in England has become the everlasting gain of the whole Church of Christ.  Law's enforced seclusion from outward ministerial activity only set him the more free to that inward activity which has been such a blessing to so many, and to so many ministers especially.  And as to this of every minister being well read, that master in Israel says:  'Above all, let me tell you that the book of books to you is your own heart, in which are written and engraven the deepest lessons of divine instruction.  Learn, therefore, to be deeply attentive to the presence of God in your own hearts, who is always speaking, always instructing, always illuminating the heart that is attentive to Him.'  Jonathan Edwards called the poor parish minister of Ettrick 'a truly great divine.' But Law goes on to say, 'A great divine is but a cant expression unless it signifies a man greatly advanced in the divine life.  A great divine is one whose own experience and example are a demonstration of the reality of all the graces and virtues of the gospel.  No divine has any more of the gospel in him than that which proves itself by the spirit, the actions, and the form of his life:  the rest is but hypocrisy, not divinity.'  Let all our parish ministers, then, give themselves to this kind of reading. Let them all aim at a doctor's degree in the divinity of their own hearts.\\n2. We are done at last, and we are done for ever, in Scotland, with patrons and with presenters; but I daresay our most Free Church people would be quite willing to surrender their dear-bought franchise if the old plan could even yet be made to work in all their parishes as it worked in Mansoul.  For not only was the presented minister in this case a well-read man; he was also, what the best of the Scottish people have always loved and honoured, a man, as this history testifies, with a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled with judgment.  In Scotland we like our minister to have a tongue bravely hung, even when that is proved to our own despite.  When any minister, parish minister or other, is seen to tune his pulpit, our respect for him is gone.  The Presbyterian pulpit has been proverbially hard to tune, and it will be an ill day when it becomes easy.  'Here lies a man who had a brow for every good cause.'  So it was engraven over one of Boston's elders. And so is it always:  like priest, like people in the matter of the hang of the minister's tongue and in the boldness of the elder's brow.\\n\\n'Bravely hung' is an ancient and excellent expression which has several shades of meaning in Bunyan.  But in the present instance its meaning is modified and fixed by judgment.  A bravely hung tongue; at the same time the parish minister of Mansoul's tongue was not a loosely-hung tongue.  It was not a blustering, headlong, scolding, untamed tongue.  The pulpit of Mansoul was tuned with judgment.  He who filled that pulpit had a head filled with judgment.  The ground of judgment is knowledge, and the minister of Mansoul was a man of knowledge.  It was his early and ever- increasing knowledge of himself, and thus of other men; and then it was his excellent judgment as to the use he was to make of that knowledge; it was his sound knowledge what to say, when to say it, and how to say it,--it was all this that decided his Prince to make him the minister of Mansoul.  How excellent and how rare a gift is judgment--judgment in counsel, judgment in speech, and judgment in action!  'I am very little serviceable with reference to public management,' writes the parish minister of Ettrick, 'being exceedingly defective in ecclesiastical prudence; but the Lord has given me a pulpit gift, not unacceptable:  and who knows what He may do with me in that way?'  Who knows, indeed!  Now, there are many parish ministers who have a not unacceptable pulpit gift, and yet who are not content with that, but are always burying that gift in the earth and running away from it to attempt a public management in which they are exceedingly and conspicuously defective.  Now, why do they do that?  Is their pulpit and their parish not sphere and opportunity enough for them?  Mine is a small parish, said Boston, but then it is mine.  And a small parish may both rear and occupy a truly great divine.  Let those ministers, then, who are defective in ecclesiastical prudence not be too much cast down.  Ecclesiastical prudence is not in every case the highest kind of prudence.  The presbytery, the synod, and the assembly are not any minister's first or best sphere.  Every minister's first and best sphere is his parish.  And the presbytery is not the end of the parish.  The parish, the pastorate, and the pulpit are the end of both presbytery and synod and assembly.  As for the minister of Mansoul, he was a well-read man, and also a man of courage to speak out the truth at every occasion, and he had a tongue as bravely hung as he had a head filled with judgment.\\n\\n1. But there was one thing about the parish pulpit of Mansoul that always overpowered the people.  They could not always explain it even to themselves what it was that sometimes so terrified them, and, sometimes, again, so enthralled them.  They would say sometimes that their minister was more than a mere man; that he was a prophet and a seer, and that his Master seemed sometimes to stand and speak again in His servant.  And 'seer' was not at all an inappropriate name for their minister, so far as I can collect out of some remains of his that I have seen and some testimonies that I have heard.  There was something awful and overawing, something seer-like and supernatural, in the pulpit of Mansoul.  Sometimes the iron chains in which the preacher climbed up into the pulpit, and in which he both prayed and preached, struck a chill to every heart; and sometimes the garment of salvation in which he shone carried all their hearts captive.  Some Sabbath mornings they saw it in his face and heard it in his voice that he had been on his bed in hell all last night; and then, next Sabbath, those who came back saw him descending into his pulpit from his throne in heaven.\\n\\n'Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-page Foretells the nature of a tragic volume. Thou tremblest, and the whiteness in thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue to tell thine errand.'\\n\\nIf you think that I am exaggerating and magnifying the parish pulpit of Mansoul, take this out of the parish records for yourselves.  'And now,' you will read in one place, 'it was a day gloomy and dark, a day of clouds and thick darkness with Mansoul. Well, when the Sabbath-day was come he took for his text that in the prophet Jonah, \\\"They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.\\\"  And then there was such power and authority in that sermon, and such dejection seen in the countenances of the people that day that the like had seldom been heard or seen.  The people, when the sermon was done, were scarce able to go to their homes, or to betake themselves to their employments the whole week after. They were so sermon-smitten that they knew not what to do.  For not only did their preacher show to Mansoul its sin, but he did tremble before them under the sense of his own, still crying out as he preached, Unhappy man that I am! that I, a preacher, should have lived so senselessly and so sottishly in my parish, and be one of the foremost in its transgressions!  With these things he also charged all the lords and gentry of Mansoul to the almost distracting of them.'  It was Sabbaths like that that made the people of Mansoul call their minister a seer.\\n\\n1. And, then, there was another thing that I do not know how better to describe than by calling it the true catholicity, the true humility, and the true hospitality of the man.  It is true he had no choice in the matter, for in setting up a standing ministry in Mansoul Emmanuel had done so with this reservation and addition. We have His very words.  'Not that you are to have your ministers alone,' He said.  'For my four captains, they can, if need be, and if they be required, not only privately inform, but publicly preach both good and wholesome doctrine, that, if heeded, will do thee good in the end.'  Which, again, reminds me of what Oliver Cromwell wrote to the Honourable Colonel Hacker at Peebles.  'These:  I was not satisfied with your last speech to me about Empson, that he was a better preacher than fighter--or words to that effect.  Truly, I think that he that prays and preaches best will fight best.  I know nothing that will give like courage and confidence as the knowledge of God in Christ will.  I pray you to receive Captain Empson lovingly.'\\n2. The standing ministry in Mansoul was endowed also; but I cannot imagine what the court of teinds would make of the instrument of endowment.  As it has been handed down to us, that old ecclesiastical instrument reads more like a lesson in the parish minister's class for the study of Mysticism than a writing for a learned lord to adjudicate upon.  Here is the Order of Council: 'Therefore I, thy Prince, give thee, My servant, leave and licence to go when thou wilt to My fountain, My conduit, and there to drink freely of the blood of My grape, for My conduit doth always run wine.  Thus doing, thou shalt drive from thine heart all foul, gross, and hurtful humours.  It will also lighten thine eyes, and it will strengthen thy memory for the reception and the keeping of all that My Father's noble secretary will teach thee.'  Thus the Prince did put Mr. Conscience into the place and office of a minister to Mansoul, and the chosen and presented man did thankfully accept thereof.\\n\\n(1)  Now, there are at least three lessons taught us here.  There is, to begin with, a lesson to all those congregations who are about to choose a minister.  Let all those congregations, then, who have had devolved on them the powers of the old patrons,--let them make their election on the same principles that the Prince of Mansoul patronised.  Let them choose a probationer who, young though he must be, has the making of a seer in him.  Let them listen for the future seer in his most stammering prayers. Somewhere, even in one service, his conscience will make itself heard, if he has a conscience.  Rather remain ten years vacant than call a minister who has no conscience.  The parish minister of Mansoul sometimes seemed to be all conscience, and it was this that made his head so full of judgment, his tongue so full of a brave boldness, and his heart so full of holy love.  Your minister may be an anointed bishop, he may be a gowned and hooded doctor, he may be a king's chaplain, he may be the minister of the largest and the richest and the most learned parish in the city, but, unless he strikes terror and pain into your conscience every Sabbath, unless he makes you tremble every Sabbath under the eye and the hand of God, he is no true minister to you.  As Goodwin says, he is a wooden cannon.  As Leighton says, he is a mountebank for a minister.\\n\\n(2)  The second lesson is to all those who are politically enfranchised, and who hold a vote for a member of Parliament.  Now, crowds of candidates and their canvassers will before long be at your door besieging it and begging you for your vote for or against an Established church.  Well, before Parliament is dissolved, and the canvass commences, look you well into your own heart and ask yourself whether or no the Church of Christ has yet been established there.  Ask if Jesus Christ, the Head of the Church, has yet set up His throne there, in your heart.  Ask your conscience if His laws are recognised and obeyed there.  Ask also if His blood has been sprinkled there, and since when.  And, if not, then it needs no seer to tell you what sacrilege, what profanity it is for you to touch the ark of God:  to speak, or to vote, or to lift a finger either for or against any church whatsoever.  Intrude your wilful ignorance and your wicked passions anywhere else.  March up boldly and vote defiantly on questions of State that you never read a sober line about, and are as ignorant about as you are of Hebrew; but beware of touching by a thousand miles the things for which the Son of God laid down His life. Thrust yourself in, if you must, anywhere else, but do not thrust yourself and your brutish stupidity and your fiendish tempers into the things of the house of God.  Let all parish ministers take for their text that day 2 Samuel vi. 6, 7:- And when they came to Nachon's threshing-floor, Uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of God, and took hold of it; for the oxen shook it.  And the anger of the Lord was kindled against Uzzah; and God smote him there for his error; and there he died by the ark of God.\\n\\n(3)  There is a third lesson here, but it is a lesson for ministers, and I shall take it home to myself.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXIV--A FAST-DAY IN MANSOUL\\n\\n'Sanctify a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the Lord your God.'-- Joel.\\n\\nIn our soft and self-indulgent day the very word 'to fast' has become an out-of-date and an obsolete word.  We never have occasion to employ that word in the living language of the present day.  The men of the next generation will need to have it explained to them what the Fast-days of their fathers were:  when they were instituted, how they were observed, and why they were abrogated and given up.  If your son should ever ask you just what the Fast-days of your youth were like, you will do him a great service, and he may live to recover them, if you will answer him in this way.  Show him how to take his Cruden and how to make a picture to his opening mind of the Fast-days of Scripture.  And tell him plainly for what things in fathers and in sons those fasts were ordained of God. And then for the Fast-days of the Puritan period let him read aloud to you this powerful passage in the Holy War.  Public preaching and public prayer entered largely into the fasting of the Prophetical and the Puritan periods; and John Bunyan, after Joel, has told us some things about the Fast-day preaching of his day that it will be well for us, both preachers and people, to begin with, and to lay well to heart.\\n\\n1. In the first place, the preaching of that Fast-day was 'pertinent' and to the point.  William Law, that divine writer for ministers, warns ministers against going off upon Euroclydon and the shipwrecks of Paul when Christ's sheep are looking up to them for their proper food.  What, he asks, is the nature, the direction, and the strength of that Mediterranean wind to him who has come up to church under the plague of his own heart and under the heavy hand of God?  You may be sure that Boanerges did not lecture that Fast-day forenoon in Mansoul on Acts xxvii. 14.  We would know that, even if we were not told what his text that forenoon was.  His text that never-to-be-forgotten Fast-day forenoon was in Luke xiii. 7--'Cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground?'  And a very smart sermon he made upon the place.  First, he showed what was the occasion of the words, namely, because the fig-tree was barren.  Then he showed what was contained in the sentence, to wit, repentance or utter desolation.  He then showed also by whose authority this sentence was pronounced.  And, lastly, he showed the reasons of the point, and then concluded his sermon. But he was very pertinent in the application, insomuch that he made all the elders and all their people in Mansoul to tremble.  Sidney Smith says that whatever else a sermon may be or may not be, it must be interesting if it is to do any good.  Now, pertinent preaching is always interesting preaching.  Nothing interests men like themselves.  And pertinent preaching is just preaching to men about themselves,--about their interests, their losses and their gains, their hopes and their fears, their trials and their tribulations.  Boanerges took both his text and his treatment of his text from his Master, and we know how pertinently The Master preached.  His preaching was with such pertinence that the one half of His hearers went home saying, Never man spake like this man, while the other half gnashed at Him with their teeth.  Our Lord never lectured on Euroclydon.  He knew what was in man and He lectured and preached accordingly.  And if we wish to have praise of our best people, and of Him whose people they are, let us look into our own hearts and preach.  That will be pertinent to our people which is first pertinent to ourselves.  Weep yourself, said an old poet to a new beginner; weep yourself if you would make me weep.  'For my own part,' said Thomas Shepard to some ministers from his deathbed, 'I never preached a sermon which, in the composing, did not cost me prayers, with strong cries and tears.  I never preached a sermon from which I had not first got some good to my own soul.'\\n\\n'His office and his name agree; A shepherd that and Shepard he.'\\n\\nAnd many such entries as these occur in Thomas Boston's golden journal:  'I preached in Ps. xlii. 5, and mostly on my own account.'  Again:  'Meditating my sermon next day, I found advantage to my own soul, as also in delivering it on the Sabbath.' And again:  'What good this preaching has done to others I know not, yet I think myself will not the worse of it.'\\n\\n1. The preaching of that Fast-day was with great authority also. 'There was such power and authority in that sermon,' reports one who was present, 'that the like had seldom been seen or heard.' Authority also was one of the well-remembered marks of our Lord's preaching.  And no wonder, considering who He was.  But His ministers, if they are indeed His ministers, will be clothed by Him with something even of His supreme authority.  'Conscience is an authority,' says one of the most authoritative preachers that ever lived.  'The Bible is an authority; such is the Church; such is antiquity; such are the words of the wise; such are hereditary lessons; such are ethical truths; such are historical memories; such are legal saws and state maxims; such are proverbs; such are sentiments, presages, and prepossessions.'  Now, the well-equipped preacher will from time to time plant his pulpit on all those kinds of authority, as this kind is now pertinent and then that, and will, with such a variety and accumulation of authority, preach to his people.  Thomas Boston preached at a certain place with such pertinence and with such authority that it was complained of him by one of themselves that he 'terrified even the godly.'  Let all our young preachers who would to old age continue to preach with interest, with pertinence, and with terrifying authority, among other things have by heart The Memoirs of Thomas Boston, 'that truly great divine.'\\n2. A third thing, and, as some of the people who heard it said of it, the best thing about that sermon was that--'He did not only show us our sin, but he did visibly tremble before us under the sense of his own.'  Now I know this to be a great difficulty with some young ministers who have got no help in it at the Divinity Hall.  Are they, they ask, to be themselves in the pulpit?  How far may they be themselves, and how far may they be not themselves? How far are they to be seen to tremble before their people because of their own sins, and how far are they to bear themselves as if they had no sin?  Must they keep back the passions that are tearing their own hearts, and fill the forenoon with Euroclydon and other suchlike sea-winds?  How far are they to be all gown and bands in the pulpit, and how far sackcloth and ashes?  One half of their people are like Pascal in this, that they like to see and hear a man in his pulpit; but, then, the other half like only to see and hear a proper preacher.  'He did not only show the men of Mansoul their sin, but he did tremble before them under the sense of his own.  Still crying out as he preached to them, Unhappy man that I am! that I should have done so wicked a thing!  That I, a preacher, should be one of the first in the transgression!'\\n\\nThis you will remember was the Fast-day.  And so truly had this preacher kept the Fast-day that the Communion-day was down upon him before he was ready for it.  He was still deep among his sins when all his people were fast putting on their beautiful garments.  He was ready with the letter of his action-sermon, but he was not equal to the delivery of it.  His colleague, accordingly, whose sense of sin was less acute that day, took the public worship, while the Fast-day preacher still lay sick in his closet at home and wrote thus on the ground:  'I am no more worthy to be called Thy son,' he wrote.  'Behold me here, Lord, a poor, miserable sinner, weary of myself, and afraid to look up to Thee.  Wilt Thou heal my sores?  Wilt Thou take out the stains?  Wilt Thou deliver me from the shame?  Wilt Thou rescue me from this chain of sin? Cut me not off in the midst of my sins.  Let me have liberty once again to be among Thy redeemed ones, eating and drinking at Thy table.  But, O my God, to-day I am an unclean worm, a dead dog, a dead carcass, deservedly cast out from the society of Thy saints. But oh, suffer me so much as to look to the place where Thy people meet and where Thine honour dwelleth.  Reject not the sacrifice of a broken heart, but come and speak to me in my secret place.  O God, let me never see such another day as this is.  Let me never be again so full of guilt as to have to run away from Thy presence and to flee from before Thy people.'  He printed more than that, in blood and in tears, before God that Communion-morning, but that is enough for my purpose.  Now, would you choose a dead dog like that to be your minister?  To baptize and admit your children and to marry them when they grow up?  To mount your pulpits every Sabbath- day, and to come to your houses every week-day?  Not, I feel sure, if you could help it!  Not if you knew it!  Not if there was a minister of proper pulpit manners and a well-ordered mind within a Sabbath-day's journey!  'Like priest like people,' says Hosea. 'The congregation and the minister are one,' says Dr. Parker. 'There are men we could not sit still and hear; they are not the proper ministers for us.  There are other men we could hear always, because they are our kith and our kin from before the foundation of the world.'  Happy the hearer who has hit on a minister like the minister of Mansoul, and who has discovered in him his everlasting kith and kin.  And happy the minister who, owning kith and kin with Boanerges, has two or three or even one member in his congregation who likes his minister best when he likes himself worst.\\n\\nBut what about the fasting all this time?  Was it all preaching, and was there no fasting?  Well, we do not know much about the fasting of the prophets and the apostles, but the Puritans sometimes made their people almost forget about fasting, and about eating and drinking too, they so took possession of their people with their incomparable preaching.  I read, for instance, in Calamy's Life of John Howe that on the public Fast-days, it was Howe's common way to begin about nine in the morning and to continue reading, preaching, and praying till about four in the afternoon.  Henry Rogers almost worships John Howe, but John Howe's Fast-days pass his modern biographers patience; till, if you would see a nineteenth-century case made out against a seventeenth- century Fast-day, you have only to turn to the author of The Eclipse of Faith on the author of Delighting in God.  And, no doubt, when we get back our Fast-days, we shall leave more of the time to reading pertinent books at home and to secret fasting and to secret prayer, and shall enjoin our preachers, while they are pertinent and authoritative in their sermons, not to take up the whole day with their sermons even at their best.  And then, as to fasting, discredited and discarded as it is in our day, there are yet some very good reasons for desiring its return and reinstatement among us.  Very good reasons, both for health and for holiness.  But it is only of the latter class of reasons that I would fain for a few words at present speak.  Well, then, let it be frankly said that there is nothing holy, nothing saintly, nothing at all meritorious in fasting from our proper food.  It is the motive alone that sanctifies the means.  It is the end alone that sanctifies the exercise.  If I fast to chastise myself for my sin; if I fast to reduce the fuel of my sin; if I fast to keep my flesh low; if I fast to make me more free for my best books, for my most inward, spiritual, mystical books--for my Kempis, and my Behmen, and my Law, and my Leighton, and my Goodwin, and my Bunyan, and my Rutherford, and my Jeremy Taylor, and my Shepard, and my Edwards, and suchlike; if I fast for the ends of meditation and prayer; if I fast out of sympathy with my Bible, and my Saviour, and my latter end, and my Father's house in heaven--then, no doubt, my fasting will be acceptable with God, as it will certainly be an immediate means of grace to my sinful soul.  These altars will sanctify many such gifts.  For, who that knows anything at all about himself, about his own soul, and about the hindrances and helps to its salvation from sin; who that ever read a page of Scripture properly, or spent half an hour in that life which is hidden in God--who of such will deny or doubt that fasting is superseded or neglected to the sure loss of the spiritual life, to the sensible lowering of the religious tone and temper, and to the increase both of the lusts of the flesh and of the mind?  It may perhaps be that the institution of fasting as a church ordinance has been permitted to be set aside in order to make it more than ever a part of each earnest man's own private life.  Perhaps it was in some ways full time that it should be again said to us, 'Thou, when thou fastest, appear not unto men to fast.'  As also, 'Is not this the fast that I have chosen:  to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?  Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the outcast to thy house?'  Let us believe that the form of the Fast-day has been removed out of the way that the spirit may return and fashion a new form for itself.  And in the belief that that is so, let us, while parting with our fathers' Fast-days with real regret--as with their pertinent and pungent preaching--let us meantime lay in a stock of their pertinent and pungent books, and set apart particular and peculiar seasons for their sin-subduing and grace-strengthening study.\\n\\nThe short is this.  The one real substance and true essence of all fasting is self-denial.  And we can never get past either the supreme and absolute duty of that, or the daily and hourly call to that, as long as we continue to read the New Testament, to live in this life, and to listen to the voice of conscience, and to the voice of God speaking to us in the voice of conscience.  Without strict and constant self-denial, no man, whatever his experiences or his pretensions, is a disciple of Jesus Christ, and secret fasting is one of the first, the easiest, and the most elementary exercises of New Testament self-denial.  And, besides, the lusts of our flesh and the lusts of our minds are so linked and locked and riveted together that if one link is loosened, or broken, or even struck at, the whole thrall is not yet thrown off indeed, but it is all shaken; it has all received a staggering blow.  So much is this the case that one single act of self-denial in the region of the body will be felt for freedom throughout the whole prison-house of the soul.  And a victory really won over a sensual sin is already a challenge sounded to our most spiritual sin.  And it is this discovery that has given to fasting the place it has held in all the original, resolute, and aggressive ages of the Church.  With little or nothing in their Lord's literal teaching to make His people fast, they have been so bent on their own spiritual deliverance, and they have heard and read so much about the deliverances both of body and of soul that have been attained by fasting and its accompaniments, that they have taken to it in their despair, and with results that have filled them in some instances with rapture, and in all instances with a good conscience and with a good hope.  You would wonder, even in these degenerate days,--you would be amazed could you be told how many of your own best friends in their stealthy, smiling, head-anointing, hypocritical way deny themselves this and that sweetness, this and that fatness, this and that softness, and are thus attaining to a strength, a courage, and a self-conquest that you are getting the benefit of in many ways without your ever guessing the price at which it has all been purchased.  Now, would you yourself fain be found among those who are in this way being made strong and victorious inwardly and spiritually?  Would you?  Then wash your face and anoint your head; and, then, not denying it before others, deny it in secret to yourself--this and that sweet morsel, this and that sweet meat, this and that glass of such divine wine.  Unostentatiously, ungrudgingly, generous-heartedly, and not ascetically or morosely, day after day deny yourself even in little unthought-of things, and one of the very noblest laws of your noblest life shall immediately claim you as its own.  That stealthy and shamefaced act of self- denial for Christ's sake and for His cross's sake will lay the foundation of a habit of self-denial; ere ever you are aware of what you are doing the habit will consolidate into a character; and what you begin little by little in the body will be made perfect in the soul; till what you did, almost against His command and altogether without His example, yet because you did it for His sake and in His service, will have placed you far up among those who have forsaken all, and themselves also, to follow Jesus Christ, Son of Man and Son of God.  Only, let this always be admitted, and never for a moment forgotten, that all this is said by permission and not of commandment.  Our Lord never fasted as we fast.  He had no need.  And He never commanded His disciples to fast.  He left it to themselves to find out each man his own case and his own cure. Let no man, therefore, take fasting in any of its degrees, or times, or occasions, on his conscience who does not first find it in his heart.  At the same time this may be said with perfect safety, that he who finds it in his heart and then lays it on his conscience to deny himself anything, great or small, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of his own salvation,--he will never repent it.  No, he will never repent it.\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV--A FEAST-DAY IN MANSOUL\\n\\n'He brought me into his banqueting house.'--The Song.\\n\\nEmmanuel's feast-day in the Holy War excels in beauty and in eloquence everything I know in any other author on the Lord's Supper.  The Song of Solomon stands alone when we sing that song mystically--that is to say, when we pour into it all the love of God to His Church in Israel and all Israel's love to God, and then all our Lord's love to us and all our love back again to Him in return.  But outside of Holy Scripture I know nothing to compare for beauty, and for sweetness, and for quaintness, and for tenderness, and for rapture, with John Bunyan's account of the feast that Prince Emmanuel made for the town of Mansoul.  With his very best pen John Bunyan tells us how upon a time Emmanuel made a feast in Mansoul, and how the townsfolk came to the castle to partake of His banquet, and how He feasted them on all manner of outlandish food--food that grew not in the fields of Mansoul; it was food that came down from heaven and from His Father's house. They drank also of the water that was made wine, and, altogether, they were very merry and at home with their Prince.  There was music also all the time at the table, and man did eat angels' food, and had honey given him out of the rock.  And then the table was entertained with some curious and delightful riddles that were made upon the King Himself, upon Emmanuel His Son, and upon His wars and doings with Mansoul; till, altogether, the state of transportation the people were in with their entertainment cannot be told by the very best of pens.  Nor did He, when they returned to their places, send them empty away; for either they must have a ring, or a gold chain, or a bracelet, or a white stone or something; so dear was Mansoul to Him now, so lovely was Mansoul in His eyes.  And, going and coming to the feast, O how graciously, how lovingly, how courteously, and how tenderly did this blessed Prince now carry it to the town of Mansoul!  In all the streets, gardens, orchards, and other places where He came, to be sure the poor should have His blessing and benediction; yea, He would kiss them; and if they were ill, He would lay His hands on them and make them well.  And was it not now something amazing to behold that in that very place where Diabolus had had his abode, the Prince of princes should now sit eating and drinking with all His mighty captains, and men of war, and trumpeters, and with the singing men and the singing women of His Father's court!  Now did Mansoul's cup run over; now did her conduits run sweet wine; now did she eat the finest of the wheat, and now drink milk and honey out of the rock!  Now she said, How great is His goodness, for ever since I found favour in His eyes, how honourable have I ever been!\\n\\n1. Now, the beginning of it all was, and the best of it all was, that Emmanuel Himself made the feast.  Mansoul did not feast her Deliverer; it was her Deliverer who feasted her.  Mansoul, in good sooth, had nothing that she had not first and last received, and it was far more true and seemly and fit in every way that her Prince Himself should in His own way and at His own expense seal and celebrate the deliverance, the freedom, the life, the peace, and the joy of Mansoul.  And, besides, what had Mansoul to set before her Prince; or, for the matter of that, before herself?  Mansoul had nothing of herself.  Mansoul was not sufficient of herself for a single day.  And how, then, should she propose to feast a Prince? No, no! the thing was impossible.  It was Emmanuel's feast from first to last.  Just as it was at the Lord's table in this house this morning.  You did not spread the table this morning for your Lord.  You did not make ready for your Saviour and then invite Him in.  He invited you.  He said, This is My Body broken for you, and This is My Blood shed for you; drink ye all of it.  And had any one challenged you at the fence door and asked you how one who could not pay his own debts or provide himself a proper meal even for a single day, could dare to sit down with such a company at such a feast as that, you would have told him that he had not seen half your hunger and your nakedness; but that it was just your very hunger and nakedness and homelessness that had brought you here; or, rather, it was all that that had moved the Master of the feast to send for you and to compel you to come here.  There was nothing in your mind and in your mouth more all this day than just that this is the Lord's Supper, and that He had sent for you and had invited you, and had constrained and compelled you to come and partake of it.  It was the Lord's Table to-day, and it will be still and still more His table on that great Communion-Day when all our earthly communions shall be accomplished and consummated in heaven.\\n2. All that Mansoul did in connection with that great feast was to prepare the place where Diabolus at one time had held his orgies and carried on his excesses.  Her Prince, Emmanuel, did all the rest; but He left it to Mansoul to make the banqueting-room ready. When our Lord would keep His last passover with His disciples, He said to Peter and John, Go into the city, and there shall meet you a man bearing a pitcher of water, and he will show you a large upper room furnished and prepared.  There is some reason to believe that that happy man had been expecting that message and had done his best to be ready for it.  And now he was putting the last touch to his preparations by filling the water-pots of his house with fresh water; little thinking, happy man, that as long as the world lasts that water will be holy water in all men's eyes, and shall teach humility to all men's hearts.  And, my brethren, you know that all you did all last week against to-day was just to prepare the room.  For the room all last week and all this day was your own heart, and not and never this house of stone and lime made with men's hands.  You swept the inner and upper room of your own heart. You swept it and garnished its walls and its floors as much as in you lay.  He, whose the supper really was, told you that He would bring with Him what was to be eaten and drunken to-day, while you were to prepare the place.  And, next to the very actual feast itself, and, sometimes, not next to it but equal to it, and even before it and better than it, were those busy household hours you spent, like the man with the pitcher, making the room ready.  In plain English, you had a communion before the Communion as you prepared your hearts for the Communion.  I shall not intrude into your secret places and secret seasons with Christ before His open reception of you to-day.  But it is sure and certain that, just as you in secret entertained Him in your mother's house and in the chambers of her that bare you, just in that measure did He say to you openly before all the watchmen that go about the city and before all the daughters of Jerusalem, Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.  Yes; do you not think that the man with the pitcher had his reward?  He had his own thoughts as he furnished, till it was quite ready, his best upper room and carried in those pitchers of water, and handed down to his children in after days the perquisite-skin of the paschal lamb that had been supped on by our Lord and His disciples in his honoured house that night.  Yes; was it not amazing to behold that in that very place where sometimes Diabolus had his abode, and had entertained his Diabolonians, the Prince of princes should sit eating and drinking with His friends?  Was it not truly amazing?\\n3. Now, upon the feasting-day He feasted them with all manner of outlandish food--food that grew not in all the fields of Mansoul; it was food that came down with His Father's court.  The fields of Mansoul yielded their own proper fruits, and fruits that were not to be despised.  But they were not the proper fruits for that day, neither could they be placed upon that table.  They are good enough fruits for their purpose, and as far as they go, and for so long as they last and are in their season.  But our souls are such that they outlive their own best fruits; their hunger and their thirst outlast all that can be harvested in from their own fields.  And thus it is that He who made Mansoul at first, and who has since redeemed her, has out of His own great goodness provided food convenient for her.  He knows with what an outlandish life He has quickened Mansoul, and it is only the part of a faithful Creator to provide for His creature her proper nourishment.  What is it? asked the children of Israel at one another when they saw a small round thing, as small as hoarfrost, upon the ground.  For they wist not what it was.  And Moses said, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons.  And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna, and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.  He gave them of the corn of heaven to eat, and man did eat in the wilderness angels' food.  Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead; but this is the bread of which if any man eat he shall not die.  And the bread that I will give is My Flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.  And so outlandish, so supernatural, and so full of heavenly wonder and heavenly mystery was that bread, that the Jews strove among themselves over it, and could not understand it.  But, by His goodness and His truth to us this day, we have again, to our spiritual nourishment and growth in grace, eaten the Flesh and drunk the Blood of the Son of God; a meat that, as He who Himself is that meat has said of it, is meat indeed and drink indeed--as, indeed, we have the witness in ourselves this day that it is.  They drank also of the water that was made wine, and were very merry with Him all that day at His table.  And all their mirth was the high mirth of heaven; it was a mirth and a gladness without sin, without satiety, and without remorse.\\n4. There was music also all the while at the table, and the musicians were not those of the country of Mansoul, but they were the masters of song come down from the court of the King.  'I love the Lord,' they sang in the supper room over the paschal lamb--'I love the Lord because He hath heard my voice and my supplication. Because He hath inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live.  What shall I render to the Lord,' they challenged one another, 'for all His benefits towards me?  I will take the cup of salvation, and will call upon the name of the Lord.'  'Sometimes imagine,' says a great devotional writer with a great imagination--'Sometimes imagine that you had been one of those that joined with our blessed Saviour as He sang an hymn. Strive to imagine to yourself with what majesty He looked.  Fancy that you had stood by Him surrounded with His glory.  Think how your heart would have been inflamed, and what ecstasies of joy you would have then felt when singing with the Son of God!  Think again and again with what joy and devotion you would have then sung had this really been your happy state; and what a punishment you would have thought it to have then been silent.  And let that teach you how to be affected with psalms and hymns of thanksgiving.'  Yes; and it is no imagination; it was our own experience only this morning and afternoon to join in a music that was never made in this world, but which was as outlandish as was the meat which we ate while the music was being made.\\n\\n'Bless, O my soul, the Lord thy God, And not forgetful be Of all His gracious benefits He hath bestow'd on thee.\\n\\nWho with abundance of good things Doth satisfy thy mouth; So that, ev'n as the eagle's age, Renewed is thy youth.'\\n\\nThe 103rd Psalm was never made in this world.  Musicians far other than those native to Mansoul made for us our Lord's-Table Psalm.\",\"timestamp\":1641298111,\"title\":\"Now, I will not enter to-night on the abstract benefits of such an Establishment\"},\"digest\":\"YUvk0_5xC7Rjq7dF-rCqB-jspw-nz-JBJD6QwxSiSlE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6961235d2e95818F7a1E230634bC24de80Bd6f6a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hKxRptIl-v_ez8hPhblTWGqCWe8X7DzwlP6hPjn0ON0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wmLzs0bC98iBxjjTpIilQsLFFY7bYM9-CylqRpurEpg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"43wLKagXdRuSuG54QR6puYsLXonMY8cwR69o1kf932opXqJ3LLNOdYuOzbqrf5bjeAGT8E1rqEK0zgW2L_NMMw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc0599511c1b6b028c112802bd42e2063d83c94add0a8f4ca8b7e15bf06b9ecc14cccc4f390dd4d0573e741cf10cfa8b390af0d450e95917f2350d8d723b7b98b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hKxRptIl-v_ez8hPhblTWGqCWe8X7DzwlP6hPjn0ON0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wmLzs0bC98iBxjjTpIilQsLFFY7bYM9-CylqRpurEpg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YUvk0_5xC7Rjq7dF-rCqB-jspw-nz-JBJD6QwxSiSlE\"}"
