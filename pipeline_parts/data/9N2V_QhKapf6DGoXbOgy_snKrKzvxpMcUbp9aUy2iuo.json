Artworks that explore deep time are often concerned with planetary processes and the nature of the cosmos. For our first exhibition, we want to exhibit art that engages with this concept from a future-facing perspective, combining the digital and the primordial, the prehistoric and the post-human. We would also like to display works that incorporate duration in innovative ways.\\n\\nArtwork subject matter might include:\\n\\n- Landscape and geology\\n- Cosmic phenomena\\n- Primordial matter\\n- Ancient systems of knowledge\\n- Elemental forces (fire/water/wind)\\n- Crystals and fractal structures\\n- Ecology and the Anthropocene\\n- Slowness and drift\\n- Decay\\n\\n**[Submit your artworks here](https://4nxi7fajod3.typeform.com/to/oRPApFup)**\\n\\nIf you have any questions, please ask them on our Discord server [here](https://discord.gg/dna65t9rNP). \\n\\nWe're excited to review your submissions and unveil the show!\\n\\nThe artwork pictured in the exhibition cover image is[ Series 3: Entropy - Token 144 by DEAFBEEF](https://opensea.io/assets/0xd754937672300ae6708a51229112de4017810934/144)\",\"timestamp\":1623859801,\"title\":\"Open Call - Deep Time \",\"publication\":\"jpg\"},\"digest\":\"Zap6oLNvWtSH9DKZBU9s6q0XZXV8RAbn31T-cQDfmmc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC4f287b062A3D391bb8FF86aCE1fe337F0512b23\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z7m0xFw_BBJsp-aT4H46bTMcbny59TWAR0ID3V7Rq-U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BuLB0EO5vv5QJwy5I-BLWaPsM1DykTsctQ3A0ArRzqk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PYHZv2CKhRiihnrTtvZ6ejdHV7YBgmIod-WhdnyuW5VW3Obda-I5xU0Qdxyv5oiNo_2zIb7bfzZ0SXOufOCkxg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc4e10f6f42a452684dc9df02c79f3939b3361788c6b96538821774726fd2075960d42a497f611fbc461061f35bccb5ad85db6f7d9b3524e32cbd5174be38a91d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jpg.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Z7m0xFw_BBJsp-aT4H46bTMcbny59TWAR0ID3V7Rq-U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BuLB0EO5vv5QJwy5I-BLWaPsM1DykTsctQ3A0ArRzqk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3nvOxrYY-2DaXRqw14sUFSwyLGEZGflqoaD5xxfdGv0\"}"
