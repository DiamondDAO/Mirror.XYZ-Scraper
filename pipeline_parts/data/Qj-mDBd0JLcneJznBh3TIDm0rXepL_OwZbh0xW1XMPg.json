"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Ali had long cherished a violent passion for Zobeide, the wife of his son Veli Pacha: Having vainly attempted to gratify it after his son's departure, and being indignantly repulsed, he had recourse to drugs, and the unhappy Zobeide remained in ignorance of her misfortune until she found she was pregnant.  Then, half-avowals from her women, compelled to obey the pacha from fear of death, mixed with confused memories of her own, revealed the whole terrible truth.  Not knowing in her despair which way to turn, she wrote to Ali, entreating him to visit the harem.  As head of the family, he had a right to enter, being supposed responsible for the conduct of his sons' families, no- law-giver having hitherto contemplated the possibility of so disgraceful a crime.  When he appeared, Zobeide flung herself at his feet, speechless with grief.  Ali acknowledged his guilt, pleaded the violence of his passion, wept with his victim, and entreating her to control herself and keep silence, promised that all should be made right. Neither the prayers nor tears of Zobeide could induce him to give up the intention of effacing the traces of his first crime by a second even more horrible.\\n\\nBut the story was already whispered abroad, and Pacho Bey learnt all its details from the spies he kept in Janina.  Delighted at the prospect of avenging himself on the father, he hastened with his news to the son.  Veli Pacha, furious, vowed vengeance, and demanded Pacho Bey's help, which was readily promised.  But Ali had been warned, and was not a man to be taken unawares.  Pacho Bey, whom Veli had just promoted to the office of sword-bearer, was attacked in broad daylight by six emissaries sent from Janina.  He obtained timely help, however, and five of the assassins, taken red-handed, were at once hung without ceremony in the market-place.  The sixth was the messenger whose arrival with the news had caused such dismay at Ali's banquet.\\n\\nAs Ali reflected how the storm he had raised could best be laid, he was informed that the ruler of the marriage feast sent by Moustai, Pacha of Scodra, to receive the young bride who should reign in his harem, had just arrived in the plain of Janina.  He was Yussuf Bey of the Delres, an old enemy of Ali's, and had encamped with his escort of eight hundred warriors at the foot of Tomoros of Dodona.  Dreading some treachery, he absolutely refused all entreaties to enter the town, and Ali seeing that it was useless to insist, and that his adversary for the present was safe, at once sent his grand-daughter, the Princess of Aulis, out to him.\\n\\nThis matter disposed of, Ali was able to attend to his hideous family tragedy.  He began by effecting the disappearance of the women whom he had been compelled to make his accomplices; they were simply sewn up in sacks by gipsies and thrown into the lake.  This done, he himself led the executioners into a subterranean part of the castle, where they were beheaded by black mutes as a reward for their obedience.  He then sent a doctor to Zobeide; who succeeded in causing a miscarriage, and who, his work done, was seized and strangled by the black mutes who had just beheaded the gipsies. Having thus got rid of all who could bear witness to his crime, he wrote to Veli that he might now send for his wife and two of his children, hitherto detained as hostages, and that the innocence of Zobeide would confound a calumniator who had dared to assail him with such injurious suspicions.\\n\\nWhen this letter arrived, Pacho Bey, distrusting equally the treachery of the father and the weakness of the son, and content with having sown the seeds of dissension in his enemy's family, had sufficient wisdom to seek safety in flight.  Ali, furious, vowed, on hearing this, that his vengeance should overtake him even at the ends of the earth.  Meanwhile he fell back on Yussuf Bey of the Debres, whose escape when lately at Janina still rankled in his mind.  As Yussuf was dangerous both from character and influence, Ali feared to attack him openly, and sought to assassinate him.  This was not precisely easy; for, exposed to a thousand dangers of this kind, the nobles of that day were on their guard.  Steel and poison were used up, and another way had to be sought.  Ali found it.\\n\\nOne of the many adventurers with whom Janina was filled penetrated to the pacha's presence, and offered to sell the secret of a powder whereof three grains would suffice to kill a man with a terrible explosion--explosive powder, in short.  Ali heard with delight, but replied that he must see it in action before purchasing.\\n\\nIn the dungeons of the castle by the lake, a poor monk of the order of St. Basil was slowly dying, for having boldly refused a sacrilegious simony proposed to him by Ali.  He was a fit subject for the experiment, and was successfully blown to pieces, to the great satisfaction of Ali, who concluded his bargain, and hastened to make use of it.  He prepared a false firman, which, according to custom, was enclosed and sealed in a cylindrical case, and sent to Yussuf Bey by a Greek, wholly ignorant of the real object of his mission. Opening it without suspicion, Yussuf had his arm blown off, and died in consequence, but found time to despatch a message to Moustai Pacha of Scodra, informing him of the catastrophe, and warning him to keep good guard.\\n\\nYussuf's letter was received by Moustai just as a similar infernal machine was placed in his hands under cover to his young wife.  The packet was seized, and a careful examination disclosed its nature. The mother of Moustai, a jealous and cruel woman, accused her daughter-in-law of complicity, and the unfortunate Ayesha, though shortly to become a mother, expired in agony from the effects of poison, only guilty of being the innocent instrument of her grandfather's treachery.\\n\\nFortune having frustrated Ali's schemes concerning Moustai Pacha, offered him as consolation a chance of invading the territory of Parga, the only place in Epirus which had hitherto escaped his rule, and which he greedily coveted.  Agia, a small Christian town on the coast, had rebelled against him and allied itself to Parga.  It provided an excuse for hostilities, and Ali's troops, under his son Mouktar, first seized Agia, where they only found a few old men to massacre, and then marched on Parga, where the rebels had taken refuge.  After a few skirmishes, Mouktar entered the town, and though the Parganiotes fought bravely, they must inevitably have surrendered had they been left to themselves.  But they had sought protection from the French, who had garrisoned the citadel, and the French grenadiers descending rapidly from the height, charged the Turks with so much fury that they fled in all directions, leaving on the field four \\\"bimbashis,\\\" or captains of a thousand, and a considerable number of killed and wounded.\\n\\nThe pacha's fleet succeeded no better than his army.  Issuing from the Gulf of Ambracia, it was intended to attack Parga from the sea, joining in the massacre, and cutting off all hope of escape from that side, Ali meaning to spare neither the garrison nor any male inhabitants over twelve years of age.  But a few shots fired from a small fort dispersed the ships, and a barque manned by sailors from Paxos pursued them, a shot from which killed Ali's admiral on his quarter-deck.  He was a Greek of Galaxidi, Athanasius Macrys by name.\\n\\nFilled with anxiety, Ali awaited news at Prevesa, where a courier, sent off at the beginning of the action, had brought him oranges gathered in the orchards of Parga.  Ali gave him a purse of gold, and publicly proclaimed his success.  His joy was redoubled when a second messenger presented two heads of French soldiers, and announced that his troops were in possession of the lower part of Parga.  Without further delay he ordered his attendants to mount, entered his carriage, and started triumphantly on the Roman road to Nicopolis. He sent messengers to his generals, ordering them to spare the women and children of Parga, intended for his harem, and above all to take strict charge of the plunder.  He was approaching the arena of Nicopolis when a third Tartar messenger informed him of the defeat of his army.  Ali changed countenance, and could scarcely articulate the order to return to Prevesa.  Once in his palace, he gave way to such fury that all around him trembled, demanding frequently if it could be true that his troops were beaten.  \\\"May your misfortune be upon us!\\\" his attendants answered, prostrating themselves.  All at once, looking out on the calm blue sea which lay before his windows, he perceived his fleet doubling Cape Pancrator and re-entering the Ambracian Gulf under full sail; it anchored close by the palace, and on hailing the leading ship a speaking trumpet announced to Ali the death of his admiral, Athanasius Macrys.\\n\\n\\\"But Parga, Parga!\\\" cried Ali.\\n\\n\\\"May Allah grant the pacha long life!  The Parganiotes have escaped the sword of His Highness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is the will of Allah!\\\" murmured the pacha; whose head sank upon his breast in dejection.\\n\\nArms having failed, Ali, as usual, took refuge in plots and treachery, but this time, instead of corrupting his enemies with gold, he sought to weaken them by division.\\n\\nCHAPTER VII\\n\\nThe French commander Nicole, surnamed the \\\"Pilgrim,\\\" on account of a journey he had once made to Mecca, had spent six months at Janina with a brigade of artillery which General Marmont, then commanding in the Illyrian provinces, had for a time placed at Ali's disposal.  The old officer had acquired the esteem and friendship of the pacha, whose leisure he had often amused by stories of his campaigns and various adventures, and although it was now long since they had met, he still had the reputation of being Ali's friend.  Ali prepared his plans accordingly.  He wrote a letter to Colonel Nicole, apparently in continuation of a regular correspondence between them, in which he thanked the colonel for his continued affection, and besought him by various powerful motives to surrender Parga, of which he promised him the governorship during the rest of his life.  He took good care to complete his treason by allowing the letter to fall into the hands of the chief ecclesiastics of Parga, who fell head-foremost into the trap.  Seeing that the tone of the letter was in perfect accordance with the former friendly relations between their French governor and the pacha, they were convinced of the former's treachery.  But the result was not as Ali had hoped: the Parganiotes resumed their former negotiations with the English, preferring to place their freedom in the hands of a Christian nation rather than to fall under the rule of a Mohammedan satrap....  The English immediately sent a messenger to Colonel Nicole, offering honourable conditions of capitulation.  The colonel returned a decided refusal, and threatened to blow up the place if the inhabitants, whose intentions he guessed, made the slightest hostile movement.  However, a few days later, the citadel was taken at night, owing to the treachery of a woman who admitted an English detachment; and the next day, to the general astonishment, the British standard floated over the Acropolis of Parga.\\n\\nAll Greece was then profoundly stirred by a faint gleam of the dawn of liberty, and shaken by a suppressed agitation.  The Bourbons again reigned in France, and the Greeks built a thousand hopes on an event which changed the basis of the whole European policy.  Above all, they reckoned on powerful assistance from Russia.  But England had already begun to dread anything which could increase either the possessions or the influence of this formidable power.  Above all, she was determined that the Ottoman Empire should remain intact, and that the Greek navy, beginning to be formidable, must be destroyed. With these objects in view, negotiations with Ali Pacha were resumed. The latter was still smarting under his recent disappointment, and to all overtures answered only, \\\"Parga!  I must have Parga.\\\"--And the English were compelled to yield it!\\n\\nTrusting to the word of General Campbell, who had formally promised, on its surrender, that Parga should be classed along with the seven Ionian Isles; its grateful inhabitants were enjoying a delicious rest after the storm, when a letter from the Lord High Commissioner, addressed to Lieutenant-Colonel de Bosset, undeceived them, and gave warning of the evils which were to burst on the unhappy town.\\n\\nOn the 25th of March, 1817, notwithstanding the solemn promise made to the Parganiotes, when they admitted the British troops, that they should always be on the same footing as the Ionian Isles, a treaty was signed at Constantinople by the British Plenipotentiary, which stipulated the complete and stipulated cession of Parga and all its territory to, the Ottoman Empire.  Soon there arrived at Janine Sir John Cartwright, the English Consul at Patras, to arrange for the sale of the lands of the Parganiotes and discuss the conditions of their emigration.  Never before had any such compact disgraced European diplomacy, accustomed hitherto to regard Turkish encroachments as simple sacrilege.  But Ali Pacha fascinated the English agents, overwhelming them with favours, honours, and feasts, carefully watching them all the while.  Their correspondence was intercepted, and he endeavoured by means of his agents to rouse the Parganiotes against them.  The latter lamented bitterly, and appealed to Christian Europe, which remained deaf to their cries.  In the name of their ancestors, they demanded the rights which had been guaranteed them.  \\\"They will buy our lands,\\\" they said; \\\"have we asked to sell them?  And even if we received their value, can gold give us a country and the tombs of our ancestors?\\\"\\n\\nAli Pacha invited the Lord High Commissioner of Great Britain, Sir Thomas Maitland, to a conference at Prevesa, and complained of the exorbitant price of 1,500,000, at which the commissioners had estimated Parga and its territory, including private property and church furniture.  It had been hoped that Ali's avarice would hesitate at this high price, but he was not so easily discouraged. He give a banquet for the Lord High Commissioner, which degenerated into a shameless orgy.  In the midst of this drunken hilarity the Turk and the Englishman disposed of the territory of Parga; agreeing that a fresh estimate should be made on the spot by experts chosen by both English and Turks.  The result of this valuation was that the indemnity granted to the Christians was reduced by the English to the sum of 276,075 sterling, instead of the original 500,000.  And as Ali's agents only arrived at the sum of 56,750, a final conference was held at Buthrotum between Ali and the Lord High Commissioner. The latter then informed the Parganiotes that the indemnity allowed them was irrevocably fixed at 150,000!  The transaction is a disgrace to the egotistical and venal nation which thus allowed the life and liberty of a people to be trifled with, a lasting blot on the honour of England!\\n\\nThe Parganiotes at first could believe neither in the infamy of their protectors nor in their own misfortune; but both were soon confirmed by a proclamation of the Lord High Commissioner, informing them that the pacha's army was marching to take possession of the territory which, by May 10th, must be abandoned for ever.\\n\\nThe fields were then in full bearing.  In the midst of plains ripening for a rich harvest were 80,000 square feet of olive trees, alone estimated at two hundred thousand guineas.  The sun shone in cloudless azure, the air was balmy with the scent of orange trees, of pomegranates and citrons.  But the lovely country might have been inhabited by phantoms; only hands raised to heaven and brows bent to the dust met one's eye.  Even the very dust belonged no more to the wretched inhabitants; they were forbidden to take a fruit or a flower, the priests might not remove either relics or sacred images. Church, ornaments, torches, tapers, pyxes, had by this treaty all become Mahommedan property.  The English had sold everything, even to the Host!  Two days more, and all must be left.  Each was silently marking the door of the dwelling destined so soon to shelter an enemy, with a red cross, when suddenly a terrible cry echoed from street to street, for the Turks had been perceived on the heights overlooking the town.  Terrified and despairing, the whole population hastened to fall prostrate before the Virgin of Parga, the ancient guardian of their citadel.  A mysterious voice, proceeding from the sanctuary, reminded them that the English had, in their iniquitous treaty, forgotten to include the ashes of those whom a happier fate had spared the sight of the ruin of Parga.  Instantly they rushed to the graveyards, tore open the tombs, and collected the bones and putrefying corpses.  The beautiful olive trees were felled, an enormous funeral pyre arose, and in the general excitement the orders of the English chief were defied.  With naked daggers in their hands, standing in the crimson light of the flames which were consuming the bones of their ancestors, the people of Parga vowed to slay their wives and children, and to kill themselves to the last man, if the infidels dared to set foot in the town before the appointed hour. Xenocles, the last of the Greek poets, inspired by this sublime manifestation of despair, even as Jeremiah by the fall of Jerusalem, improvised a hymn which expresses all the grief of the exiles, and which the exiles interrupted by their tears and sobs.\\n\\nA messenger, crossing the sea in all haste, informed the Lord High Commissioner of the terrible threat of the Parganiotes.  He started at once, accompanied by General Sir Frederic Adams, and landed at Parga by the light of the funeral pyre.  He was received with ill-concealed indignation, and with assurances that the sacrifice would be at once consummated unless Ali's troops were held back.  The general endeavoured to console and to reassure the unhappy people, and then proceeded to the outposts, traversing silent streets in which armed men stood at each door only waiting a signal before slaying their families, and then turning their weapons against the English and themselves.  He implored them to have patience, and they answered by pointing to the approaching Turkish army and bidding him hasten.  He arrived at last and commenced negotiations, and the Turkish officers, no less uneasy than the English garrison, promised to wait till the appointed hour.  The next day passed in mournful silence, quiet as death, At sunset on the following day, May 9, 1819, the English standard on the castle of Parga was hauled down, and after a night spent in prayer and weeping, the Christians demanded the signal of departure.\\n\\nThey had left their dwellings at break of day, and scattering on the shore, endeavoured to collect some relics of their country.  Some filled little bags with ashes withdrawn from the funeral pile; others took handfuls of earth, while the women and children picked up pebbles which they hid in their clothing and pressed to their bosoms, as if fearing to be deprived of them.  Meanwhile, the ships intended to transport them arrived, and armed English soldiers superintended the embarkation, which the Turks hailed from afar with, ferocious cries.  The Parganiotes were landed in Corfu, where they suffered yet more injustice.  Under various pretexts the money promised them was reduced and withheld, until destitution compelled them to accept the little that was offered.  Thus closed one of the most odious transactions which modern history has been compelled to record.\\n\\nThe satrap of Janina had arrived at the fulfilment of his wishes.  In the retirement of his fairy-like palace by the lake he could enjoy voluptuous pleasures to the full.  But already seventy-eight years had passed over his head, and old age had laid the burden of infirmity upon him.  His dreams were dreams of blood, and vainly he sought refuge in chambers glittering with gold, adorned with arabesques, decorated with costly armour and covered with the richest of Oriental carpets, remorse stood ever beside him.  Through the magnificence which surrounded him there constantly passed the gale spectre of Emineh, leading onwards a vast procession of mournful phantoms, and the guilty pasha buried his face in his hands and shrieked aloud for help.  Sometimes, ashamed of his weakness, he endeavoured to defy both the reproaches of his conscience and the opinion of the multitude, and sought to encounter criticism with bravado.  If, by chance, he overheard some blind singer chanting in the streets the satirical verses which, faithful to the poetical and mocking genius of them ancestors, the Greeks frequently composed about him, he would order the singer to be brought, would bid him repeat his verses, and, applauding him, would relate some fresh anecdote of cruelty, saying, \\\"Go, add that to thy tale; let thy hearers know what I can do; let them understand that I stop at nothing in order to overcome my foes!  If I reproach myself with anything, it is only with the deeds I have sometimes failed to carry out.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639209045,\"title\":\"Now for the subject of the message, and the cause of the dismay it produced.\"},\"digest\":\"RC-4OYX0VN1FGegd3gcPg6Z7LXPaZklTu8Zj6VXBMQ8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6e15513EBD81b8159946378511dF1E78276e74F2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zfRybHT64nUaTmDDnx0LOY-39LxxbgxWdZoEmrpiAak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w-t7ytBYbxvvJEB4uKCpT6Q3RcORIRV9_PmG4K798pI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"f6zKvXZ9xLt001QUEJM0cbpFxaPXAhk1f0PXeN2AHGsLIpsBGbawER1ETnH68OWiLoOb1xXnlmyyij7jkpZGwQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf0ff6bbb169b3954706e1326147999143e1ed8fde71a5a7f9443dc1a2e82d4ff0dd36ece583e09c52b266004f0d0aae49edbeb16f51774148fc7c18105d2ff7f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zfRybHT64nUaTmDDnx0LOY-39LxxbgxWdZoEmrpiAak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w-t7ytBYbxvvJEB4uKCpT6Q3RcORIRV9_PmG4K798pI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RC-4OYX0VN1FGegd3gcPg6Z7LXPaZklTu8Zj6VXBMQ8\"}"
