Governments worldwide is very concerned about the rapid growth and use of stablecoins. There are more than 200 stablecoins, worth **nearly $130 billion** ‚Äî a six-fold increase from a year ago. We will definitely see regulators attempting to control who issues these coins, the amount circulating, and who is using them for what purposes, among other monitoring...\\n\\nThe US government is also looking for ways to tax crypto transactions. The purchase and sale of crypto may be straight forward to tax, but protocols like DeFi are a bit more complicated and muddy, as users can jump from token to token and use different platforms prior to returning to a fiat currency to show a profit-or-loss. Even the government can not find a straight forward way to tax this transaction, do not be surprised if these apps or platforms are required to turn in all transactions for regulators to review. mmmhhh Subpoenas???\\n\\n**Comprehensive regulation may be positive** as Institutional Investors will feel more comfortable to invest and launch crypto products for the masses to use. This can lead to the growth and appreciation of the industry, but draconian regulation may strangle innovation technology.\\n\\nNext year may be the year when we see many countries opening up to crypto. Today, Europe leads the pack in terms of DeFi deposits, we saw president Mr. Bukele lead El Salvador to become the first economy to adopt [Bitcoin](http://ycobitcoin.com/) as a legal tender. China put the locks on crypto in 2021 by making it completely illegal to trade and mine crypto, benefiting neighboring nations and Texas where many miners relocated to.\\n\\nIndia is number #1 when it comes to [on-chain retail DeFi value received](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1263257/global-defi-adoption-by-country/) and their leaders are still undecided on how to police and regulate this technology. This country, with almost 1.4 billion inhabitants who are very tech oriented, can have a great impact in the industry if regulators understand how to regulate it.\\n\\nGlobal Crypto Adoption (top 20) 2021 - by Chainalysis.\\n\\n> No one really knows what 2022 awaits, but we can be sure that growth and adoption will continue to rise.
