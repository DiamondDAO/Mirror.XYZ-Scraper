"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I talk to hundreds of undergraduate and MBA students a year about the interview process for investment banking. The questions they ask vary widely from person to person but often they conclude with the same question: \\n\\n**“Do you have any advice for the banking recruiting process?”**\\n\\nThinking back sophomore year of college, I remember how opaque the process seems. Thankfully the answers to this question are actually relatively straightforward.\\n\\n## 3 steps:\\n\\n* Technicals\\n  * General Banking (Accounting / Finance / Valuation)\\n  * Industry / Group Specific\\n* The “Why”\\n  * Why banking?\\n  * Why industry \\\\[X\\\\]?\\n* Networking\\n  * With Junior level bankers\\n  * With Senior level bankers\\n\\n\\\\[Add a diagram of how these flow from each other: Networking informs the “why” and the industry / group-specific technicals, the “why” informs networking calls and where you focus your time from a technical standpoint, the banking technicals act as a foundation for the whole system\\\\]\\n\\n## Technicals:\\n\\nTechnicals are first on this list because they are the absolute bare minimum table stakes for getting a job in banking. They constitute the core competency necessary to be successful as a banking analyst. \\n\\nTo put it bluntly: learning banking technicals is not complex, it is simply laborious (just like banking!). The technicals can be memorized with hours of study, forgotten after interviews and refreshed upon starting your internship or full-time role.\\n\\nThat being said, it is imperative you have them down pat.\\n\\n### General Banking\\n\\n* Accounting\\n  * Simple three-statement accounting\\n    * Understand what the three statements are and what they’re used for\\n    * Understand how the three statements flow together and how changes to one sheet affect the others\\n* Finance / Valuation\\n  * Understand the major valuation methodologies (Relative / Intrinsic)\\n    * Comps (Relative)\\n    * Precedents (Relative)\\n    * Discounted Cash Flow (Intrinsic)\\n  * Understand accretion / dilution\\n  * \\\\[ \\\\]\\n* *Resources (feel free to reach out about any of these, not going to post them at the moment since they’re not mine):*\\n  * Necessary:\\n    * M&I Accounting Guide\\n    * M&I Valuation Guide\\n    * M&I 400 question guide\\n  * Other:\\n\\n**LINK STUFF HERE**\\n\\n### Industry / Group Specific Technicals\\n\\nThese vary broadly by industry and often center around valuation methodology. Some industries have very simple valuation methodologies (i.e., valuing a lemonade stand or a widgets manufacturer) whereas some have incredibly complex methodologies (i.e., an \\\\[**early-stage biotechnology company \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*LINK HERE ONCE COMPLETED\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\]**, a healthcare service provider or an E&P company)\\n\\n## The “Why”\\n\\n### Why Banking?\\n\\nThis question is the core of any interview. Why do you want to do “X”. The answer is also the best determinant of if someone will be successful in the role they’re interviewing for.\\n\\nTo answer the “why banking” question, its important have your story down. I’ve found the most convincing answers center around experience gained from talking to others who are either doing banking or have done banking. This obviously ties into networking, of which the purpose is not solely to get access to interviews, but also to help you prepare for them. Have as many conversations as possible with people who have first hand experience doing the the job you want. The conversations you have will be crucial to contextualizing your response to “why banking” and will make your preferences about industry, product and bank more believable. \\n\\n\\\\[probs add more here\\\\]\\n\\n### Why Industry \\\\[X\\\\]?\\n\\nOne of my favorite ways to gauge a candidate’s interest in our industry is to ask them to talk me through trends interesting to them in the space. By starting with a question about trends the conversation naturally progresses to questions about companies operating in the space or recent deals (be that M&A, financing, restructuring, etc.) done in the space.\\n\\nThe easiest way for a candidate to convey their interest in a specific team or industry is to have done some homework and be able to speak intelligently about the space.\\n\\n* Trends\\n  * Utilize industry-focused websites\\n    * If you don’t know any of these for the vertical you’re recruiting for initially, use the networking process to develop a library of resources\\n    * Ex. Tech: [Techcruch.com](https://techcrunch.com/), Biotech: [FierceBiotech](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/)\\n    * Newsletters and Twitter are also very useful for learning about trends and gauging the sentiment of influential people in industries like tech, biotech and crypto\\\\* *(*\\\\*although if interested in crypto/web3, why do banking?!) \\n* Companies\\n  * The easiest way to identify companies in your target industry is to look for which companies are mentioned in the trends you sourced above\\n    * Look into the companies and their competitors\\n      * If public - look into recent press releases, corporate presentations and company filings like 8-Ks or the 14-d9s of companies they’ve acquired\\n        * Going through these resources will help to develop a more wholesome view of what the company does and how they’re positioned in their industry\\n      * If private - look for press releases mentioning the company and their competitors, Crunchbase (for investors and funding information), AngelList (for investors, job openings, competitors)\\n  * By finding competitors and tangentially related companies you’ll develop a more wholesome view of how the industry functions and interacts\\n* Deals\\n  * The easiest way to find interesting deals is to use the same resources as the trends section above (ie industry-specific websites or even sites like WSJ)\\n  * Look at company press releases for recent acquisitions\\n  * Search for “\\\\[Company X\\\\] acquisition of \\\\[…\\\\]” and let google fill in the blank\\n  * **I personally find searching out deals to be the easiest way to go about finding both trends and interesting companies**\\n    * Once you’ve found a large company in the industry of focus you can learn a lot from the acquisitions they’re making\\n    * If a large company is making an acquisition of a company in a specific space it’s likely a tell of either:\\n      * Lack of internal innovation and lagging competitive ability\\n      * A bet on a nascent space (read: trend)\\n    * When looking at the deal it’s important to ask, *Why?*\\n      * *What is the target company doing that’s valuable?*\\n        * Competition with the larger company?\\n        * Innovative product / engineering / community?\\n    * There must be something meaningful going on and the target company must have competitors. Spend time learning what drove the deal and which company might be next (or be the next big company in the space to go it alone!)\\n    * If you go down this rabbit hole, you’ll know that you’re both: \\n      * Well prepared to talk about the industry\\n      * Interested in the space! **(if it’s too hard to spend time learning then find another space you’re more interested in. Wasting time learning about an industry you’re not interested in = ngmi)**\\n\\nBeing able to convey the themes that pervade an industry is the easiest way to make it believable that you’re actually interested in the space. Learn some trends, some companies propagating those trends and some recent deals and you’ll be golden.\\n\\n## Networking\\n\\n### With Junior Bankers\\n\\n\\\\[Higher conversion rate to conversations\\\\]\\n\\n### With Senior Bankers\\n\\n\\\\[More pull when it comes to decision making\\\\]\\n\\n## Useful Vocab / Jargon\\n\\nTypes of Banks (if I left you or your favorite bank out, sorry? not exhaustive):\\n\\n* **Bulge Bracket** - big boy banks that do everything under the sun; M&A, capital raising, derivatives, consumer banking, you name it\\n  * GS, JPM, MS, Citi, Barclays, BofA\\n* **Boutique** - smaller shops, often focused on advisory, some do capital raises\\n  * CVP, Evercore, Moelis, Lazard, PJT, Liontree, Greenhill, Qatalyst\\n  * + a million others\\n* **Middle Market** - basically do all the same stuff as the bulges but with middle market companies\\n  * Willaim Blair, Houlihan, Piper Sandler, Jefferies, Cannacord\\n  * + a million others \\n\\n**Coverage** - the industry that a specific group covers - often used as “coverage area” or “coverage group”\\n\\n* Industrials\\n* Biotech\\n* Tech / Internet\\n* Healthcare (services, tools / diagnostics, digital health, HCIT)\\n* TMT (tech, media, telecom)\\n* Consumer\\n* Power / Energy\\n* Oil / Gas\\n* Private Equity (aka Financial Sponsors)\\n\\n**Product** - the specific thing being sold by the bank\\n\\n* M&A\\n* Capital Markets\\n  * Debt (DCM)\\n  * Convertible debt\\n  * Equity (ECM)\\n* Restructuring\",\"timestamp\":1642022217,\"title\":\"Investment Banking Recruiting \"},\"digest\":\"xBkpADne4GkojMePA046gBSZwpI4ov5GX2t3qWX24TQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeFf595069990591C848998cA809C92d319540cfA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zBq7n8q9WT_ngQAtxuQ7SiFpAZTWtDVdlxxMC2U-1TQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SZ97WBtV3nZYtEBBHZ2NQsv_gF1MtQptsTuM-pJsTGY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CepzD5zdWK_47EJLDfOr1HaQz73do1mIkjb78bc3jHCC_3JdOkeexldPraSjK29GUvtTnYM_wxjPmPRmINfWhw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2079ab6837dbb10a5be37c7059f83b3f6db995438414f76c625dd22cd6a4f9020bf095f62cfbe846c08f220340e018a775fb4cb68f27f429c7c2f900709d4f0f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zBq7n8q9WT_ngQAtxuQ7SiFpAZTWtDVdlxxMC2U-1TQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SZ97WBtV3nZYtEBBHZ2NQsv_gF1MtQptsTuM-pJsTGY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xBkpADne4GkojMePA046gBSZwpI4ov5GX2t3qWX24TQ\"}"
