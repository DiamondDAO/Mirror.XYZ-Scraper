"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Today I decided to try a little experiment: mint ERC-1155 tokens of lost artworks restored with AI, and use them to start a token-gated community.\\n\\nDuring my crypto journey I read a lot of articles and attended many courses to learn about the space and try to see where I could fit: I explored NFTs, social tokens, DeFi, and recently DAOs.\\n\\nSeven months after the beginning I realize I made a lot of mistakes, but today is an attempt to \\\\~start over the NFT adventure with the knowledge I have now.\\n\\nLet me introduce to you MMXVII Collection: the meeting point of Art, AI and Crypto.\\n\\n## The Art ‚ú®\\n\\n![The paintings were made just after I received my drawing tablet. It was so great to finally use one after months of struggling with a touchpad ü•≤](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VgdC-HMYIZlrqm32fMNBE.gif?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\nThe collection is a selection of 5 digital paintings made in October 2017, representing how I felt during that period. Bones, Flowers, Planets and Symbols were elements I was drawn too, so I added them to my work.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the computer where were the original HQ files of the artworks died so I no longer have them üíÄ\\n\\nThe only \\\\~memories of the pieces available today are the posts I made on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/oplerou.archives) but the quality is not really great, since the files are compressed.\\n\\nThis is why I decided to restore them using Artificial Intelligence. üëÄ\\n\\n## AI & Digital Art Restoration ü•≤\\n\\n![‚ú® technology ‚ú®](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8WCjI41wrs3Q0F9Mqgq9U.jpg?height=1500&width=3000&&&&&&&&&&&size=medium)\\n\\nThis is the first time I use AI in my work. It felt weird because I didn‚Äôt know how the result would look like since [the website](https://letsenhance.io/) seemed to be focused on photos, but the result was surprisingly good! The AI-created piece is slightly different from the original one but I LOVE how detailed it looks like.\\n\\nDigital Art Restoration is not something I thought about until now, and now I want to create a series of low definition artworks, just to see how the result will look like‚Ä¶ But for now let‚Äôs talk about the token part of this experiment.\\n\\n## The Social Token\\n\\n![Plexus: Bundle of intersecting nerves or vessels. This is also how my friends call me üíÄ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E3vU0B5F33aygo6PmzMAa.jpg?height=1500&width=3000)\\n\\nSocial tokens are a way for creators like me to interact in a new way with their community, and I had to create one to fully explore Web3 possibilities.\\n\\nIf you often read articles on the Creator Economy x Social Tokens, you might have seen the ‚ÄúImagine you could invest in Taylor Swift at the beginning of her career‚Äù example to explain how early fans would have earned value from her success with her, if she had a token. Well, I am your Taylor Swift üíÄüíÄüíÄ\\n\\nOn a more serious note, I think I have a lot of potential and it would be cool if we grew together \\\\~ \\\\[here‚Äôs a [link to my Tellie](https://tell.ie/OPlerou) if you don‚Äôt know me and want to know what kind of things I do\\\\] (:\\n\\n### Utility\\n\\nThe token will be used to gain access to my Discord Server, where I will regularly post updates about what I‚Äôm working on + early access to my creations. My current priority is [Zouzoukwa](https://tell.ie/OPlerou/zouzoukwa), but I have many other ideas too and you could vote for them in a token race on Mirror ‚ú®\\n\\n### Tokenomics\\n\\nI minted 10,000,000 $PLEXUS and I will airdrop them to my collectors, supporters and the first collectors of MMXVII pieces. I currently don‚Äôt know if I will start a liquidity mining program or things like that, but you will be able help if you have the token by voting (:\\n\\nI will airdrop 700 $PLEXUS to the first collectors of each artwork and 300$PLEXUS to the first collectors of the close-ups.\\n\\n## üî• Let‚Äôs Go üî•\\n\\n### View MMXVII on OpenSea ‚ú®\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/collection/mmxvii/](https://opensea.io/collection/mmxvii/)\\n\\n‡∑¥\",\"timestamp\":1634507980,\"title\":\"Introducing MMXVII Collection: A Digital Art x AI x Social Token Experiment\",\"publication\":\"oplerou\"},\"digest\":\"l8XTbVksFTbD-_ELMbzYHy0jgyyGjdoRBaR1pqlxqsc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa5BFD95294Aee7d66CF7C5981C26C5ae21D217bc\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"o2uedZIna0ZJ1SRtw8h7TO_yEA43iSAgQgDx4zS68iU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Rn9-UPDIUQl0TPUcD2o_m_loinWoDKA0tJ6_nyzFq-U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qguqgrqq1iix85-hzON4YiL1hO-CUJkD7bKZtwRR26pay2piRiuoPt8mDwqgYE72XRJ73vKfMfMQlNtkv8oOJQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9aab105a4b700bb50abb1a075b9132564d63e8d721cb2e95c6f063000b0370f47f0ce3de08c8744b7e33a82b6b6d771bf994c737925a85afbbbb5200983df07f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on oplerou.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"o2uedZIna0ZJ1SRtw8h7TO_yEA43iSAgQgDx4zS68iU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Rn9-UPDIUQl0TPUcD2o_m_loinWoDKA0tJ6_nyzFq-U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HuK2k6WTX0TyeiBD4lEbfh1IZ03qTTc1DH4TDldrG4E\"}"
