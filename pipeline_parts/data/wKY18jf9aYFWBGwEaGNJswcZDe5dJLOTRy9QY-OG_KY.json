"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"The laddies couldna be his sons,\\\" thought the woman.  She made no further inquiry, and the boys escaped scot free.  The culprit afterwards entered the service of the East India Company.  \\\"The boy was father to the man.\\\"  He acquired great reputation at the siege of Seringapatam, where he led the forlorn hope. Erskine was promoted, until in course of time he returned to his native city a full-blown general.  To return to my father's education. After he left \\\"Mammy Smith's, he went for a short time to the original High School.  It was an old establishment, founded by James VI. before he succeeded to the English throne, It was afterwards demolished to make room for the University buildings; and the new High School was erected a little below the old Royal Infirmary.  After leaving the High School, Alexander Nasmyth was taught by his father, first arithmetic and mensuration, next geometry and mathematics, so far as the first three books of Euclid were concerned.  After that, his own innate skill, ability, and industry enabled him to complete the rest of his education.\\n\\nAt a very early period my father exhibited a decided natural taste for art.  He used his pencil freely in sketching from nature; and in course of time he showed equal skill in the use of oil colour.  At his own earnest request he was bound apprentice to Mr. Crighton, then the chief coachbuilder in Edinburgh.  He was employed in that special department where artistic taste was necessary--that is, in decorating the panels of the highest class of carriages, and painting upon them coats of arms, with their crests and supporters.  He took great pleasure in this kind of work.  It introduced him to the practical details of heraldry, and gave him command over his materials.\\n\\nStill further to improve himself in the art of drawing, my father devoted his evenings to attending the Edinburgh Drawing Academy. This institution, termed \\\"The Trustees' Academy of Fine Art,\\\" had been formed and supported by the funds arising from the estates confiscated after the rebellions of 1715 and 1745.  Part of these funds was set apart by Government for the encouragement of drawing, and also for the establishment of the arts of linen weaving, carpet manufacture, and other industrial occupations.\\n\\nThese arts were introduced into Scotland by the French Protestants, who had been persecuted for conscience' sake out of their own country, and settled in England, Ireland, and Scotland, where they prosecuted their industrial callings.  The Corporation was anxious to afford an asylum for these skilled and able workmen.  The emigrants settled down with their families, and pursued their occupations of damask, linen, and carpet weaving.  They were also required to take Scotch apprentices, and teach them the various branches of their trade.  The Magistrates caused cottages and workshops to be erected on a piece of unoccupied land near Edinburgh, where the street appropriately called Picardy Place now stands,--the greater number of the weavers having come from Picardy in France.\\n\\nIn connection with the establishment of these industrial artisans, it was necessary to teach the young Scotch apprentices drawing, for the purpose of designing new patterns suitable for the market.  Hence the establishment by the Trustees of the Forfeited Estate Funds of \\\"The Academy of Fine Art.\\\"  From the designing of patterns, the institution advanced to the improvement of the fine arts generally. Young men who had given proofs of their natural taste for drawing were invited to enter the school and participate in its benefits.\\n\\nAt the time that my father was apprenticed to the coach painter, the Trustees' Academy was managed by Alexander Runciman.  He had originally been a house painter, from which business he proceeded to landscape painting.  \\\"Other artists,\\\" said one who knew him, \\\"talked meat and drink; but Runciman talked landscape.\\\"  He went to Rome and studied art there.  He returned to Edinburgh, and devoted himself to historical painting.  He was also promoted to the office of master of the Trustees' Academy.  When my father called upon him with his drawings from nature, Runciman found them so satisfactory that he was at once admitted as a student.  After his admission he began to study with intense eagerness.  The young men who had been occupied at their business during the day could only attend in the evening.  And thus the evenings were fixed for studying drawing and design.  The Trustees' Academy made its mark upon the art of Scotland: it turned out many artists of great note -- such as Raeburn, Wilkie, my father, and many more.\\n\\nAt the time when my father entered as a student, the stock of casts from the antique, and the number of drawings from the old masters, were very small; so much so, indeed, that Runciman was under the necessity of setting the students to copy them again and again. This became rather irksome to the more ardent pupils.  My father had completed his sixth copy of a fine chalk drawing of \\\"The Laocoon.\\\" It was then set for him to copy again.  He begged Mr. Runciman for another subject.  The quick-tempered man at once said,\\\"l'll give you another subject.\\\"  And turning the group of the Laocoon upside down, he added, \\\"Now, then, copy that!\\\"  The patient youth set to work, and in a few evenings completed a perfect copy.  It was a most severe test; but Runciman was so proud of the skill of his pupil that he had the drawing mounted and framed, with a note of the circumstances under which it had been produced.  It continued to hang there for many years, and the story of its achievement became traditional in the school.\\n\\nDuring all this time my father remained in the employment of Crighton the carriage builder.  He improved in his painting day by day.  But at length an important change took place in his career.  Allan Ramsay, son of the author of The Gentle Shepherd, and then court painter to George III., called upon his old friend Crighton one day, to look over his works.  There he found young Nasmyth painting a coat of arms on the panel of a carriage.  He was so much surprised with the lad's artistic workmanship--for he was then only sixteen--that he formed a strong desire to take him into his service.  After much persuasion, backed by the offer of a considerable sum of money, the coachbuilder was at length induced to transfer my father's indentures to Allan Ramsay.\\n\\nIt was, of course, a great delight to my father to be removed to London under such favourable auspices.  Ramsay had a large connection as a portrait painter.  His object in employing my father was that he should assist him in the execution of the subordinate parts, or dress portions, of portraits of courtiers, or of diplomatic personages. No more favourable opportunity for advancement could have presented itself.  But all this was entirely due to my father's perseverance and advancing skill as an artist--the results of his steady application and labour.\\n\\nRamsay possessed a very fine collection of drawings by the old masters, all of which were free for my father to study.  Ramsay was exceedingly kind to his young pupil.  He was present at all the discussions in the studio, even when the sitters were present. Fellow-artists visited Ramsay from time to time.  Among them was his intimate friend Philip Reinagle--an agreeable companion, and an excellent artist.  Reinagle was one day so much struck with my father's earnestness in filling up some work, that he then and there got up a canvas and made a capital sketch-portrait of him in oil.  It only came into my father's possession some years after Ramsay's death, and is now in my possession.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Alexander Nasmyth.  After Reinagle's Portrait\\n\\nAmong the many amusing recollections of my father's life in London, there is one that I cannot resist narrating, because it shows his faculty of resourcefulness--a faculty which served him very usefully during his course through life.  He had made an engagement with a sweetheart to take her to Ranelagh, one of the most fashionable places of public amusement in London.  Everybody went in full dress, and the bucks and swells wore long striped silk stockings.  My father, on searching, found that he had only one pair of silk stockings left. He washed them himself in his lodging-room, and hung them up before the fire to dry.  When he went to look at them, they were so singed and burnt that he could not put them on. They were totally useless. In this sad dilemma his resourcefulness came to his aid.  The happy idea occurred to him of painting his legs so as to resemble stockings. He went to his water-colour box, and dexterously painted them with black and white stripes.  When the paint dried, which it soon did, he completed his toilet, met his sweetheart and went to Ranelagh. No one observed the difference, except, indeed, that he was complimented on the perfection of the fit, and was asked \\\"where he bought his stockings?\\\"  Of course he evaded the question, and left the gardens without any one discovering his artistic trick.\\n\\nMy father remained in Allan Ramsay's service until the end of 1778, when he returned to Edinburgh to practise on his own behalf the profession of portrait painter.  He took with him the kindest good-wishes of his master, whose friendship he retained to the end of Ramsay's life.  The artistic style of my father's portraits, and the excellent likenesses of his sitters, soon obtained for him ample employment.  His portraits were for the most part full-lengths, but of a small or cabinet size.  They generally consisted of family groups, with the figures about twelve to fourteen inches high.  The groups were generally treated and arranged as if the personages were engaged in conversation with their children; and sometimes a favourite servant was introduced, so as to remove any formal aspect in the composition of the picture.  In order to enliven the background, some favourite view from the garden or grounds, or a landscape, was given; which was painted with as much care as if it was the main feature of the picture. Many of these paintings are still to be found in the houses of the gentry in Scotland.  Good examples of his art are to be seen at Minto House, the seat of the Earl of Minto, and at Dalmeny Park, the seat of the Earl of Rosebery.\\n\\nAmong my father's early employers was Patrick Miller, Esq., of Dalswinton, in Dumfriesshire.  He painted Mr. Miller's portrait as well as those of several members of his family.  This intercourse eventually led to the establishment of a very warm personal friendship between them.  Miller had made a large fortune in Edinburgh as a banker; and after he had partially retired from business, he devoted much of his spare time to useful purposes.  He was a man of great energy of character, and was never idle.  At first he applied himself to the improvement of agriculture, which he did with great success on his estate of Dalswinton.  Being one of the largest shareholders in the Carron Ironworks near Stirling, he also devoted much of his time to the improvement of guns for the Royal Navy.  He was the inventor of that famous gun the Carronade.  The handiness of these short and effective guns, which were capable of being loaded and fired nearly twice as quickly as the long small-bore guns, gave England the victory in many a naval battle, where the firing was close and quick, yardarm to yardarm.\\n\\nBut Mr. Miller's greatest claim to fame arises from his endeavours to introduce steam-power as an agent in the propulsion of ships at sea. Mr. Clerk of Eldin had already invented the system of \\\"breaking the line\\\" in naval engagements--a system that was first practised with complete success by Lord Rodney in his engagement off Martinico in 1780.  The subject interested Mr. Miller so much that he set himself to work to contrive some mechanical method by means of which ships of war might be set in motion, independently of wind, tide, or calms, so that Clerk's system of breaking the line might be carried into effect under all circumstances.\\n\\nIt was about this time that my father was often with Miller; and the mechanical devices by means of which the method of breaking the line could be best accomplished was the subject of many of their conversations.  Miller found that my father's taste for mechanical contrivances, and his ready skill as a draughtsman, were likely to be of much use to him, and he constantly visited the studio.  My father reduced Miller's ideas to a definite form, and prepared a series of drawings, which were afterwards engraved and published.  Miller's favourite design was, to divide the vessel into twin or triple hulls, with paddles between them, to be worked by the crew.  The principal experiment was made in the Firth of Forth on the 2d of June 1787. The vessel was double-hulled, and was worked by a capstan of five bars. The experiment was on the whole successful.  But the chief difficulty was in the propulsive power.  After a spurt of an hour or so, the men became tired with their laborious work.  Mr. Taylor, student of divinity, and tutor of Mr. Miller's sons, was on board, and seeing the exhausted state of the men at the capstan, suggested the employment of steam-power.  Mr. Miller was pleased with the idea, and resolved to make inquiry upon the subject.\\n\\nAt that time William Symington, a young engineer from Wanlockhead, was exhibiting a road locomotive in Edinburgh.  He was a friend of Taylor's, and Mr. Miller went to see the Symington model.  In the course of his conversation with the inventor, he informed the latter of his own project, and described the difficulty he had experienced in getting his paddle-wheels turned round.  On which Symington immediately asked, \\\"Why don't you use the steam-engine?\\\" The model which Symington exhibited, produced rotary motion by the employment of ratchet-wheels. The rectilinear motion of the piston-rod was thus converted into rotary motion.  Mr. Miller was pleased with the action of the ratchet-wheel contrivance, and gave Symington an order to make a pair of engines of that construction.  They were to be used on a small pleasure-boat on Dalswinton Lake.\\n\\nThe boat was constructed on the double-hull or twin plan, so that the paddle should be used in the space between the hulls.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote...  This steam twin boat was in fact the progenitor of the Castalia, constructed about a hundred years later for the conveyance of passengers between Calais and Dover.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nAfter much vexatious delay, arising from the entire novelty of the experiment, the boat and engines were at length completed, and removed to Dalswinton Lake.  This, the first steamer that ever \\\"trod the waters like a thing of life,\\\" the herald of a new and mighty power, was tried on the 14th of October 1788.  The vessel steamed delightfully, at the rate of from four to five miles an hour, though this was not her extreme rate of speed.  I give, on the next page, a copy of a sketch made by my father of this the first actual steamboat, with her remarkable crew.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The first steamboat.  By Alexander Nasmyth\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... The original drawing of the steamer was done by my father, and lent by me to Mr. Woodcroft, Who inserted it in his Origin and Progress of Steam Navigation.  He omitted my father's name, and inserted only that of the lithographer, although it is a document of almost national importance in the history of Steam Navigation.\\n\\nP.S.-- since the above paragraph was written for the first edition, I have been enabled to find the drawing, with another remarkable pencil sketch of my father's, in the Gallery of the Museum of Naval Architecture at South Kensington.  It will henceforward belong to that interesting collection.\\n\\nThe remarkable pencil sketch to which I have referred, is that of a screw propeller, drawn by my father, dated 1819.  It was the result of many discussions as to the proper mode of propelling a vessel.  First, he had drawn Watt's idea of a \\\"spiral oar\\\"; then, underneath, he has drawn his own idea, of a disk of six.  blades, like a screw-jack, immediately behind the rudder.  There is a crank shown on the screw shaft, by which the propeller was driven direct, showing that he was the first to indicate that method of propulsion of steamboats.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nThe persons on board consisted of Patrick Miller, William Symington, Sir William Monteith, Robert Burns (the poet, then a tenant of Mr. Miller's), William Taylor, and Alexander Nasmyth.  There were also three of Mr. Miller's servants, who acted as assistants.  On the edge of the lake was a young gentleman, then on a visit to Dalswinton. He was no less a person than Henry Brougham, afterwards Lord Chancellor of England.  The assemblage of so many remarkable men was well worthy of the occasion.\\n\\nTaking into account the extraordinary results which have issued from this first trial of an actual steamboat, it may well be considered that this was one of the most important circumstances which ever occurred in the history of navigation.  It ought, at the same time, to be remembered that all that was afterwards done by Symington, Fulton, and Bell, followed long after the performance of this ever-memorable achievement.\\n\\nI may also mention, as worthy of special record, that the hull of this first steamboat was of iron.  It was constructed of tinned iron plate. It was therefore the first iron steamboat, if not the first iron ship, that had ever been made.  I may also add that the engines, constructed by Symington, which propelled this first iron steamboat are now carefully preserved at the Patent Museum at South Kensington, where they may be seen by everybody.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote...  The original engines of the boat, with the ratchet-wheel contrivance of Symington, are there: the very engine that propelled the first steamer on Dalswinton Lake. It may be added that Mr. Miller expended about #30,000 on naval improvements, and, as is often the case, he was wholly neglected by the Government.  ...\\\\]\",\"timestamp\":1639288288,\"title\":\"\\nThe boddy Erskine!
