"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In a career littered with outstanding celebrity portraits, Platon is now consumed with human rights causes and is more concerned with and fulfilled by capturing the faces of activists. In 2008, he spent a year documenting civil rights leaders across America as part of a project commissioned by The New Yorker.\\n\\nBut, while his mission is now virtuous, his world leader and celebrity shoots are legendary; he used the camera to tell stories, posing often provocative or eclectic questions — that is his superpower.\\n\\nFor Platon, moving into [NFTs](https://cointelegraph.com/magazine/2021/02/16/nft-artist-beeples-mammoth-5040-day-artwork) was logical. “Photographers, artists, often innovate and seek out new technologies. We like to move into new space and experiment,” he says.\\n\\nHe now revels in his work documenting human rights, working on projects with the U.N. He has set up his own foundation, The People’s Portfolio, which amplifies the voices of the ignored. Important people don’t scare him — he doesn’t scare easily. He quotes Martin Luther King, who said “beware the illusion of supremacy.” The funds raised from these recent NFT drops go straight to this foundation.\\n\\nPlaton’s portrait of Muhammad Ali (Supplied)\\n\\nPlaton treats everyone the same. He doesn’t care if they are a human rights defender, an activist, a former political prisoner, or a head of state.\\n\\n“They’re all people. Be nice. Be curious,” he says.\",\"timestamp\":1639040082,\"title\":\"In a career littered with outstanding celebrity portraits,\"},\"digest\":\"G9UVSulKK6uyikz7TcVWER8bsJmGELKfWZytlScrZhU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x68C9f981a2CEF37445719a678eb61b779EE4CDB1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IX-ogWFVgCdQUDnWewYdZegJviy80ZXFI9ai0vw_T7U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yuRTl6C1akFh8nXL8dFSTdkbtky2rahF1u9P8xYzJrY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7e_G0BfKeSNpvjKMKc93rYgeJRAGZYoXZvadcXoIR_nAH_jz_cQUCDMTaN4Xle2-D_iNl8v0lnyuUajkH-T3Fw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd69fe576cb2ef3f79d3ef36d069b6d2383b9f35129a68576e8e355814811cfee3a7933b940b16b164685653fcf62aa429f162c7674598a2d89a75ef6386fc3581b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"IX-ogWFVgCdQUDnWewYdZegJviy80ZXFI9ai0vw_T7U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"yuRTl6C1akFh8nXL8dFSTdkbtky2rahF1u9P8xYzJrY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"G9UVSulKK6uyikz7TcVWER8bsJmGELKfWZytlScrZhU\"}"
