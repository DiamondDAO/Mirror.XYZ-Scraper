When we make assumptions, we state them. Otherwise, we presume that the future could unfold in many directions.\\n\\nThe futurist ideal is a profession dedicated to the formulation of new ideas and models for studying future possibilities. In practice, however, professional futurists necessarily produce content that is of value to their employers and funders. In many cases, their ideas are of value insofar as they serve to assist the realization of certain outcomes. It is rare for a futurist to be paid to simply think.\\n\\nWe launch our research service and publication project, Cope, with the view that the Mirror platform is a crowdfunding marketplace that makes an economy of ideas feasible. We seek to decouple our research from the conditions and agendas set by institutional funders, and conduct research that we and the Mirror community deem to be of importance. Feedback from our supporters is vital to our process. We imagine a new forum for future thought – research for the hive. Supporters can help steer our lines of inquiry by providing comments, asking questions, suggesting research topics, and by providing financial support for directions that they find valuable. \\n\\nWe methodically piece together plausible scenarios, step by step, using systems theory and applied mathematics. We compile our findings in detailed reports, and release them for small sums. We plan to release reports on a wide range of topics, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/320bf6ce-9d97-46a8-ab5d-1e2b625b7606.jpg?height=1500&width=2700)\\n\\n\\nOur output is high-volume and our turn-arounds are prompt. Successfully crowdfunded reports are released within two weeks, often sooner. At certain intervals we will publish print editions of the entire body of research. These will also include previously unreleased material. All supporters will receive a print edition, regardless of the amount contributed. \\n \\nIf you're into Cope straight away, please support the first issue of our service. We've set a goal in anticipation of ongoing engagement with the distributed community of supporters. The first issue, Cope #1, includes two reports on topics of personal interest. The first report describes a DAO-based software stack for collective ownership of architecture. It outlines a sequence of scenarios in which programmable money, fractional ownership, and distributed governance radically reconfigure how the built environment is constructed and managed. The second report explores an anticipated issue of memory in digital mind engineering, introducing mathematical models to pose questions and offer solutions. Abstracts can be found below.\\n\\n\\n[Cope 01](crowdfund://0xb0c813151d18482a914a2b95b1a25d020532Bb36?network=homestead)\\n\\nWe like Mirror because we see crowdfunding as an opportunity for young professional researchers to break from think tanks, universities, and strategy firms. We take the future too seriously to agree to institutional constraints. By establishing regular feedback with a distributed set of supporters who find our reports valuable, we can create systematic studies of future outcomes – and pathways toward them – without having to trudge through byzantine protocols, semantic ciphers of clients, and conditional funding cycles. By lifting legacy constraints, we can speak about the future unrestrained. \\n\\nWe're also making use of the [Splits](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/splits) feature, which allows us to automatically direct funds to those who have inspired our work. In this case, we’re sending 4% to three people who have laid groundwork for us: [Kei Kreutler](https://www.ourmachine.net/), [Jesse Walden](https://variant.fund/), and [Kristoffer Josefsson](https://foam.space/). Thanks to you all!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## *Cope #01 – Two Reports*\\n\\n# **The BauDAO – An OS for Urban Ownership** \\n-Pierce Myers\\n\\n\\nFractional ownership and distributed governance are programmable mechanisms of the Ownership Economy that will be applied to the expanded field of tangible assets in the city. Real estate is the largest asset class in the world, most locked behind capital barriers, and is the primary mechanism through which the rentier paradigm sustains it’s parasitic extraction of urban value. The Building DAO, or ‘BauDAO’ is a collective-oriented, DAO-based software stack that restructures the paradigm of architectural funding, construction, and ownership. The BauDAO includes software mechanisms that 1) reduce the organizational complexity of fractional ownership of urban assets, 2) enable tiered governance protocols for determining ‘program’, and 3) sharply decrease capital barriers to ownership by orders of magnitude through crowdfunding. \\n \\nThis report diagrams the software architecture (BIM wrapped in DAO) and the unique role of Architects themselves in triggering this paradigm of distributed urban ownership. The report begins with two near-term cases: a large creative collective acquiring studio space and a neighborhood-based residential building project, then speculates on mid-to-long-term scenarios for how these software-economic mechanisms can reshape cities and ecosystems in concert.\\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6517c066-8cd6-4f2b-9ac2-2c4baa57f5e1.jpg?height=2077&width=2700)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/31682ae9-1372-4dc0-afd2-be8cfbefdba8.jpg?height=1828&width=2700)\\n\\n\\n\\n# **The Problem of Memory in Digital Minds** \\n-James Douglas Boyd\\n\\nDigital minds will differ from human ones in that they will be both intelligent agents and products of the engineering designs of others. It may not always be easy for a digital mind to differentiate the aspects of its intelligence that are autonomous and those that are features of others’ designs. Memory is one such aspect. We consider an experiment that a digital mind can conduct and two measures that it can estimate for choosing among hypotheses regarding the origins of its memories.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e42a92f8-2e95-463b-b022-d32d4726fbba.png?height=1084&width=2388)\\n\\n\\n\\n### *Going Forward*\\nAs Cope grows, the issues will include more reports from a diversity of future thinkers. The content will become multimedia, and Splits will be automatically sent to thinkers or creators who inspire our work. In the coming weeks, we will introduce feedback mechanisms supported by platforms such as Google Forms, Gather, and Twitch. \\n\\n\\n\\n### **Thanks,** \\n### **-Cope**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1620598685,\"title\":\"Issue #01\",\"publication\":\"cope\"},\"digest\":\"IMLME8N51RAcn7Z8TG2_-UQy3pkaQ-WtqDvH9Lf27vw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5E692Fe3d06414D75380604BA202c7d5ed94f219\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Oz2K-eXkzku1h-Ri9Wf8OSWPKtz1FcKcNbn0e8M_afY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZXx-8CaEz_Jsj7XVkH5YRuc6xqV0P5fbo4Bi_GKC3jA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-bs3BqniajUOJIHwf9pFRYli3tdfRKQRJn2cMJZSeqGSAXND7Ao7FvaAdLmSnKv15Qabduim0Y46WsubZMHJ5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5e43d388301d7d0435ef971ebbefd3dfd85cf3ec5ce452a38fd00a889b1b25195a462e09ad3298e3d3ca70d4288fafac5f22605a9a01a87efa2424b5a017c0631b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on cope.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Oz2K-eXkzku1h-Ri9Wf8OSWPKtz1FcKcNbn0e8M_afY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZXx-8CaEz_Jsj7XVkH5YRuc6xqV0P5fbo4Bi_GKC3jA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GTSLTwaY78d11sLiWJHaiYR39UOeya4F9x58mHPVVWQ\"}"
