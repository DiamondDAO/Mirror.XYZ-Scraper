"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My grandfather is Polish, and his mother taught my grandmother how to make these delicious perogies. The recipe has been in the family for generations, with a few alterations of course! Serve plain, or with butter, sour cream, bacon, etc. Perfecting the perogie technique takes time, and after a while, you will develop your own system.\\n\\n[ \\n ](https://www.allrecipes.com/cook/1146320/)Directions\\n\\nInstructions Checklist\\n\\n* Step 1\\n\\n  In a large bowl, stir together the flour and salt. In a separate bowl, whisk together the butter, sour cream, eggs, egg yolk and oil. Stir the wet ingredients into the flour until well blended. Cover the bowl with a towel, and let stand for 15 to 20 minutes.\\n* Step 2\\n\\n  Place potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain, and mash with shredded cheese and cheese sauce while still hot. Season with onion salt, salt and pepper. Set aside to cool.\\n* Step 3\\n\\n  Separate the perogie dough into two balls. Roll out one piece at a time on a lightly floured surface until it is thin enough to work with, but not too thin so that it tears. Cut into circles using a cookie cutter, perogie cutter, or a glass. Brush a little water around the edges of the circles, and spoon some filling into the center. Fold the circles over into half-circles, and press to seal the edges. Place perogies on a cookie sheet, and freeze. Once frozen, transfer to freezer storage bags or containers.\\n* Step 4\\n\\n  To cook perogies: Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Drop perogies in one at a time. They are done when they float to the top. Do not boil too long, or they will be soggy! Remove with a slotted spoon.\",\"timestamp\":1640344312,\"title\":\"Grandma's Polish Perogies\"},\"digest\":\"6HshsyR0qgi9lkxd5Fq5WtbDs5IDxFuCoew5Dr_JsHY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4B4068443a228a62e6476c4CA0E9A1e955E97750\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-ZYqEt2xyYVFBK4SKicPc90W1J5XJk-nIyuaxXHRgZY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A5WWh0nYfPNtT-U74GYuycr_MSakGxuNglTxnkB2JeA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Up6PcRlSqmvhozM-6LFwP3ZzAOt0wpqEiwGgxAtRKf5Y1vqGnwI-ddjrHLcJCt5qDuwogkM98yqA-DM8S6Anww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa737e89b02550a99eaae62e631f2af86ec22018595d09aecdf36186a59ab19d757956792bbc6029952ef94b1c01caa888ccf349774abbe7948bfd1f05659c3491b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-ZYqEt2xyYVFBK4SKicPc90W1J5XJk-nIyuaxXHRgZY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"A5WWh0nYfPNtT-U74GYuycr_MSakGxuNglTxnkB2JeA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6HshsyR0qgi9lkxd5Fq5WtbDs5IDxFuCoew5Dr_JsHY\"}"
