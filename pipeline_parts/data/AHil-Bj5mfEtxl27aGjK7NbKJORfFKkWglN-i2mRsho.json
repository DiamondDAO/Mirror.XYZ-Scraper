After two weeks of onboarding, planning, and networking, we knew it was time to mint. We instituted the “Round” method of minting works in groups every Wednesday and Saturday. To date, 14 of those artists have successfully minted and released their first NFTs out into the world. This post serves as a highlight and reference to memorialize the group that started it all.\\n\\n\\n**Key Stats**\\n\\n14 Artists\\nFrom Argentina to Indonesia (Representing 6 Countries)\\n2 Workshops (Featuring Cooper Turley and Osinachi)\\n2 Weeks\\n4 Rounds\\n\\n**Artists**\\n\\n✺ [Eddington Again](https://twitter.com/eddingtonagain)\\n✺ [Tondji](https://twitter.com/t0ndji)\\n✺ [Cy Tone](https://twitter.com/cy_tone)\\n✺ [Kenneth Lartey](https://twitter.com/knnylrty)\\n✺ [Rimbawan Gerilya](https://twitter.com/RIMBAWANGERILYA)\\n✺ [Ravi Vasavan](https://twitter.com/ravivasavan) \\n✺ [Niall Ashley](https://twitter.com/niallashley_)\\n✺ [Sky Kawano](https://twitter.com/skykawano)\\n✺ [Tigris](https://twitter.com/tigrisli)\\n✺ [Baran Acar](https://twitter.com/_acarimo)\\n✺ [Ikaro Cavalcante](https://twitter.com/occult3d)\\n✺ [Magdalena Molinari](https://twitter.com/maggiemolinari)\\n✺ [Christopher de la Guardia / Dela](https://twitter.com/artofdela)\\n✺ [Ben Makgetlane](https://twitter.com/benmakgetlane)\\n\\n## What We Learned\\n\\nDuring the onboarding & minting process, We recognized a few things:\\n\\n> Not everyone's NFT will sell immediately;\\n> Artists need more than just one stipend to mint creative works;\\n> Not every artist will mint in a specific timeframe.\\n\\nTo accommodate this, and to celebrate all of our artists, we are experimenting with **$RECAP NFTs** — a special 1/1 gif that cycles through the artwork of our batch groups that will be auctioned off with the proceeds being split among each artist of that batch group, $BOUNTY holders, $BOUNTY NFT Auction Winner and Mint Fund DAO (a total of 47 recipients).\\n\\nTo do this, we are deploying Mint Fund's crowdfunded [Reserve Auction ($BOUNTY)](https://mint.mirror.xyz/mDws2xGmJCq55ehGDdcv8tGDCpSd_c_CfeqhexiKSqU), and using Mirror recently introduced Splits Auction feature. \\n\\nWe believe in redistribution at every level, and with our $RECAP series, we can ensure that artists can earn ETH so they can continue minting.\\n\\n[Token #3051](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3051)\\n\\n**Split Allocation**\\n\\n14 Batch 01 Artists / 80%\\n31 $BOUNTY Holders / 10%\\n$BOUNTY NFT Auction Winner / 5%\\nMintFund DAO / 5%\\n\\n*The Final distribution percentage was rounded for simplicity.

We are in the process of minting our second batch of artists and currently curating our third and fourth groups. We are actively looking for community moderators in multiple timezones, efforts in localizing resources in most common languages, and programming for our growing artist body. \\n\\n**MINT FUND NFT GALLERY + CURATION SPACE**\\nAs we work with each creator to mint their first NFTs, we’ll be adding their work to our site. This is a space to nurture and highlight the artists we work with. A place to give them all some extra shine. In addition, we will enable auctions using the $BOUNTY auction method to help our artists sell their first NFTs. This also grants curators an opportunity to submit works for MintFund $BOUNTY holders to collect a % of the auction fee from curated sales.\\n\\nStay tuned.
