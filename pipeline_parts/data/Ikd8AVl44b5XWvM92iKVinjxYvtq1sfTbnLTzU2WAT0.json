The climate measures in particular need to be settled before Biden heads to Scotland for the UN climate summit this weekend, so other nations will see our commitment to reduce carbon emissions.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Biden met with key Democrats to work out spending and tax provisions. Yet every senate Republican and at least two senate Democrats continue to assert that Biden’s agenda is too costly.\\n\\nToo costly? Really? Compare the Biden’s social and climate package’s current *compromise* tab of $2tn (spread out over the next 10 years) with:\\n\\n## The $1.9 trillion Trump Republican tax cut that went mostly to the wealthy and large corporations.\\n\\nAmericans were promised that its benefits would “trickle down” to average workers. They didn’t. Corporations used them to finance more stock buybacks. The wealthy used them to buy more shares of stock (and shares of private-equity and hedge funds).\\n\\nThe Trump Republican tax cut should be repealed to pay for Biden’s social and climate package. There is no good reason to retain it. But no senate Republican will vote for its repeal, nor will Arizona’s Kyrsten Sinema – making it a political non-starter in a chamber where Democrats have just half the votes.\\n\\n## The $2.1 trillion that America’s 750 billionaires have raked in just since the start of the pandemic.\\n\\nYou might think that at least a portion of this windfall should help pay for Biden’s agenda since much of it has been the result of monopoly power (for example, Amazon’s dominance over e-commerce during the pandemic).\\n\\nOregon Senator Ron Wyden, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, is proposing a “Billionaires Income Tax,” to be paid by the roughly 750 Americans with $1bn in assets or $100m in income for three consecutive years. It would be a yearly tax on the increasing value of their assets – such as stocks and bonds – regardless of when they sell. They could still write off losses every year. Interestingly, neither Sinema nor West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, the other holdout, has voiced opposition to Wyden’s proposal.\\n\\n## The nearly $8 trillion we’ll be spending on the military over the next 10 years.\\n\\nThe United States already spends more on our military than the next 10 biggest military spenders in the world *combined*.\\n\\nLast week, the Senate Appropriations Committee unveiled a nearly $726bn budget for the Defense Department in 2022. That was about $20bn more than Biden requested. Some $14bn in other funds are set aside for the Pentagon in separate military construction and energy appropriations bills, bringing the total budget to about $740 billion. Over ten years, that comes close to $8tn.\\n\\nTalk about bloat and waste: That military budget includes 85 F-35 fighters costing a total of $1.5tn*.* The F-35 is so plagued with problems that the current chairman of House Armed Service Committee calls [it](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/23/house-768-billion-defense-bill-514085) a “rathole,” and the Pentagon’s own official who’s [responsible for the acquisition of weapons systems](https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/35-fighter-plan-acquisition-malpractice-pentagon-official/story?id=15530008) says spending more on it is “acquisition malpractice.”\\n\\nBut you don’t hear about this in the media because Democrats routinely join Republicans to vote for the military budget – it’s truly bipartisan bloat -- and the media tends to report only on controversies.\\n\\nConsidering these three gigantic pots of money, how is it possible for anyone to argue that America cannot afford to spend what’s needed for childcare, education, paid leave, or to reduce climate change?\\n\\nThe short answer: it’s not possible. Biden’s plan is easily affordable by the richest nation in the world.\\n\\n* Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of [Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few](https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Capitalism-Many-Not-Few/dp/0345806220) and [The Common Good](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052552049X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0).

With the world's eyes on the crucial UN climate summit, the Guardian will bring you the facts, negotiations, news and science. For years, climate experts have stressed that Guardian reporting - independent, rigorous, persistent and open to all - is a critical tool to confront the climate crisis, which is intensifying around the world. Leaders, influenced by powerful lobbies, are now set to make decisions that will determine our future.\\n\\nWe have no shareholders and no billionaire owner.

This helps everyone keep track of global events like the climate summit, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.\\n\\nWe take this emergency seriously as a news organisation: two years ago, we pledged to prioritise the climate crisis, and we've published some 6,000 pieces of environmental journalism since. We set ambitious targets to green our business, and have turned away from fossil fuel investments and advertising as a result.
