"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is a brain dump of what I think is a good overview to get started learning about web3.\\n\\nLet start by looking at why web3 matters. Below is a really good tweet thread by Chris Dixon, a partner at [a16z](https://a16z.com/crypto/), who is focused on web3.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1442201621266534402)\\n\\nWhy web3 matters: <https://future.a16z.com/why-web3-matters/>\\n\\n**Quick summary:**\\n\\nWeb1 (roughly 1990-2005) was about open protocols that were decentralized and community-governed. Most of the value accrued to the edges of the network — users and builders.\\n\\nWeb2 (roughly 2005-2020) was about siloed, centralized services run by corporations. Most of the value accrued to a handful of companies like Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook.\\n\\nWe are now at the beginning of the web3 era, which combines the decentralized, community-governed ethos of web1 with the advanced, modern functionality of web2.\\n\\nWeb3 is the internet owned by the builders and users, orchestrated with tokens.\\n\\n**Here’s how I view the web3 landscape:**\\n\\n 1. Tokens\\n 2. Wallets\\n    1. [metamask](https://metamask.io/), [rainbow](https://rainbow.me/), [coinbase wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet) (these are all self-custody wallets meaning you control the private keys/seed phrase\\n 3. NFTs\\n 4. NFT Marketplaces\\n    1. [Opensea](https://opensea.io/) ($10b valuation and largest marketplace)\\n 5. Centralized exchanges\\n    1. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en), [FTX](https://ftx.com/), [Gemini](https://www.gemini.com/), [Crypto.com](https://crypto.com/)\\n 6. Decentralized exchanges ([Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/))\\n    1. Allows people to swap tokens (i.e. swap ETH for $GALA)\\n 7. Staking protocols\\n    1. [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) (overview [article](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/12/05/olympus-dao-might-be-the-future-of-money-or-it-might-be-a-ponzi/)), [Time Wonderland](https://www.wonderland.money/) (overview [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbq2zcm0UHk))\\n 8. DAOs\\n    1. [FlamingoDAO](https://flamingodao.xyz/), [FWB](https://www.fwb.help/join)\\n 9. Play-to-earn games\\n    1. [Axie](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Gala](https://app.gala.games/), [Wolf Game](https://wolf.game/)\\n10. Metaverse\\n    1. [Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/)\\n11. Software Dashboards to track holdings\\n    1. [Zapper.fi ](https://zapper.fi/)\\n12. Taxes\\n    1.

They [raised $55m](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/22/nft-music-platform-royal-closes-55m-funding-round-led-by-a16z/) in Nov 2021 from a16z, chainsmokers and others after previously [raising $16m](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/08/26/3lau-raises-16m-to-tokenize-music-royalties-for-artists-and-fans/) just 3 months prior ($71m total raised). \\n* [Flyfish Club](https://www.flyfishclub.com/) (check out this [youtube overview video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwaNbe3zK6c)) - Gary Vee’s new [NFT membership restaurant](https://kilegal.com/nft-restaurant-to-open-in-nyc-in-fall-of-2022/) in NYC. Think of this like a membership club similar to [Zero Bond](https://zerobondny.com/) or [Soho House](https://www.sohohouse.com/) where you have to have the token (NFT) in your wallet to gain access.\\n* [IndexCoop](https://www.indexcoop.com/) / [TokenSets](https://www.tokensets.com/) - Create, manage, and grow your own index fund of tokens\\n* Liquidity Protocols  - Stake crypto and earn interest or borrow assets\\n  * [Aave](https://aave.com/) \\n  * [Compound Finance](https://compound.finance/) \\n  * [Rari Capital](https://rari.capital/) \\n    * They also offer their [Fuse pools](https://app.rari.capital/fuse) product which allows anyone to lend, borrow, and create isolated lending pools (community created pools)\\n  * [Yearn Finance](https://yearn.finance/)\\n\\n**DAO Tools / Resources:**\\n\\n1.

I’ll add more people to my list later on but for now it’s a good start. \\n\\nI’m also excited about more projects than I listed above but want to do more research on them before I commit to adding them to this list.\\n\\nAs I learn about more things in web3 and find them interesting, I’ll also add them here.\",\"timestamp\":1639614472,\"title\":\"Ryan's Web3 Getting Started Guide\"},\"digest\":\"M_prKaP6lrc1gx3WRNQlFOr4_FQhX0Ie9X6MzkF7ydA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7D2f3759C6F870E8bBDaB368A7d7e158e41761EA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2abRzDwMgcub2a5Sm1Z2TgttamN7--fesHhOxXmpQYo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"leT-4dGnMso01m8IHauQSWst8jVYPsZE70-nwu1YEhM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TMjBh15CvsEjQjR6IaxXFGaUMSJvcg3oEU3DPewPYTuTUCQWQPwagQQedu0Wl10VOD4MS-To04D1RMV2qBP1-w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfa951e462369c70bfd6a553547e466c627b3d34881dd00f4fb037570698202774b5d6a1d2563aa52851034df7430fdbb452ddc01d5781366d278d85e222543551c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2abRzDwMgcub2a5Sm1Z2TgttamN7--fesHhOxXmpQYo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"leT-4dGnMso01m8IHauQSWst8jVYPsZE70-nwu1YEhM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8Wfw1MDMkCV90iiCWAedqHs_UhytkVQvzzq6gRx7VSc\"}"
