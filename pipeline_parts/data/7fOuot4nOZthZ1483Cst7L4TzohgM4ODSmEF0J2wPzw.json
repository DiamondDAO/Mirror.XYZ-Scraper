"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Internet communities have sprung up everywhere. On Reddit, a group called wallstreetbets is discussing which stocks to trade. On Whatsapp, sporting clubs are arranging fixtures. On Instagram, people are gathering to champion environmental causes.\\n\\nBut something interesting is happening in some of these online groups – not only are they coming together to communicate, they are also making decisions, much like an association or a company.\\n\\n[Take the Gamestop phenomenon.](https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/gamestop-surges-and-no-one-truly-knows-why-20210226-p5761z) Gathering on Reddit, hundreds of retail investors decided to buy shares in the struggling video game retailer, hoping to squeeze out hedge funds who had bet the stock would fall. It worked.\\n\\n“This signifies an incredibly disruptive moment in traditional capitalism through centralised entities,” says Joni Pirovich, founder and principal of Blockchain & Digital Assets Services + Law. \\n\\nWhile Gamestop involved individual activists buying shares with their own accounts, elsewhere on the internet, collective action is going deeper: hundreds of new internet communities are allowing members to own and manage a business.\\n\\nThe mission of the enterprise is being put into computer code, along with all the operating rules. The protocols operate on a decentralised network of computers. These are known as ‘decentralised autonomous organisations’ or DAOs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThey are powerful because they allow groups of like-minded people to make decisions, vote and act. They have built-in treasuries that can be accessed only fi the group approves. Decisions are made via voting processes, ensuring everyone has a voice.\\n\\nIf it were a DAO, wallstreetbets groups could not only talk about the stocks that members should go out and buy, but allow members to contribute funds and invest them after a democratic vote. A sporting club could set up a DAO allowing members to decide whether the budget is spent on new football jerseys, or a fridge for the tuckshop. Environmentalists can allocate donations to the campaigns they see as the most important.\\n\\n> If it becomes law, Australia could be the first country to formally recognise the DAO as a legal structure.\\n\\nDAO protocols are powerful because they are transparent. They allow computer rules to create trust, rather than discretion being given to some manager you don’t know. A CEO or treasurer can’t spend funds on their whim. All the spending is tracked, the decision-making is open for all to see, and the code governing a DAO is available for anyone to check and verify.\\n\\nAll of this is not theoretical: hundreds of DAOs have appeared on the Ethereum blockchain, a distributed network that provides more functionality than the one that operates the bitcoin cryptocurrency. The power of Ethereum is it allows “smart contracts” that codify and execute business rules.\\n\\nSome of the best-known DAOs are appearing in the financial services space, in an area known as ‘decentralised finance’ or DeFi. These include Uniswap, Sushi Swap, Synthetix, Compound and Aave. But many others have appeared in areas relating to grants, social media, traditional media, gaming, collectables and computer operating systems.\\n\\nHowever, these new business models have also created risks for developers and members of the communities. They operate in a legal black hole. Laws don’t recognise them as legal entities. This makes it hard to hire staff, rent premises, take out insurance and attract investors. More concerning is the potential legal liability that might attach if the law views them as equivalent to a partnership, making members jointly and severally liable for losses.\\n\\nNow a [landmark report by an Australian Senate committee this week plans to overcome this uncertainty](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/senate-report-proposes-model-to-regulate-the-crypto-economy-20211020-p591jh) by bringing DAOs into the mainstream. If it becomes law, Australia could be the first country to formally recognise the DAO as a legal structure. This would provide the protection of limited liability to those involved, and open up pools of institutional capital by recognising the model as a proper legal entity.\\n\\n“This signifies an incredibly disruptive moment in traditional capitalism through centralised entities,” says Joni Pirovich, a lawyer and one of the founding members of the Digital Law Association, which proposed the DAO Limited model to the committee.\\n\\n## RELATED\\n\\n### Digital lawyers call for a new legal entity: the DAO Limited\\n\\nIf legislated, traditional capital raising forums like the ASX, which is filled with speculative mining companies operating opaquely paying expensive fees to managers and advisers, could come under pressure. Rather than form a traditional company, a speculative miner might form a limited liability DAO, raise capital through a token and allow a global community to watch and participate in the development of a tenement.\\n\\n“That is a competitive threat to centralised investment companies via shares, where senior executives give themselves bonuses without accountability and don’t share profits with their customers, that has created distrust in large organisations,” Pirovich says. “That is part of the movement and why people identify with a decentralised autonomous organisation.”\\n\\nThe Senate report wants Treasury to set guidance on how DAOs might operate so regulators don’t stifle their growth.\\n\\nRMIT associate professor Chris Berg: “A company has a mandate to operate on behalf of its shareholder, but a DAO is its shareholders.” Supplied\\n\\n“It is astoundingly forward-thinking,” says Chris Berg, associate professor, RMIT University. “A company has a mandate to operate on behalf of its shareholder, but a DAO *is* its shareholders.\\n\\n“The proposal is not to turn all corporations into DAOs but to provide entrepreneurs with a new option on the menu when they are considering how to structure a corporate form. It is a structure that is designed to facilitate decentralisation and provide the legal protections and certainty that traditional investors, or employees working for the DAO, need to go about the lives.”\\n\\nAustralian-based creators of DAOs say the recommendations of the report, titled *Final Report, The Senate Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre* , if implemented, could put Australia at the centre of a rapidly growing global industry.\\n\\nPat McNab is the co-founder of[ Mycelium, which developed the Tracer DAO, a platform for trading “perpetual swaps”](https://www.afr.com/companies/financial-services/meet-the-defi-developers-who-ve-raised-funds-for-a-derivatives-system-20210628-p5850t), which are derivatives that don’t require trading of the underlying asset and will allow users to build new markets for hedging a wider range of risks. He says an Australian DAO law would act as a magnet for entrepreneurs.\\n\\n“There are billions of dollars and many DAOs set up purely on Ethereum that are looking for a jurisdiction to anchor themselves to, which provides a court system, enforcement, and a reasonable tax rate. A few DAOs have looked to places like Switzerland, but Australia, if appropriate regulation comes into place, could be an attractive place for DAOs to ‘safe harbour’ and anchor into, which in our eyes is extremely positive,” he says.\\n\\nMycelium co-founder Pat McNab: “It is a clear, open framework that is transparent.” Paul Harris\\n\\n“DAOs, in terms of their smart contracts infrastructure, provide more cost-effective decision-making frameworks for organisations. It is a clear, open framework that is transparent. You can clearly see the flow of funds, the voting outcomes, there is resistance to fraud – the implications are massive, we have only seen the tip of the iceberg.”\\n\\nThere is a still a long way to go, but the US state of Wyoming has made inroads into recognising decentralised entities. In July, it passed DAO LLC legislation that attempts to close the gap between formalised corporate structures and unincorporated groups governed by smart contracts.\\n\\nIt recognised, DAOs are useful for collectively raising and deploying money, operating fast-moving marketplaces, and that they underpin much of the decentralised finance infrastructure challenging traditional banking.\\n\\nWyoming has formalised protection for DAO developers and those who participate, prohibiting lawsuits against DAOs as general partnerships and giving DAOs rights as legal persons in state court.\\n\\n“It borrowed the best of both worlds, from the corporation and the partnership,” says Michael Bacina, a partner at Piper Alderman. “It offers limited liability for shareholders and informal procedures for decision-making by partners.”\\n\\n## RELATED\\n\\n### Senate report proposes model to regulate the crypto economy\\n\\n## RELATED\\n\\n### What life is like in cryptocurrency land\\n\\n“If a company can be a nexus of people working together, and we can automate the role of directors, there are profound ways we can work more efficiently,” he says. “This could be a generational shift in corporate legislation, though it will be a challenging model to interface and require a higher degree of computer literacy than currently. But it sets the path for digitally native generations to operate much more efficiently and transparently.”\\n\\nAs it stands, DAOs are only understood by a small group of digital asset lawyers, but Pirovich reckons the structure will eventually come into the mainstream.\\n\\n“For lawyers, DAOs are the new global corporate structure,” she says. “They will become a tool in the tool belt of all professional advisers and rapidly expand, especially if Australia recognises a limited liability DAO.”\\n\\n**[James Eyers](https://www.afr.com/by/james-eyers-j7gbd)** writes on banking, fintech and technology.
