"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Why do we often emphasize openness? Because of decentralization, everyone can become a creator is the most fundamental feature of DeFi.\\n\\nNow as this emerging market gradually grows, its development is indeed diverse, complex and highly integrated.\\n\\nBut then we should note that whether it is DAO governance, team decision-making, capital and whale control of the market, or more and more agreements, gradually embrace the supervision of governments. It seems that everyone has gradually acquiesced to this direction of development-it should be more controlled.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9msMsGQ2b70exQ7KD863v.png?height=500&width=900)\\n\\nWe have adapted to the shackles. It is true that the editor believes that a certain level of supervision will indeed bring more protection to players, but the thinking of the project team should not be encumbered by it.\\n\\nAlways remember that the reason why DeFi was born, developed, and considered to fundamentally change the way the world economy operates is that it is different from the excessive monopoly and opacity of traditional finance.\\n\\nWhy is Uniswap successful?\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AaqcF_Vji57Ml0DGfYA5f.png?height=608&width=1080)\\n\\nThis is not only because of its AMM model, but also because it provides a sufficiently free and unconstrained place where everyone can construct different trading pairs without approval, and everyone can inject liquidity without authorization.\\n\\nThis will inevitably lead to more irrationality and fraud, but we also need to understand and accept, because the negative effect of risk brought by freedom is the high-level threshold of DeFi.\\n\\nThere are also some creative project teams dedicated to tapping the huge potential of \\\"openness\\\", such as this very interesting project I will introduce below—Euler Finance.\\n\\nEuler Finance\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vWAp3SRPwlHjQv_xi-FVx.png?height=590&width=1050)\\n\\nEuler, a decentralized lending agreement that focuses on long-tail market assets, is not a new project (it is not yet online). As early as June 2020, Euler won the first place in the Spark College Hackathon online competition organized by Encode Club.\\n\\nEuler is an agreement based on lending agreements such as Aave and Compound. It allows users to create their own lending market for any ERC-20 Token. It also provides a Reactive interest rate model to reduce governance intervention.\\n\\nThe main reason for its ability to provide lending functions for long-tail market assets is that Euler introduced the time-weighted average price, a building block used by Uniswap V3.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qM-eYdJFr8uJz4scFvOOD.png?height=607&width=1080)\\n\\nIn terms of financing, Euler's performance is also very impressive:\\n\\nAfter Euler completed the $800,000 seed round of financing at the end of 2020, at the end of August 2021, Euler completed the $8 million Series A financing led by the well-known blockchain investment institution Paradigm.\\n\\nEuler has many innovations that have never appeared before in DeFi projects, including unlicensed listing, Reactive interest rate, anti-MEV liquidation, multi-collateralized asset stable pool, and so on.\\n\\nThis time we first introduce its \\\"openness\\\" feature-the magic idea of ​​a permissionless listing mechanism.\\n\\nUnlicensed listing mechanism\\n\\nThe Euler lending market will mainly rely on assets with WETH trading pairs on Uniswap V3, and then these assets will be divided into isolation layer, cross-layer and mortgage layer with three different levels of risk and return.\\n\\nAny asset that has a WETH pair on Uniswap v3 can be directly added as a lending market on Euler by anyone.\\n\\n1. Isolation layer assets: used for ordinary lending, but cannot be used as collateral. In addition, borrowing different assets requires different accounts on Euler.\\n2. Cross-layer assets: It can be used for ordinary lending and cannot be used as collateral, but it is possible to borrow multiple cross-layer assets with one account.\\n3. Mortgage layer assets: used for ordinary lending, cross-borrowing, and can also be used as collateral. (Cross-borrowing: users mortgage assets in one account to borrow multiple mortgage-level assets)\\n\\nOf course, the capital efficiency of mortgage assets is the highest, allowing both borrowers and lenders to use their assets flexibly in the lending market, but at the same time they also face more liquidation risks.\\n\\nIn addition, EUL holders (its project Token) can upgrade isolation layer assets to cross-layer assets or mortgage layer assets through governance.\\n\\nInnovation analysis\\n\\nAny asset can be pledged and borrowed through Euler (currently only supports ERC-20Token):\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F5BIpcTr4QUG6KeOqchfU.png?height=584&width=1080)\\n\\nWith the help of Uniswap's decentralized time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracle, any user can create his own lending market, instead of requiring community voting to decide whether to list a certain Token like other protocols.\\n\\nRisk minimization: Euler will adjust the loan-to-lending ratio based on the relative risk coefficients of the user's mortgaged assets and loaned assets, which will greatly help reduce the agreement settlement rate.\\n\\nReactive interest rate: The interest rate model supported by control theory can ensure that Euler's currency market can adapt to the real-time fluctuating market environment without governance intervention.\\n\\nTime weighted average price\\n\\nIn order to be able to calculate whether a loan is over-collateralized, Euler needs to monitor the value of user assets.\\n\\nThe reason why I did not choose to use various systems to obtain prices from off-chain sources and put them on the chain is because every time Euler needs to create a new loan market, it requires centralized intervention.\\n\\nTherefore, Euler relies on Uniswap v3's TWAP oracle to evaluate the solvency of users. The reference asset used to standardize Euler prices is WETH.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kPHZlo01v7fFOf-uCXgI9.png?height=768&width=1080)\\n\\nTime-weighted average price (TWAP) records the price and length of time in the Uniswap Token pool for a period of time, and then calculates the average price during this period.\\n\\nThe time-weighted average price mechanism means that the Euler market will not be affected by the short-term price. The manipulator must make the Token high (or low) for a period of time to influence the market.\\n\\nOf course, this also shows that flash loans, a borrowing method that needs to be completed within the same block, cannot be used in Euler.\\n\\naudit\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bj4A6tVZDQnutFRpFz0QL.png?height=214&width=1080)\\n\\nAt present, Euler has successively completed smart contract audits conducted by Solidified, ZK Labs and Halborn, and none of the critical vulnerabilities have been found.\\n\\nAlchemy researcher summary\\n\\nJudging from the naming of the project and the official logo, it seems to be a tribute to the Euler angle of the great mathematician Leonhard Euler in the 18th century; and in the Euler project's vision, any Token can realize the mortgage loan function.\\n\\nAs a DeFi 2.0 lending agreement, Euler can not only provide maximum capital efficiency, but also safely reduce various types of risks, which can be described as a revolutionary innovation and challenge.\\n\\nThis time we cut from the perspective of \\\"openness\\\" and deeply explored Euler's \\\"permissionless\\\" mechanism.
