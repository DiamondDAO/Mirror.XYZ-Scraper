The value of xLON increases in proportion with distributed staking rewards. This makes the exchange ratio between xLON and LON continue to rise and xLON : LON ≥ 1.\\n\\n**xLON Smart Contract Risk: B-**\\n\\nLON was deployed in December 2020, nearly 400,000 transfers till now, the latest public audit reports are provided by PeckShield.\\n\\n**xLON Counterparty Risk: B**\\n\\nLON is non-custodial and open source, with around 50,000 holders, hence presents low centralisation risk.\\n\\n**xLON Market Risk: C+**\\n\\nSince the launch of LON, the price has experienced a surge. Due to the downturn of the entire crypto market, it has now fallen back. With the smooth operation of the xLON mechanism, its price gradually stabilized.\\n\\nCompared with its lower market capitalization, LON has good liquidity in both CEX and DEX, which is very important, which will help it to be recognized and held by a wider range of users in the future.\\n\\n**xLON Market** **Overall Rating: B-**\\n\\n## Risk Parameters\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*TN3r2DfHC0w_Mt9uHB6tbw.png)\\n\\n## Borrow&Deposit Rate Curves\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*2ijvAS3thrXOn1-2.png)\\n\\n## Mining Pool Adjustment\\n\\nAccording to the deposit/borrow incentive factor: 4/6, so the BorrowPool weight is 9600.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*42hDPbUbeeHFY0cBmBzNhw.png)\\n\\nThe weight for each asset in BorrowPool as follow:\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*qDKeXDHzX6ducZtQB2IW9A.png)\\n\\n## Introduction of xLON Deposit/Borrowing Mining Process\\n\\n## **Deposit Mining Process:**\\n\\n1\\\\.
