"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Non-Fungible Memory Tokens \\n[NFMTs]\\n\\nMemories. What do they reveal about you? What do they remind you of? A forgotten time? The nostalgia of an experience since passed? \\n\\nAs combed through the various voice recordings on my iPhone, I found a selection of memories from a secret party in Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan that I attended. I didn't immediately think to make them into NFTs. It wasn't until I had gone through the motions on Zora that the audio looped over and over that it clicked. This was the perfect experiment in documenting, sharing, and collecting memories.\\n\\nWhat could I reveal to the listener? Could they learn about me? And because we had all been deprived of events, could these moments hold a deeper meaning to the fleeting nature of socialization? Did we take for granted the ever innocuous social gathering? I'm not entirely sure. But these are questions that have continued to come into view the longer I've sat with those voice notes.\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/178)\\n\\n \\n\\nJust close your eyes, think of yourself either as the observer of the scene, or part of the scene, and let your mind paint the picture of the environment. Imagine where the DJ is, where the characters are, what type of house are you in? The first of three notes in this trilogy called ***[\\\"Shīkurettopātī: One Night In Kurosakimachi\\\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/178)***, it's very serendipitous that my phone picked up both a conversation I'm having about crate-digging at one of the only remaining Tower Record stores in the world AND some amazing house music. The instrumentation starts to swell with a soulful synth as the conversation reaches a euphoric note as we make the resolve to buy records and acknowledge how awesome the moment is.\\n\\nThe remaining two notes, ***[\\\"Not Now, But In The Future\\\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/189)*** and ***[\\\"Chinese Omelette OST\\\"](https://zora.co/sirsu/188)*** create this unintended effect of feeling like a short film + soundtrack with your own visual dreamscape constructing a memory that’s unique to you despite the fact that the audio is not your lived experience.\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/189)\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/188)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Spatial Conversations\\n\\nIn the context of memories, archived works in many ways achieve a similar effect of nostalgia. While they may not draw specifically from real life as a form of `reporting-lived-experience-as-documentation`, works that pull on the thread of life can be memory-inducing. For me, one of those works is a live recording in 2014 of a freeform DJ set with my uni-mates after a day of getting unbelievably stoned called \\\"SYNESTHESIA\\\". \\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nI'd be super curious to see what YOU see, more so than my own recollection of the space and the folks within it.\\n\\n\\n\\n//\\n\\nTweets to include\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/Aidan_Wolf/status/1355397771076005889?s=20\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/numomoart/status/1355563659385163776?s=20\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/enaraxr/status/1355450773212172290?s=20\",\"timestamp\":1621154022,\"title\":\"In Vitro Nostalgia: Minting Memories\",\"publication\":\"sirsu\"},\"digest\":\"rwqu5Mi8e2LhSj7OcdGCA9yo1yU7yOZ2g2xs8Tmb_vA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UCaADZyqyJ8_PGekrdtpblM9Z5LOI1YS3h0uO717pgM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vgpeMt9vdrAMghfVLfguLoRc4FevN7FCYLa0EAHV2ao\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qPKvalPAtYnqtnxLG7moyM-XDOIpqzSApfBA-l-_0SeY5ewWEabxCny4kcx6FtA4FVJHuNKLH13TOjrXopzQSQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc9fbcdd8d9ae02a683c0b0ec2999cdc6464866ee091af668f007ca510c982c68675fdb272bbe2f7784153053fff7f7e93a557c51e884236ba5be675e2f74da9b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on sirsu.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UCaADZyqyJ8_PGekrdtpblM9Z5LOI1YS3h0uO717pgM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vgpeMt9vdrAMghfVLfguLoRc4FevN7FCYLa0EAHV2ao\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kVKneiFoAnwbEVabds1Si7VqkeZPJbMXTDP31L34dKc\"}"
