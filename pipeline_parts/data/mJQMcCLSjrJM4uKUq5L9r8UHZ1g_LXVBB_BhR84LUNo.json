"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\\[footnote... The \\\"Partner\\\" here referred to, was my excellent friend Henry Garnett, Esq., of Wyre Side, near Lancaster.  He had been my sleeping partner or \\\"Co.\\\" for nearly twenty years, and the most perfect harmony always existed between us.  ...\\\\] that it was my intention to retire from business at the end of 1856. The necessary arrangements were accordingly made for carrying on the business after my retirement.  All was pleasantly and satisfactorily settled several months before I finally left; and the character and prosperity of the Bridgewater Foundry have been continued to the present day.\\n\\nBut where was I to turn to for a settled home?  Many years before I had seen a charming picture by my brother Patrick of \\\"A Cottage in Kent\\\" It took such a hold of my memory and imagination that I never ceased to entertain the longing and ambition to possess such a cottage as a cosy place of refuge for the rest of my life. Accordingly, about six months before my final retirement, I accompanied my wife in a visit to the south.  In the first place we made a careful selection from the advertisements in the Times of \\\"desirable residences\\\" in Kent. One in particular appeared very tempting.  We set out to view it. It seemed to embody all the conditions that we had pictured in our imagination as necessary to fulfil the idea of our \\\"Cottage in Kent.\\\" It had been the property of F. R. Lee, the Royal Academician. With a few alterations and additions it would entirely answer our purpose.  So we bought the property.\\n\\nI may mention that when I retired from business, and took out of it the fortune that had accumulated during my twenty-two years of assiduous attention and labour, I invested the bulk of it in Three per cent Consols.  The rate of interest was not high, but it was nevertheless secure.  High interest, as every one knows, means riskful security. I desired to have no anxiety about the source of my income, such as might hinder my enjoying the rest of my days in the active leisure which I desired.  I had for some time before my retirement been investing in consols, which my dear wife termed \\\"the true antibilious stock,\\\" and I have ever since had good reason to be satisfied with that safe and tranquillising investment.  All who value the health-conserving influence of the absence of financial worry will agree with me that this antibilious stock is about the best.\\n\\nThe \\\"Cottage in Kent\\\" was beautiful, especially in its rural surroundings.  The view from it was charming, and embodied all the attractive elements of happy-looking English scenery.  The noble old forest trees of Penshurst Park were close alongside, and the grand old historic mansion of Penshurst Place was within a quarter of a mile's distance from our house.  There were many other beautiful parks and country residences in our neighbourhood; the railway station, which was within thirty-five minutes' pleasant walk, enabling us to be within reach of London, with its innumerable attractions, in little more than an hour and a quarter.  Six acres of garden-ground at first surrounded our cottage, but these were afterwards expanded to sixteen; and the whole was made beautiful by the planting of trees and shrubs over the grounds.  In all this my wife and myself took the greatest delight.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Hammerfield, Penshurst.\\n\\nFrom my hereditary regard for hammers--two broken hammer-shafts being the crest of our family for hundreds of years--I named the place Hammerfield; and so it remains to this day.   The improvements and additions to the house and the grounds were considerable.  A greenhouse was built, 120 feet long by 32 feet wide.  Roomy apartments were added to the house.  The trees and shrubs planted about the grounds were carefully selected.  The coniferae class were my special favourites. I arranged them so that their natural variety of tints should form the most pleasing contrasts.  In this respect I introduced the beech-tree with the happiest effect.  It is bright green in spring, and in the autumn it retains its beautiful ruddy-tinted leaves until the end of winter, when they are again replaced by the new growth.\\n\\nThe warm tint of the beech contrasts beautifully with the bright green of the coniferae, especially of the Lawsoniania and the Douglassi-- the latter being one of the finest accessions to our list of conifers. It is graceful in form, and perfectly hardy.  I also interspersed with these several birch-trees, whose slender and graceful habit of growth forms so fine a contrast to the dense foliage of the conifers. To thus paint, as it were, with trees, is a high source of pleasure in gardening.  Among my various enjoyments this has been about the greatest.\\n\\nDuring the time that the alterations and enlargements were in progress we rented a house for six months at Sydenham, close to the beautiful grounds of the Crystal Palace.  This was a most happy episode in our lives, for, besides the great attractions of the place, both inside and out, there were the admirable orchestral daily concerts, at which we were constant attendants.  We had the pleasure of listening to the noble compositions of the great masters of music, the perfectly trained band being led by Herr Manns, who throws so much of his fine natural taste and enthusiastic spirit into the productions as to give them every possible charm.\\n\\nFrom a very early period of my life I have derived the highest enjoyment from listening to music, especially to melody, which is to me the most pleasing form of composition.  When I have the opportunity of listening to such kind of music, it yields me enjoyment that transcends all others.  It suggests ideas, and brings vividly before the mind's eye scenes that move the imagination.  This is, to me, the highest order of excellence in musical composition.  I used long ago, and still continue, to whistle a bit, especially when engaged in some pleasant occupation.  I can draw from my mental repository a vast number of airs and certain bits of compositions that I had once heard.  I possess that important qualification for a musician--\\\"a good ear;\\\" and I always worked most successfully at a mechanical drawing when I was engaged in whistling some favourite air.  The dual occupation of the brain had always the best results in the quick development of the constructive faculty.  And even in circumstances where whistling is not allowed I can think airs, and enjoy them almost as much as when they are distinctly audible.  This power of the brain, I am fain to believe, indicates the natural existence of the true musical faculty.  But I had been so busy during the course of my life that I had never any opportunity of learning the practical use of any musical instrument. And here I must leave this interesting subject.\\n\\nSo soon as I was in due possession of my house, I had speedily transported thither all my art treasures--my telescopes, my home stock of tools, the instruments of my own construction, made from the very beginning of my career as a mechanic, and associated with the most interesting and active parts of my life.  I lovingly treasured them, and gave them an honoured place in the workshop which I added to my residence.  There they are now, and I often spend a busy and delightful hour in handling my tools.  It is curious how the mere sight of such objects brings back to the memory bygone incidents and recollections. Friends long dead seem to start up while looking at them.  You almost feel as if you could converse with the departed.  I do not know of anything so touchingly powerful in vividly bringing back the treasured incidents and memories of one's life as the sight of such humble objects.  Every one has, no doubt, a treasured store of such material records of a well-remembered portion of his past life. These strike, as it were, the keynote to thoughts that bring back in vivid form the most cherished remembrances of our lives.  On many occasions I have seen at sale rooms long treasured hoards of such objects thrown together in a heap as mere rubbish.  And yet these had been to some the sources of many pleasant thoughts and recollections, But the last final break-up has come, and the personal belongings of some departed kind heart are scattered far and wide.  These touching relics of a long life, which had almost become part of himself, are \\\"knocked down\\\" to the lowest class of bidders.  It is a sad sight to witness the uncared for dispersion of such objects--objects that had been lovingly stored up as the most valued of personal treasures. I could have wished that, as was the practice in remote antiquity, such touching relics were buried with the dead, as their most fitting repository.  Then they might have left some record, instead of being desecrated by the harpies who wait at sales for such \\\"job lots.\\\"\\n\\nBehold us, then, settled down at Hammerfield for life.  We had plenty to do.  My workshop was fully equipped.  My hobbies were there, and I could work them to my heart's content.  The walls of our various rooms were soon hung with pictures, and other works of art, suggestive of many pleasant associations of former days.  Our library book-case was crowded with old friends, in the shape of books that had been read and re-read many times, until they had become almost part of ourselves. Old Lancashire friends made their way to us when \\\"up in town,\\\" and expressed themselves delighted with our pleasant house and its beautiful surroundings.\\n\\nThe continuous planting of the shrubs and trees gave us great pleasure. Those already planted had grown luxuriantly, fed by the fertile soil and the pure air.  Indeed, in course of time they required the judicious use of the axe in order to allow the fittest to survive and grow at their own free will.  Trees contrive to manage their own affairs without the necessity of much labour or interference. The \\\"survival of the fittest\\\" prevails here as elsewhere.  It is always a pleasure to watch them.  There are many ordinary old-fashioned roadside flowering plants which I esteem for their vigorous beauty, and I enjoy seeing them assume the careless grace of Nature.\\n\\nThe greenhouse is also a source of pleasure, especially to my dear wife.  It is full of flowers of all kinds, of which she is devotedly fond.  They supply her with subjects for her brush or her needle. She both paints them and works them by her needle in beautiful forms and groups.  This is one of her many favourite hobbies.  All this is suitable to our fireside employments, and makes the days and the evenings pass pleasantly away.\\n\\nCHAPTER 21.  Active leisure.\\n\\nWhen James Watt retired from business towards the close of his useful and admirable life, he spoke to his friends of occupying himself with \\\"ingenious trifles,\\\" and of turning \\\"some of his idle thoughts\\\" upon the invention of an arithmetical machine and a machine for copying sculpture.  These and other useful works occupied his attention for many years.\\n\\nIt was the same with myself.  I had good health (which Watt had not) and abundant energy.  When I retired from business I was only forty-eight years old, which may be considered the prime of life. But I had plenty of hobbies, perhaps the chief of which was Astronomy. No sooner had I settled at Hammerfield than I had my telescopes brought out and mounted.  The fine clear skies with which we were favoured, furnished me with abundant opportunities for the use of my instruments. I began again my investigations on the Sun and the Moon, and made some original discoveries, of which more anon.\\n\\nEarly in the year 1858 I received a pressing invitation from the Council of the Edinburgh Philosophical Society to give a lecture before their members on the Structure of the Lunar Surface.  As the subject was a favourite one with me, and as I had continued my investigations and increased my store of drawings since I had last appeared before an Edinburgh audience, I cheerfully complied with their request. I accordingly gave my lecture before a crowded meeting in the Queen Street Lecture Hall.\\n\\nThe audience appeared to be so earnestly interested by the subject that I offered to appear before them on two successive evenings and give any viva voce explanations about the drawings which those present might desire.  This deviation from the formality of a regular lecture was attended with the happiest results.  Edinburgh always supplies a highly-intelligent audience, and the cleverest and brightest were ready with their questions.  I was thus enabled to elucidate the lecture and to expand many of the most interesting points connected with the moon's surface, such as might formerly have appeared obscure.  These questioning lectures gave the highest satisfaction.  They satisfied myself as well as the audience, who went away filled with the most graphic information I could give them on the subject.\\n\\nBut not the least interesting part of my visit to Edinburgh on this occasion was the renewed intercourse which I enjoyed with many of my old friends.  Among these were my venerable friend Professor Pillans, Charles Maclaren (editor of the Scotsman), and Robert Chambers. We had a long  dander together through the Old Town, our talk being in broad Scotch.  Pillans was one of the fine old Edinburgh Liberals, who stuck to his principles through good report and through evil. In his position as Rector of the High School, he had given rare evidence of his excellence as a classical scholar.  He was afterwards promoted to be a Professor in the University.  He had as his pupils some of the most excellent men of my time.  Amongst his intimate friends were Sydney Smith, Brougham, Jeffrey, Cockburn--men who gave so special a character to the Edinburgh society of that time.\\n\\nWe had a delightful stroll through some of the most remarkable parts of the Old Town, with Robert Chambers as our guide.  We next mounted Arthur's Seat to observe some of the manifestations of volcanic action, which had given such a remarkable structure to the mountain. On this subject, Charles Maclaren was one of the best living expounders. He was an admirable geologist, and had closely observed the features of volcanic action round his native city.  Robert Chambers then took us to see the glacial grooved rocks on another part of the mountain. On this subject he was a master.  It was a vast treat to me to see those distinct evidences of actions so remotely separated in point of geological time--in respect to which even a million of years is a humble approximate unit\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... \\\"It is to our ever-dropping climate, with its hundred and fifty-two days of annual rain, that we owe our vegetable mould with its rich and beauteous mantle of sward and foliage.  And next, stripping from off the landscape its sands and gravels, we see its underlying boulder-clays, dingy and gray, and here presenting their vast ice-borne stones, and there its iceberg pavements.  And these clays in turn stripped away, the bare rocks appear, various in colour and uneven in surface, but everywhere grooved and polished, from the sea level and beneath it, to the height of more than a thousand feet, by evidently the same agent that careered along the pavements and transported the great stones.\\n\\nHUGH MILLER'S Geological Features of Edinburgh and its Neighbourhood.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nWhat a fine subject for a picture the group would have made! with the great volcanic summit of the mountain behind, the noble romantic city in the near distance, and the animated intelligent countenaces of the demonstrators, with the venerable Pillans eagerly listening--for the Professor was then in his eighty-eighth year.  I had the happiness of receiving a visit from him at Hammerfield in the following year. He was still hale and active; and although I was comparatively a boy to him, he was as bright and clear-headed as he had been forty years before.\\n\\nIn the course of the same year I accompanied my wife and my sister Charlotte on a visit to the Continent.  It was their first sojourn in foreign parts.  I was able, in some respects, to act as their guide. Our visit to Paris was most agreeable.  During the three weeks we were there, we visited the Louvre, the Luxembourg, Versailles, and the parts round about.  We made many visits to the Hotel Cluny, and inspected its most interesting contents, as well as the Roman baths and that part of the building devoted to Roman antiquities.  We were especially delighted with the apartments of the Archbishop of Paris, now hung with fine old tapestry and provided with authentic specimens of mediaeval furniture.  The quaint old cabinets were beautiful studies; and many artists were at work painting them in oil. Everything was in harmony. When the sun shone in through the windows in long beams of coloured light, illuminating portions of the antique furniture, the pictures were perfect.  We were much interested also by the chapel in which Mary Queen of Scots was married to the Dauphin. It is still in complete preservation.  The Gothic details of the chapel are quite a study; and the whole of these and the contents of this interesting Museum form a school of art of the best kind.\\n\\nFrom Paris we paid a visit to Chartres, which contains one of the most magnificent cathedrals in France.  Its dimensions are vast, its proportions are elegant, and its painted glass is unequalled. Nothing can be more beautiful than its three rose-windows.  But I am not writing a guide-book, and I must forbear.  After a few days more at Paris we proceeded south, and visited Lyons, Avignon, and Nismes, on our way to Marseilles.  I have already described Nismes in my previous visit to France.  I revisited the Roman amphitheatre, the Maison Quarree, that perfect Roman temple, which, standing as it does in an open square, is seen to full advantage.  We also went to see the magnificent Roman aqueduct at Pont du Gard.  The sight of the noble structure well repays a visit.  It consists of three tiers of arches.  Its magnitude, the skilful fitting of its enormous blocks, makes a powerful impression on the mind.  It has stood there, in that solitary wooded valley, for upwards of sixteen centuries; and it is still as well fitted for conveying its aqueduct of water as ever.  I have seen nothing to compare with it, even at Rome.  It throws all our architectural buildings into the shade.  On our way back from Marseilles to Paris we visited Grenoble and its surrounding beautiful Alpine scenery. Then to Chambery, and afterwards to Chamounix, where we obtained a splendid view of Mont Blanc.  We returned home by way of Geneva and Paris, vastly delighted with our most enjoyable journey.\\n\\nI return to another of my hobbies.  I had an earnest desire to acquire the art and mystery of practical photography.  I bought the necessary apparatus, together with the chemicals; and before long I became an expert in the use of the positive and negative collodion process, including the printing from negatives, in all the details of that wonderful and delightful art.  To any one who has some artistic taste, photography, both in its interesting processes and glorious results, becomes a most attractive and almost engrossing pursuit.  It is a delightful means of educating the eye for artistic feeling, as well as of educating the hands in delicate manipulation.  I know of nothing equal to photography as a means of advancing one's knowledge in these respects.  I had long meditated a work \\\"On the Moon,\\\" and it was for this purpose more especially that I was earnest in endeavouring to acquire the necessary practical skill.  I was soon enabled to obtain photographic copies of the elaborate models of parts of the moon's, surface, which I had long before prepared.  These copies were hailed by the highest authorities in this special department of astronomical research as the best examples of the moon's surface which had yet been produced.\\n\\nIn reference to this subject, as well as to my researches into the structure of the sun's surface, I had the inestimable happiness of securing the friendship of that noble philosopher, Sir John Herschel. His visits to me, and my visits to him, have left in my memory the most cherished and happy recollections.  Of all the scientific men I have had the happiness of meeting, Sir John stands supremely at the head of the list.  He combined profound knowledge with perfect humility. He was simple, earnest, and companionable, He was entirely free from assumptions of superiority, and, still learning, would listen attentively to the humblest student.  He was ready to counsel and instruct, as well as to receive information.  He would sit down in my workshop, and see me go through the various technical processes of casting, grinding, and polishing specula for reflecting telescopes. That was a pleasure to him, and a vast treat to me.\\n\\nI had been busily occupied for some time in making careful investigations into the dark spots upon the Sun's surface.  These spots are of extraordinary dimensions, sometimes more than 10,000 miles in diameter. Our world might be dropped into them.  I observed that the spots were sometimes bridged over by a streak of light, formed of willow-leaf-shaped objects.  They were apparently possessed of voluntary motion, and moved from one side of the spot to the other. These flakes were evidently the immediate sources of the solar light and heat.  I wrote a paper on the subject, which I sent to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester.\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester, 3d series, vol. i. p. 407.  My first discovery of the \\\"Willow-leaf\\\" objects on the Sun's surface was made in June 1860.I afterwards obtained several glimpses of them from time to time.But the occasions are very rare when the bright sun can be seen in a tranquil atmosphere free from vibrations, and when the delicate objects on its surface can be clearly defined.  It was not until the 5th of June 1864 that I obtained the finest sight of the Sun's spots and the Willow-leaf objects; it was then that I made a careful drawing of them, from which the annexed faithful engraving has been produced.  Indeed I never had a better sight of this extraordinary aspect of the Sun than on that day.  ...\\\\]\\n\\nThe results of my observations were of so novel a character that astronomers for some time hesitated to accept them as facts. Yet Sir John Herschel, the chief of astronomers, declared them to be \\\"a most wonderful discovery\\\"\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  Group of sun spots as seen by James Nasmyth, 5th June 1864.\\n\\nI received a letter from Sir John, dated Collingwood, 2lst of May 1861, in which he said:\\n\\n\\\"I am very much obliged to you for your note, and by the sight of your drawings, which Mr. Maclaren was so kind as to bring over here the other day.  I suppose there can be no doubt as to the reality of the willow-leaved flakes, and in that case they certainly are the most marvellous phenomena that have yet turned up--had almost said in all Nature--certainly in all Astronomy.\\n\\n\\\"What can they be?  Are they huge phosphorised fishes?  If so, what monsters!  Or are they crystals? a kind of igneous snow-flakes? floating in a fluid of their own, or very nearly their own, specific gravity?  Some kind of solidity or coherence they must have, or they would not retain their shape in the violent movements of the atmosphere which the change of the spots indicate.\\n\\n\\\"I observe that in the bridges all their axes have an approximate parallelism, and that in the penumbra they are dispersed, radiating from the inside and the outside of the spot, giving rise to that striated appearance which is familiar to all observers of the spots.\\n\\n\\\"I am very glad that you have pitched your tent in this part of the world, and I only wish it were a little nearer.  You will anyhow have the advantage at Penshurst of a much clearer atmosphere than in the north; but here, nearer the coast, I think we are still better off. \\\"Mr. Maclaren holds out the prospect of our meeting you at Pachley at no distant period, and I hope you will find your way ere long to Collingwood.  I have no instruments or astronomical apparatus to show you, but a remarkably pretty country, which is beginning to put on (rather late) its gala dress of spring?'\\n\\nSir John afterwards requested my permission to insert in his Outlines of Astronomy, of which a new edition was about to appear, a representation of \\\"the willow-leaved structure of the Sun's surface,\\\" --which had been published in the Manchester transactions,--to which I gladly gave my assent.  Sir John thus expresses himself on the subject: --\\\"The curious appearance of the 'pores' of the Sun's surface has lately received a most singular and unexpected interpretation from the remarkable discovery of Mr. J. Nasmyth, who, from a series of observations made with a reflecting telescope of his own construction under very high magnifying powers, and under exceptional circumstances of tranquillity and definition, has come to the conclusion that these pores are the polygonal interstices between certain luminous objects of an exceedingly definite shape and general uniformity of size, whose form (at least as seen in projection in the central portions of the disc) is that of the oblong leaves of a willow tree.  These cover the whole disc of the Sun (except in the space occupied by spots) in countless millions, and lie crossing each other in every imaginable direction....  This most astonishing revelation has been confirmed to a certain considerable extent, and with some modifications as to the form of the objects, their exact uniformity of size and resemblance of figure, by Messrs.  De la Rue, Pritchard and Stone in England, and M. Secchi in Rome.\\\"\\n\\nOn the 25th of February 1864, I received a communication from Mr. E. J. Stone, first assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.\\n\\nThe Astronomer-Royal, he said, \\\"has placed in my hands your letter of February 20.  Your discovery of the 'willow leaves' on the Solar photosphere having been brought forward at one of the late meetings of the Royal Astronomical Society, my attention was attracted to the subject.  At my request, the Astronomer-Royal ordered of Mr. J. Simms a reflecting eye-piece for our great equatorial.  The eye-piece was completed about the end of January last, and at the first good opportunity I turned the telescope on the Sun.\\n\\n\\\"I may state that my impression was, and it appears to have been the impression of several of the assistants here, that the willow leaves stand out dark against the luminous photosphere.  On looking at the Sun, I was at once struck with the apparent resolvability of its mottled appearance.  The whole disc of the Sun, so far as I examined it, appeared to be covered over with relatively bright rice-like particles, and the mottled appearance seemed to be produced by the interlacing of these particles.\\n\\n\\\"I could not observe any particular arrangement of the particles, but they appeared to be more numerous in some parts than in others. I have used the word 'rice-like' merely to convey a rough impression of their form.  I have seen them on two occasions since, but not so well as on the first day, when the definition was exceedingly good.\\n\\n\\\"on the first day that I saw them I called Mr Dunkin's attention to them.  He appears to have seen them.  He says, however, that he should not have noticed them if his attention had not been called to them.\\\"\\n\\nThe Astronomer Royal, in his report to the Admiralty on my discovery, said:\\n\\n\\\"an examination of the Sun's surface with the South-East Equatorial, under favourable circumstances, has convinced me of the accuracy of the description, which compares it with interlacing willow leaves or rice grains.\\\"\\n\\nIn March 1864 I received a letter from my friend De la Rue, dated from his observatory at Cranford, Middlesex, in which he said:  \\\"I like good honest doubting.  Before I had seen with my own eyes your willow leaves, I doubted their real existence, but I did not doubt your having seen what you had drawn.  But when I actually saw them for the first time, I could not restrain the exclamation, ' Why, here are Nasmyth's willow leaves! ' It requires a very fine state of the atmosphere to permit of their being seen, as I have seen them on three or four occasions, when their substantial reality can no longer be doubted.\\\"\\\\*  \\\\[footnote... Let me give another letter from my friend, dated the Observatory, Cranford, Middlesex, October 26, 1864.  He said:- \\\"I am quite pleased to learn that you like the large photograph. The first given to my friend was destined for and sent to you. No one has so great a claim on the fruit of my labours; for you inoculated me with the love of star-gazing, and gave me invaluable aid and advice in figuring specula.  I daresay you may remember the first occasion on which I saw a reflecting telescope, which was then being tried on the sun in a pattern loft at Patricroft.  You may also recall the volumes you wrote in answer to my troublesome questions. Yours very sincerely WARREN DE LA RUE.\\\"  ...\\\\]\\n\\nSir John Herschel confirmed this information in a letter which I received from him in the following May.  He said \\\"that Mr. De la Rue and a foreign gentleman, Hugo Muller, had been very successful in seeing and delineating the 'willow leaves' They are represented by Mr. M. as packed together on the edge of a spot, and appear rather like a bunch of bristles or thorns.  In other respects the individual forms agree very well with your delineations.\\\"  Another observer had discovered a marvellous resemblance between the solar spots and the hollows left by the breaking and subsidence of bubbles, which rise when oil varnish, which has moisture in it, is boiled, and the streaky channels are left by the retiring liquid.  \\\"I cannot help,\\\" adds Sir John, \\\"fancying a bare possibility of some upward outbreak, followed by a retreat of some gaseous matter, or some dilated portion of the general atmosphere struggling upwards, and at the same time expanding outwards.  I can conceive of an up-surge of some highly compressed matter, which relieved of pressure, will dilate laterally and upwards to an enormous extent (as Poullett Scrope supposes of his lavas full of compressed gases and steam), producing the spots, and, in that case, the furrows might equally well arise in the origination as in the closing in of a spot.\\\"\\n\\nI had the honour and happiness of receiving a visit from Sir John Herschel at my house at Hammerfield in the summer of 1864. He was accompanied by his daughter.  They spent several days with us. The weather was most enjoyable.  I had much conversation with Sir John as to the Sun spots and willow-leaf-shaped objects on the Sun's surface, as well as about my drawings of the Moon.  I exhibited to him my apparatus for obtaining sound castings of specula for reflecting telescopes.  I compounded the alloy, melted it, and cast a 10-inch speculum on my peculiar common-sense system.  I introduced the molten alloy, chilled it in a metal mould, by which every chance of flaws and imperfections is obviated.  I also showed him the action and results of my machine, by which I obtained the most exquisite polish and figure for the speculum.  Sir John was in the highest degree cognisant of the importance of these details, as contributing to the final excellent result.  It was therefore with great pleasure that I could exhibit these practical details before so competent a judge.\",\"timestamp\":1639290736,\"title\":\"\\nYet we had to tear ourselves away from this abode of peace and happiness.
