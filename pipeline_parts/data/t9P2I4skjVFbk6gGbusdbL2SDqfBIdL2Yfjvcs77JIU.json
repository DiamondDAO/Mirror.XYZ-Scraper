The two parties will jointly explore the possibilities of technology integrations, and work together to build a secure DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\nBlockchains generate massive amounts of data that is disconnected from the rest of the world. Processing that data and connecting it to centralized apps and legacy systems is time-consuming and cumbersome.\\n\\nPARSIQ makes it easy to monitor on-chain data in real time and create automated workflows for off-chain apps and devices.\\n\\nPARSIQ’s Smart Triggers extend the functionality of smart contracts into the real world. They are automated workflows that push on-chain data to web services and applications to trigger off-chain actions.\\n\\nSmart Triggers are blockchain agnostic. Supported networks include Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Solana, Binance Smart Chain, Algorand and others.\\n\\nWePiggy focuses on building an open-source, non-custodial crypto-asset lending market protocol that helps users realize asset appreciation and maximize utilization across many blockchain networks. On the premise of giving priority to funding security, WePiggy actively creates a more diverse lending market, optimizes the execution efficiency of smart contracts, and expands more dimensions of the business logic. Under the WePiggy multi-chain deployment plan, WePiggy is covering Ethereum, OKExChain, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Huobi Eco Chain, and innovative public and Layer-2 networks.\\n\\n## WePiggy + PARSIQ\\n\\nPARSIQ’s real-time data streaming technology can be integrated into WePiggy lending application, and this will help WePiggy enhance its data analysis capabilities, as well as the current notification system, to maintain the security of the protocol from many aspects.\\n\\nThe core development team will also, at the appropriate time, propose to list PRQ through a community proposal. This will help connect the WePiggy community to the PARSIQ community and allow PRQ to better integrate into the DeFi ecosystem.\\n\\n*“PARSIQ is an excellent data and automation platform that connects blockchain activity to real-world applications. The integration will allow us to provide the community users with a safe and reliable user experience.”*\\n\\n– Ron, Zheng, Founder and CEO of WePiggy\\n\\n*“The cross chain lending space is growing rapidly and WePiggy is being positioned solidly to compete in the space, and we are thrilled to be supplying the additional underlying technology to provide better services for their clients.”*\\n\\n– Tom Tirman, Founder and CEO of PARSIQ\\n\\n## About WePiggy\\n\\nWePiggy is an open-source, non-custodial, crypto asset lending market protocol. In WePiggy’s market, users can deposit their crypto assets to earn interest, or borrow other crypto assets by paying interest. WePiggy aims to spread the benefits of cryptocurrency’s freedom and transparency to the widest possible user community in a more friendly and simple way, as well as be a good partner for them in wealth management.\\n\\n**[Website](https://wepiggy.com/)**\\\\*\\\\* | **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/wepiggydotcom)** | **[Medium](https://wepiggy-com.medium.com/)** | **[Forum](https://gov.wepiggy.com/)** | **[Discord](https://discord.gg/pew9k58)** | **[Github](https://github.com/WePiggy)** | \\\\*\\\\***[Telegram](https://t.me/wepiggy)**\\n\\n## About PARSIQ\\n\\nPARSIQ is a blockchain monitoring and workflow automation platform that serves as a multi-level bridge between blockchains and off-chain applications.
