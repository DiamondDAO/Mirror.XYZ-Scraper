Therefore, a good fighter mobilizes the enemy but is never mobilized by the enemy. Being able to mobilize the enemy to automatically come to the battlefield that I envisioned is to lure me with benefits; to prevent the enemy from coming to the battlefield first, it is the result of setting up obstacles and obstructing it from all sides. Therefore, if the enemy is at ease in the army, he can be tired; if the enemy has enough food, he can be deprived; if the enemy is still, he can be forced to act. Marching through areas undefended by the enemy, attacking at a time the enemy does not expect, at a place the enemy does not expect. Marching thousands of miles without getting tired is because walking in an area where the enemy has no resistance or is unable to resist, it is like entering a no-man's land. If I attack, I will definitely win, because I am attacking where the enemy has neglected to defend. My defense must be solid because I hold the place where the enemy will definitely attack. Therefore, those who are good at offense can make the enemy do not know where to defend or how to defend. And those who are good at defense make the enemy do not know where to attack or how to attack. Profound and subtle, there is not even a trace of it; miraculous, mysterious, there is not even a little bit of information leaked. So it can become the master of the enemy's fate.\\n\\nWhen attacking, the enemy cannot resist, it is attacking the place where the enemy's troops are empty; when retreating, the enemy cannot pursue, it is fast and the enemy cannot catch up. Therefore, our army wants to fight, even if the enemy builds a high wall and digs a deep trench, he has to come out to fight our army, because our army has attacked the vital point where it must be rescued; our army does not want to fight with the enemy army, although it is only in the I drew a boundary on the ground for defense, and the enemy could not engage our army, because I had managed to change the direction of the enemy's attack. Therefore, make the enemy's army exposed and our army in a concealed state, so that our army can be concentrated and the enemy's army has to be dispersed. (If the total strength of the enemy and ours is equal), if I concentrate my troops on one point, and the enemy is scattered in ten places, I will be ten to one. In this way, (on local battlefields) there will be a situation where we are outnumbered by the enemy. In this situation, our army and the fighters will use less force and succeed more. If the enemy doesn't know where our army's planned battlefield is, it will take precautions everywhere. The more places we can take precautions, the fewer enemy troops can directly engage with our army at a specific location. Therefore, if guarding against the front, the troops behind will be insufficient, guarding against the rear, then the troops in the front will be insufficient, guarding against the left, then the troops on the right will be insufficient, guarding against the right, then the troops on the left will be insufficient, and guarding everywhere, then the troops will be insufficient in all places. . Insufficient troops are all due to division of troops to defend against the enemy; sufficient troops are due to forcing the enemy to divide up to defend me. Therefore, by predicting the location and time of the battle with the enemy, even if you travel thousands of miles, you can still fight the enemy. If you can't predict the location of the battle with the enemy, nor the time of the battle, if you encounter the enemy in a hurry, the left army will not be able to save the right army, the right army will not be able to save the left army, the former army will not be able to save the latter army, and the latter army will not be able to save the former army, not to mention The distance is ten miles away, and the distance is several miles away. According to my analysis of the state of Wu, although the state of Yue had a large number of soldiers, how could it help his victory? Therefore, it is said that victory can be created. Although the enemy has a large number of soldiers, it can prevent the enemy from effectively participating in the battle.\\n\\nThrough careful analysis, we can judge the pros and cons of the enemy's combat plan; by provoking the enemy, we can understand the law of the enemy's activities; through \\\"showing the shape\\\", we can find out whether the terrain is beneficial to the enemy; through tentative attacks, we can find out the enemy's activities The strength of the deployment of troops. Therefore, when the method of showing the enemy is used extremely cleverly, there is no flaw at all. In such a situation, even the most hidden spy can't find out my truth, and the smart adversary can't think of a way to deal with me. Adopt a winning strategy according to the enemy's situation, even if it is placed in front of everyone, everyone will not understand. People know how I overcome the enemy and win, but they don't know how I use them to win. Therefore, the strategies and tactics for defeating the enemy are different every time, and should be used flexibly according to the enemy's situation.\\n\\nThe nature of soldiers is like water. When water flows, it avoids high places and flows to low places. The key to winning with soldiers is to avoid a well-fortified and powerful enemy and attack its weak links. to adopt a winning strategy. Therefore, there is no fixed situation in fighting with soldiers, just as flowing water has no fixed shape and direction. Those who can win according to the changes of the enemy's situation are called using soldiers like gods. The five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth mutually generate and restrain each other, and no one is always victorious; the four seasons have successively replaced each other, and no one is fixed. Everything is in a state of flux.\",\"timestamp\":1642490321,\"title\":\"《孙子兵法》之【始计第六】（THE ART OF WAR-Virtual Reality Sixth)\"},\"digest\":\"bCxGmERtxlks_3SFPFxj5E7yhBN3QFOA_5ps3mc5se4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xC22330943F8342F94Bef053c6547f88FA852510f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MLHeskExVSIKb3xG7dXqR4gnfeU2jDlVB-A50IoBW10\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"msNOQU_NFQITopZ-d7gWKJpUg3drvXb68W4bZVzMjZc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AG667KXUs-DWCCIwlVL4k9wpbChwtmBE47aAMSWIx1liS9XYkpqf4OHv-FjITK_SwixCbnvgD5CmpDORWW8t2Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6c02282da3a4482a21d06c4fc15cc4b21e3e7643f5b28cca57f3238ff1fe85d0562469aaf32e9099895ee2fe5e0e10ba6a50c556051ec77d27654b71867ddd591c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"MLHeskExVSIKb3xG7dXqR4gnfeU2jDlVB-A50IoBW10\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"msNOQU_NFQITopZ-d7gWKJpUg3drvXb68W4bZVzMjZc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bCxGmERtxlks_3SFPFxj5E7yhBN3QFOA_5ps3mc5se4\"}"
