As we approach our public sale, there‚Äôs probably no better time to inform our dear apricots üçë of all the details about how our retro airdrop works.\\n\\nSo here we go üöÄ\\n\\n## Reward Rates üìà\\n\\nWe are giving out **1% of APT‚Äôs total token supply** as retroactive airdrop for users who** **have or will have **deposited, borrowed, and X-farmed **on Apricot** in the first 30 days since our launch on October, 19th**.\\n\\nYes, that means our retro program is **still ongoing** and will last for **another 10 days** or so!\\n\\nEvery second, approximately 3.858 APT tokens are emitted to our users. The rules of distribution are as follows:\\n\\n*   Deposit and borrow for **all tokens** are counted and considered\\n*   Each dollar value **deposited or borrowed** earns the **same rate** of base APT rewards\\n*   LP token deposits earn only the base APT rewards (1x)\\n*   SOL, mSOL, USDC, USDT earn **3x** the base rewards\\n*   Other tokens (USTw, BTC, ETH, RAY, ORCA) earn **2x** the base rewards\\n\\n<!---->\\n\\n    In short, your retro rewards =(LP tokens x1) + {(SOL + mSOL + USDC + USDT) x3} + {(USTw + BTC + ETH + RAY + ORCA) x2}\\n\\nIn case you are wondering, **when you use X-farm,** you are actually creating LP token deposits into your Apricot account, so those LP tokens do earn the 1x deposit rewards. And if you have** borrowed tokens to start X-farming**, yes those borrows earn you rewards according to the rules above.\\n\\nAs an example, let‚Äôs take a look at the following account with approximately $1000 deposit position in USDC and $500 borrow position in BTC\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*RjJkoX_wqyOLelvl)\\n\\nAssuming the weekly rate for USDC deposit is 3.1 APT / $1000, and the weekly rate for BTC borrow is 2.1 APT / $1000, then the weekly APT reward this account will receive is simply\\n\\n    $1000 / $1000 * 3.1 + $500 / $1000 * 2.1 = 4.15 APT\\n\\nIf this account has another $1000 in any LP tokens, which earns one-third the weekly reward rate of USDC or half of the weekly reward of BTC (approximately 1 APT / $1000 per week in this example), then this account will earn another 1 APT per week.\\n\\n## Distribution üéÅ\\n\\nOnce the 30-day period is up (right before our Token Generation Event), the exact amount of rewards you can claim will become visible from the Rewards tab.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*oIIYbdh5Qe3xHMFy)\\n\\nThe retro airdrop will be released over a period of 4 weeks after our Token Generation Event. Each week, 25% of the airdrop will be unlocked and made available for users to claim.\\n\\n## What Happens After Retro ‚ÅâÔ∏è üëÄ\\n\\nOnce the 30-day period ends, we will **activate our liquidity mining program**. It will likely retain a similar structure but differ in some reward details, so keep watching out on our Twitter, Discord, and Telegram for the latest updates!\\n\\nMore to come! Stay tuned üëã\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636531119,\"title\":\"Retroactive Liquidity Mining - APRICOT FINANCE - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"C42vfiopVoCRrJW6c7jNmgzamkgq46Pflc5AfXMmuKQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6f3c06b4c50B17b4CEAA9d609356Ebd57963D011\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uFMHOmlLDPrLDf9Y_vji2G6pgcEUBHQzfdRtjqGd2JE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dHwc_COyYZZnt4xLgaCrcVEjVQ4Avm85TwanmeOBhaE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VLH5ec86Psrh_1l0NwZwGfhuZJ0FeW2ayvnD2C8NMycFmCW8JEK41bFNuml560mqafX3BMkvk_R6zsmHt3026g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7259903fd172e0c05c42676beae37b4da6382e537fae4d8102dceaccc213701f73d4978d59e3e00a628452d62720f35e6d8629cc60dbb41a34211bb67edfc62d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uFMHOmlLDPrLDf9Y_vji2G6pgcEUBHQzfdRtjqGd2JE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dHwc_COyYZZnt4xLgaCrcVEjVQ4Avm85TwanmeOBhaE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"C42vfiopVoCRrJW6c7jNmgzamkgq46Pflc5AfXMmuKQ\"}"
