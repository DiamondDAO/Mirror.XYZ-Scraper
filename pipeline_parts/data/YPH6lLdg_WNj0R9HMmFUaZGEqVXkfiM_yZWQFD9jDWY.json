"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello everyone,\\n\\nWriting entries like this isn’t something I normally do but with things moving as fast as they are, this feels like a good place and time to start.\\n\\n## MetaBirkins\\n\\nThe [MetaBirkins community](https://discord.gg/DtqrXFPPUw) has been growing by the hundreds daily and I can’t be more thankful for all of your support. I minted the, one-of-one, [Baby Birkin](https://basic.space/auctions/baby-birkin) in May of this year with no expectations and now I’m sitting here making the final selections for the collection of one hundred. I began working on [MetaBirkins](https://metabirkins.com/) in response to [fashion’s latest “fur free” initiatives](https://www.kering.com/en/news/kering-goes-entirely-fur-free) and after catching a wave of positive reactions to a few sneak peeks on Instagram and Twitter, I knew I had to try and recreate the same exclusivity and demand of Hermes’ most famous handbag. My goal is for MetaBirkins double as an investment for holders like the real-world “holy grail” handbag. Baby Birkin sold for $23,500.00 at auction and received global publicity, a price and accomplishment I know MetaBirkins will eclipse in the hands of the right holders.\\n\\n## Beyond\\n\\nThe Baby Birkin and MetaBirkins have all led up to this. This month, I assembled a team of Web3 developers and partnered with, quite possibly the most talented human being I know, [Amber Park](https://www.instagram.com/amberpark/), to begin work on a large-scale generative project minting in Q1 of 2022. I can’t share too much information in these early stages of development but I will leave you with this: \\n  \\n • The first 1,000 MetaBirkins Discord server members will automatically be whitelisted for the generative project \\n • The top 10 longest MetaBirkins holders (at the time of the generative project minting) will be gifted an item from the generative project collection \\n  \\n And here’s a preview of the collection..\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WU97wmU1RgAaZUJsBFbc_.jpg?height=3000&width=5000)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637632554,\"title\":\"MetaBirkins and Beyond.\"},\"digest\":\"RXQsX7vBT0DIWcI6Vzz6m44-a7f0q_CjVpx6JFbTWE0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa061982D4B087D911Db8399a641187dF945D48D0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uBFSp-6TgRLthuqcm4yIDXDEOfXPGy_ZbkuUTlL3N6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rwcHHTBkGxv-ijfFuYZ4cevkTPJeojjT0H54XUVhwgM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CRRP3GdffYApN762ZDmtWMqVDpHtVi-cPOTV0X9xIgZ530yB-1H9Yd505Xx8-OlNz0UkQWGyHJ4JSjE7g96_2g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8338a55b8f4ab5db9567833912be57e547d178bc257cd79428c7fe982a5075e1754665397695ebc4eb06b91f668069c3710c8eb69049376e5a9deddbc75f1bbd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uBFSp-6TgRLthuqcm4yIDXDEOfXPGy_ZbkuUTlL3N6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rwcHHTBkGxv-ijfFuYZ4cevkTPJeojjT0H54XUVhwgM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wnu9INib4HflsLlITwzarSDtzOigfHHgdHepF3pjOQs\"}"
