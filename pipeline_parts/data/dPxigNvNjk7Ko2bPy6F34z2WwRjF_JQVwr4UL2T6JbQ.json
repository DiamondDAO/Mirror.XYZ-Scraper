"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"by Maggie; for the girl liked her mankind to do honor to Kenmuir on these occasions. So she brushed up Andrew, tied his scarf, saw his boots and hands were clean, and titivated him generally till she had converted the ungainly hobbledehoy into a thoroughly \\\"likely young mon.\\\"\\n\\nAnd all the while she was thinking of that other boy for whom on such gala days she had been wont to perform like offices. And her father, marking the tears in her eyes, and mindful of the squire's mysterious hint, said gently:\\n\\n\\\"Cheer up, lass. Happen I'll ha' news for you the night!\\\"\\n\\nThe girl nodded, and smiled wanly.\\n\\n\\\"Happen so, dad,\\\" she said. But in her heart she doubted.\\n\\nNevertheless it was with a cheerful countenance that, a little later, she stood in the door with wee Anne and Owd Bob and waved the travellers Godspeed; while the golden-haired lassie, fiercely gripping the old dog's tail with one hand and her sister with the other, screamed them a wordless farewell.\\n\\nThe sun had reached its highest when the two wayfarers passed through the gray portals of the Manor.\\n\\nIn the stately entrance hall, imposing with all the evidences of a long and honorable line, were gathered now the many tenants throughout the wide March Mere Estate. Weather-beaten, rent-paying sons of the soil; most of them native-born, many of them like James Moore, whose fathers had for generations owned and farmed the land they now leased at the hands of the Sylvesters there in the old hail they were assembled, a mighty host. And apart from the others, standing as though in irony beneath the frown of one of those steel-clad warriors who held the door, was little M'Adam, puny always, paltry now, mocking his manhood.\\n\\nThe door at the far end of the hail opened, and the squire entered, beaming on every one.\\n\\n\\\"Here you are--eh, eh! How are you all? Glad to see ye! Good-day, James! Good-day, Saunderson! Good-day to you all! Bringin' a friend with me--eh, eh!\\\" and he stood aside to let by his agent, Parson Leggy, and last of all, shy and blushing, a fair-haired young giant.\\n\\n\\\"If it bain't David!\\\" was the cry. \\\"Eh, lad, we's fain to see yo'! And yo'm lookin' stout, surely!\\\" And they thronged about the boy, shaking him by the hand, and asking him his story.\\n\\n'Twas but a simple tale. After his flight on the eventful night he had gone south, drover-- ing. He had written to Maggie, and been surprised and hurt to receive no reply. In vain he had waited, and too proud to write again, had remained ignorant of his father's recovery,, neither caring nor daring to return. Then by mere chance, he had met the squire at the York cattle-show; and that kind man, who knew his story, had eased his fears and obtained from him a promise to return as soon as the term of his engagement had expired. And there he was.\\n\\nThe Dalesmen gathered round the boy, listening to his tale, and in return telling him the home news, and chaffing him about Maggie.\\n\\nOf all the people present, only one seemed unmoved, and that was M'Adam. When first David had entered he had started forward, a flush of color warming his thin cheeks; but no one had noticed his emotion; and now, back again beneath his armor, he watched the scene, a sour smile playing about his lips.\\n\\n\\\"I think the lad might ha' the grace to come and say he's sorry for 'temptin' to murder me. Hooiver \\\"--with a characteristic shrug--\\\" I suppose I'm onraisonahie.\\\"\\n\\nThen the gong rang out its summons, and the squire led the way into the great dining-hail. At the one end of the long table, heavy with all the solid delicacies of such a feast, he took his seat with the Master of Kenmuir upon his right. At the other end was Parson Leggy. While down the sides the stalwart Dalesmen were arrayed, with M'Adam a little lost figure in the centre.\\n\\nAt first they talked but little, awed like chil.. dren: knives plied, glasses tinkled, the carvers had all their work, only the tongues were at rest. But the squire's ringing laugh and the parson's cheery tones soon put them at their ease; and a babel of voices rose and waxed.\\n\\nOf them all, only M'Adam sat silent. He talked to no man, and you may be sure no one talked to him. His hand crept of tener to his glass than plate, till the sallow face began to flush, and the dim eyes to grow unnaturally bright.\\n\\nToward the end of the meal there was loud tapping on the table, calls for silence, and men pushed back their chairs. The squire was on his feet to make his annual speech.\\n\\nHe started by telling them how glad he was to see them there. He made an allusion to Owd Bob and the Shepherds' Trophy which was heartily applauded. He touched on the Black Killer, and said he had a remedy to propose: that Th' Owd Un should he set upon the criminal's track--a suggestion which was received with enthusiasm, while M'Adam's cackling laugh could be heard high above the rest.\\n\\nFrom that he dwelt upon the existing condition of agriculture, the depression in which he attributed to the late Radical Government. He said that now with the Conservatives in office, and a ministry composed of \\\"honorable men and gentlemen,\\\" he felt convinced that things would brighten. The Radicals' one ambition was to set class against class, landlord against tenant. Well, during the last five hundred years, the Sylvesters had rarely been--he was sorry to have to confess it--good men (laughter and dissent); but he never yet heard of the Sylvester--though he shouldn't say it--\\\\~-who was a bad landlord (loud applause).\\n\\nThis was a free country, and any tenant of his who was not content (a voice, \\\"'Oo says we bain't? \\\")--\\\" thank you, thank you! \\\"--well, there was room for him outside. (Cheers.)\\n\\nHe thanked God from the bottom of his heart\\n\\nthat, during the forty years he had been responsible for the March Mere Estate, there had never been any friction between him and his people (cheers), and he didn't think there ever would be. (Loud cheers.)\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, thank you!\\\" And his motto was, \\\"Shun a Radical as you do the devil!\\\"-- and he was very glad to see them all there-- very glad; and he wished to give them a toast, \\\"The Queen! God bless her!\\\" and--wait a minute!--with her Majesty's name to couple --he was sure that gracious lady would wish it--that of \\\"Owd Bob o' Kenmuir!\\\" Then he sat down abruptly amid thundering applause.\\n\\nThe toasts duly honoured, James Moore, by prescriptive right as Master of Kenmuir, rose to answer.\\n\\nHe began by saying that he spoke \\\"as representing all the tenants, \\\"--but he was interrupted.\\n\\n\\\"Na,\\\" came a shrill voice from half-way down the table. \\\"Yell except me, James Moore. I'd as lief be represented by Judas!\\\"\\n\\nThere were cries of \\\"Hold ye gab, little mon!\\\" and the squire's voice, \\\"That'll do, Mr. M'Adam!\\\"\\n\\nThe little man restrained his tongue, but his eyes gleamed like a ferret's; and the Master continued his speech.\\n\\nHe spoke briefly and to the point, in short phrases. And all the while M'Adam kept up a low-voiced, running commentary. At length he could control himself no longer. Half rising from his chair, he leant forward with hot face and burning eyes, and cried: \\\"Sit doon, James Moore! Hoo daur ye stan' there like an honest man, ye whitewashed sepulchre? Sit doon, I say, or' '--threateningly--\\\" wad ye hae me come to ye?\\\"\\n\\nAt that the Dalesmen laughed uproariously, and even the Master's grim face relaxed. But the squire's voice rang out sharp and stern.\\n\\n\\\"Keep silence and sit down, Mr. M'Adam! D'you hear me, sir? If I have to speak to you again it will be to order you to leave the room.\\\"\\n\\nThe little man obeyed, sullen and vengeful, like a beaten cat.\\n\\nThe Master concluded his speech by calling on all present to give three cheers for the squire, her ladyship, and the young ladies.\\n\\nThe call was responded to enthusiastically, every man standing. Just as the noise was at its zenith, Lady Eleanour herself, with her two fair daughters, glided into the gallery at the end of the hall; whereat the cheering became deafening.\\n\\nSlowly the clamor subsided. One by one the tenants sat down. At length there was left standing only one solitary figure-- M 'Adam.\\n\\nHis face was set, and he gripped the chair in front of him with thin, nervous hands.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Sylvester,\\\" he began in low yet clear voice, \\\"ye said this is a free country and we're a' free men. And that hem' so, I'll tak' the liberty, wi' yer permission, to say a word. It's maybe the last time I'll be wi' ye, so I hope ye'll listen to me.\\\"\\n\\nThe Dalesmen looked surprised, and the squire uneasy. Nevertheless he nodded assent.\\n\\nThe little man straightened himself. His face was tense as though strung up to a high resolve. All the passion had fled from it, all the bitterness was gone; and left behind was a strange, enobling earnestness. Standing there in the silence of that great hail, with every eye upon him, he looked like some prisoner at the bar about to plead for his life.\\n\\n\\\"Gentlemen,\\\" he began, \\\"I've bin amang ye noo a score years, and I can truly say there's not a man in this room I can ca' 'Friend.' \\\" He looked along the ranks of upturned faces. \\\"Ay, David, I see ye, and you, Mr. Hornbut, and you, Mr. Sylvester--ilka one o' you, and not one as'd back me like a comrade gin a trouble came upon me.\\\" There was no rebuke in the grave little voice--it merely stated a hard fact.\\n\\n\\\"There's I doot no one amang ye but has some one--friend or blood--wham he can turn to when things are sair wi' him. I've no one.\\n\\n'I bear alane my lade o' care'--\\n\\nalane wi' Wullie, who stands to me, blaw or snaw, rain or shine. And whiles I'm feared he'll be took from me.\\\" He spoke this last half to himself, a grieved, puzzled expression on his face, as though lately he had dreamed some ill dream.\\n\\n\\\"Forbye Wuilie, I've no friend on God's earth. And, mind ye, a bad man aften mak's a good friend--but ye've never given me the chance. It's a sair thing that, gentlemen, to ha' to fight the battle o' life alane: no one to pat ye on th' back, no one to say 'Weel done.' It hardly gies a man a chance. For gin he does try and yet fails, men never mind the tryin', they only mark the failin'.\\n\\n\\\"I dinna blame ye. There'., somethin' bred in me, it se ms, as sets ivery one agin me. It's the same wi' Wullie and the tykes--they're doon on him same as men are on me. I suppose we was made so. Sin' I was a lad it's aye bin the same. From school days I've had ivery one agin me.\\n\\n\\\"In ma life I've had three fiends. Ma mither--and she went; then ma wife \\\"--he gave a great swallow--\\\" and she's awa'; and I may say they're the only two human hem's as ha' lived on God's earth in ma time that iver tried to bear wi' me; -- and Wullie. A man's mither--a man's wife-a man's dog! it's aften a' he has in this wand; and the more he prizes them the more like they are to be took from him.\\\" The little earnest voice shook, and the dim eyes puckered and filled.\\n\\n\\\"Sin' I've bin amang ye-twenty-odd years --can any man here mind speakin' any word that wasna ill to me?\\\" He paused; there was no reply.\\n\\n\\\"I'll tell ye. All the time I've lived here I've had one kindly word spoke to me, and that a fortnight gone, and not by a man then--by her ladyship, God bless her!\\\" He glanced up into the gallery. There was no one visible there; but a curtain at one end shook as though it were sobbing.\\n\\n\\\"Weel, I'm thinkin' we'll be gaein' in a wee while noo, Wullie and me, alane and thegither, as we've aye done. And it's time we went. Ye've had enough o' us, and it's no for me to blame ye. And when I'm gone what'll ye say o' me? 'He was a drunkard.' I am. 'He was a sinner.' I am. 'He was ilka thing he shouldna be.' I am. 'We're glad he's gone.' That's what ye'il say o' me. And it's but ma deserts.\\\"\\n\\nThe gentle, condemning voice ceased, and began again.\\n\\n\\\"That's what I am. Gin things had been differ', aiblins I'd ha' bin differ'. D'ye ken Robbie Burns? That's a man I've read, and ead, and read. D'ye ken why I love him as some o' you do yen Bibles? Because there's a humanity about him. A weak man hissel', aye slippin', slippin', slippin', and tryin' to haud up; sorrowin' ae minute, sinnin' the next; doin' ill deeds and wishin' 'em undone--just a plain human man, a sinner. And that's why I'm thinkin he's tender for us as is like him. He understood. It's what he wrote--after am o' his tumbles, I'm thinkin'--that I was goin' to tell ye:\\n\\n'Then gently scan yer brother man, Still gentler sister woman, Though they may gang a kennin' wrang,  To step aside is human'--\\n\\nthe doctrine o' Charity. Gie him his chance, says Robbie, though he be a sinner. Mony a mon'd be differ', mony bad'd be gude, gin they had but their chance. Gie 'em their chance, says he; and I'm wi' him. As 'tis, ye see me here--a bad man wi' still a streak o' good in him. Gin I'd had ma chance, aiblins 'twad be--a good man wi' just a spice o' the devil in him. A' the differ' betune what is and what might ha' bin.\\\"\\n\\nChapter XXVIII  THE DEVIL'S BOWL\\n\\nHE sat down. In the great hail there was silence, save for a tiny sound from the gallery like a sob suppressed.\\n\\nThe squire rose hurriedly and left the room. After him, one by one, trailed the tenants. At length, two only remained--M'Adam, sitting solitary with a long array of empty chairs on either hand; and, at the far end of the table, Parson Leggy, stern, upright, motionless.\\n\\nWhen the last man had left the room the parson rose, and with lips tight-set strode across the silent hail.\\n\\n\\\"M'Adam,\\\" he said rapidly and almost roughly, \\\"I've listened to what you've said, as I think we all have, with a sore heart. You hit hard--but I think you were right. And if I've not done my duty by you as I ought--and I fear I've not--it's now my duty as God's minister to be the first to say I'm sorry.\\\" And it was evident from his face what an effort the words cost him.\\n\\nThe little man tilted back his chair, and raised his head.\\n\\nIt was the old M'Adam who looked up. The thin lips were curled; a grin was crawling across the mocking face; and he wagged his head gently, as he looked at the speaker through the slits of his half-closed eyes.\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Hurnbert, I believe ye thocht me in earnest, 'deed and I do!\\\" He leaned back in his chair and laughed softly. \\\"Ye swallered it all down like best butter. Dear, dear! to think o' that!\\\" Then, stretching forward:\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Hornbut, I was playin' wi' ye.\\\"\\n\\nThe parson's face, as he listened, was ugly to watch. He shot out a hand and grabbed the scoffer by his coat; then dropped it again and turned abruptly away.\\n\\nAs he passed through the door a little sneering voice called after him:\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Hornbut, I ask ye hoo you, a minister o' the Church of England, can reconcile it to yer conscience to think--though it be but for a minute--that there can be ony good in a man and him no churchgoer? Sir, ye're a heretic--not to say a heathen!\\\" He sniggered to himself, and his hand crept to a half-emptied wine decanter.\\n\\nAn hour later, James Moore, his business with the squire completed, passed through the hail on his way out. Its only occupant was now M'Adam, and the Master walked straight up to his enemy.\\n\\n\\\"M'Adam,\\\" he said gruffly, holding out a sinewy hand, \\\"I'd like to say--\\\"\\n\\nThe little man knocked aside the token of friendship.\\n\\n\\\"Na, na. No cant, if ye please, James Moore. That'll aiblins go doon wi' the parsons, but not wi' me. I ken you and you ken me, and all the whitewash i' th' wand '11 no deceive us.\\\"\\n\\nThe Master turned away, and his face was hard as the nether millstone. But the little man pursued him.\\n\\nI was nigh forgettin',\\\" he said. \\\"I've a surprise for ye, James Moore. But I hear it's yer birthday on Sunday, and I'll keep it till then--he! he!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ye'il see me before Sunday, M'Adam,\\\" the other answered. \\\"On Saturday, as I told yo', I'm comin' to see if yo've done yer duty.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Whether ye come, James Moore, is your business. Whether ye'll iver go, once there, I'll mak' mine. I've warned ye twice noo and the little man laughed that harsh, cackling laugh of his.\\n\\nAt the door of the hall the Master met David. \\\"Noo, lad, yo're comin' along wi' Andrew and me,\\\" he said; \\\"Maggie'll niver forgie us if we dinna bring yo' home wi' us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you kindly, Mr. Moore,\\\" the boy replied. \\\"I've to see squire first; and then yo' may be sure I'll be after you.''\\n\\nThe Master faltered a moment.\\n\\n\\\"David, ha'n yo' spoke to yer father yet?\\\" he asked in low voice. \\\"Yo' should, lad.\\\"\\n\\nThe boy made a gesture of dissent.\\n\\n\\\"I canna,\\\" he said petulantly.\\n\\n\\\"I would, lad,\\\" the other advised. \\\"An' yo' don't yo' may be sorry after.\\\"\\n\\nAs he turned away he heard the boy's steps, dull and sodden, as he crossed the hall; and then a thin, would-be cordial voice in the emptiness:\\n\\n\\\"I declar' if 'tisna David! The return o' the Prodeegal--he! he! So ye've seen yer auld dad at last, and the last; the proper place, say ye, for yen father--he! he! Eh, lad, but I'm blithe to see ye. D'ye mind when we was last thegither? Ye was kneelin' on ma chest: 'Your time's come, dad,' says you, and wangs me o'er the face--he! he! I mind it as if 'twas yesterday. Weel, weel, we'll say nae mair about it. Boys will be boys. Sons will be sons. Accidents will happen. And if at first ye don't succeed, why, try, try again--he! he!\\\"\\n\\nDusk was merging into darkness when the Master and Andrew reached the Dalesman's Daughter. It had been long dark when they emerged from the cosy parlor of the inn and plunged out into the night.\\n\\nAs they crossed the Silver Lea and trudged over that familiar ground, where a fortnight since had been fought out the battle of the Cup, the wind fluttered past them in spasmodic gasps.\\n\\n\\\"There s trouble in the wind,\\\" said the Master.\\n\\n\\\"Ay,\\\" answered his laconic son.\\n\\nAll day there had been no breath of air, and the sky dangerously blue. But now a world of black was surging up from the horizon, smothering the star-lit night; and small dark clouds, like puffs of smoke, detaching themselves from the main body, were driving tempestuously forward--the vanguard of the storm.\\n\\nIn the distance was a low tumbling like heavy tumbrils on the floor of heaven. All about, the wind sounded hollow like a mighty scythe on corn. The air was oppressed with a leaden blackness--no glimmer of light on any hand; and as they began the ascent of the Pass they reached out blind hands to feel along the rock-face.\\n\\nA sea-fret, cool and wetting, fell. A few big rain-drops splashed heavily down. The wind rose with a leap and roared past them up the rocky track. And the water-gates of heaven were flung wide.\\n\\nWet and weary, they battled on; thinking sometimes of the cosy parlor behind; sometimes of the home in front; wondering whether Maggie, in flat contradiction of her father's orders, would be up to welcome them; or whether only Owd Bob would come out to meet lhem.\\n\\nThe wind volleyed past them like salvoes of artillery. The rain stormed at them from above; spat at them from the rock-face; and leapt up at them from their feet.\\n\\nOnce they halted for a moment, finding a miserable shelter in a crevice of the rock.\\n\\n\\\"It's a Black Killer's night,\\\" panted the Master. \\\"I reck'n he's oot.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ay,\\\" the boy gasped, \\\"reck'n he is.\\\" Up and up they climbed through the blackness, blind and buffeted. The eternal thunder of the rain was all about them; the clamor of the gale above; and far beneath, the roar of angry waters.\\n\\nOnce, in a lull in the storm, the Master turned and looked back into the blackness along the path they had come.\\n\\n\\\"Did ye hear onythin'?\\\" he roared above the muffled soughing of the wind.\\n\\n\\\"Nay!\\\" Andrew shouted back.\\n\\n\\\"I thowt I heard a step!\\\" the Master cried, peering down. But nothing could he see.\\n\\nThen the wind leaped to life again like a giant from his sleep, drowning all sound with its hurricane voice; and they turned and bent to their task again.\\n\\nNearing the summit, the Master turned once more.\\n\\n\\\"There it was again!\\\" he called; but his words were swept away on the storm; and they buckled to the struggle afresh.\\n\\nEver and anon the moon gleamed down through the riot of tossing sky. Then they could see the wet wall above them, with the water tumbling down its sheer face; and far below, in the roaring gutter of the Pass a brown-stained torrent. Hardly, however, had they time to glance around when a mass of cloud would hurry jealously up, and all again was blackness and noise.\\n\\nAt length, nigh spent, they topped the last and steepest pitch of the Pass, and emerged into the Devil's Bowl. There, overcome with their exertions, they flung themselves on to the soaking ground to draw breath.\\n\\nBehind them, the wind rushed with a sullen roar up the funnel of the Pass. It screamed above them as though ten million devils were a-horse; and blurted out on to the wild Marches beyond.\\n\\nAs they lay there, still panting, the moon gleamed down in momentary graciousness. In front, through the lashing rain, they could discern the hillocks that squat, hag-like, round the Devil's Bowl; and lying in its bosom, its white waters, usually so still, ploughed now into a thousand furrows, the Lone Tarn.\\n\\nThe Master raised his head and craned forward at the ghostly scene. Of a sudden he reared himself on to his arms, and stayed motionless awhile. Then he dropped as though dead, forcing down Andrew with an iron hand.\\n\\n\\\"Lad, did'st see?\\\" he whispered.\\n\\n\\\"Nay; what was't?\\\" the boy replied, roused by his father's tone.\\n\\n\\\"There!\\\"\\n\\nBut as the Master pointed forward, a blur of cloud intervened and all was dark. Quickly it passed; and again the lantern of the night shone down. And Andrew, looking with all his eyes, saw indeed.\\n\\nThere, in front, by the fretting waters of the Tarn, packed in a solid phalanx, with every head turned in the same direction, was a flock of sheep. They were motionless, all-intent, staring with horror-bulging eyes. A column of steam rose from their bodies into the rain-pierced air. Panting and palpitating, yet they stood with their backs to the water, as though determined to sell their lives dearly. Beyond them, not fifty yards away, crouched a humpbacked boulder, casting a long, misshapen shadow in the moonlight. And beneath it were two black objects, one still struggling feebly.\\n\\n\\\"The Killer!\\\" gasped the boy, and, all ablaze with excitement, began forging forward.\\n\\n\\\"Steady, lad, steady!\\\" urged his father, dropping a restraining hand on the boy's shoulder.\\n\\nAbove them a huddle of clouds flung in furious rout across the night, and the moon was veiled.\\n\\n\\\"Follow, lad!\\\" ordered the Master, and began to crawl silently forward. As stealthily Andrew pursued. And over the sodden ground they crept, one behind the other, like two' night-hawks on some foul errand.\\n\\nOn they crawled, lying prone during the blinks of moon, stealing forward in the dark; till, at length, the swish of the rain on the waters of the Tarn, and the sobbing of the fock in front, warned them they were near.\\n\\nThey skirted the trembling pack, passing so close as to brush against the flanking sheep; and yet unnoticed, for the sheep were soul-absorbed in the tragedy in front. Only, when the moon was in, Andrew could hear them huddling and stamping in the darkness. And again, as it shone out, fearfully they edged closer to watch the bloody play.\\n\\nAlong the Tarn edge the two crept. And still the gracious moon hid their approach, and the drunken wind drowned with its revelry the sound of their coming.\\n\\nSo they stole on, on hands and knees, with hearts aghast and fluttering breath; until, of a sudden, in a lull of wind, they could hear, right before them, the smack and slobber of bloody lips, chewing their bloody meal.\\n\\n\\\"Say thy prayers, Red Wull. Thy last minute's come!\\\" muttered the Master, rising to his knees. Then, in Andrew's ear: \\\"When I rush, lad, follow!\\\" For he thought, when the moon rose, to jump in on the great dog, and, surprising him as he lay gorged and Unsuspicious, to deal him one terrible swashing blow, and end forever the lawless doings of the Tailless Tyke.\\n\\nThe moon flung off its veil of cloud. White and cold, it stared down into the Devil's Bowl; on murderer and murdered.\\n\\nWithin a hand's cast of the avengers of blood humped the black boulder. On the border of its shadow lay a dead sheep; and standing beside the body, his coat all ruffled by the hand of the storm--Owd Bob--Owd Bob o' Kenmuir.\\n\\nThen the light went in, and darkness covered the land.\\n\\nChapter XXIX  THE DEVIL'S BOWL\\n\\nIT was Owd Bob. There could be no mistaking. In the wide world there was but one Owd Bob o' Kenmuir. The silver moon gleamed down on the dark head and rough gray coat, and lit the white escutcheon on his chest.\\n\\nAnd in the darkness James Moore was lying with his face pressed downward that he might not see.\\n\\nOnce he raised himself on his arms; his eyes were shut and face uplifted, like a blind man praying. He passed a weary hand across his brow; his head dropped again; and he moaned and moaned like a man in everlasting pain.\\n\\nThen the darkness lifted a moment, and he stole a furtive glance, like a murderer's at the gallows-tree, at the scene in front.\\n\\nIt was no dream; clear and cruel in the moonlight the humpbacked boulder; the dead sheep; and that gray figure, beautiful, motionless, damned for all eternity.\\n\\nThe Master turned his face and looked at Andrew, a dumb, pitiful entreaty in his eyes; but in the boy's white, horror-stricken countenance was no comfort. Then his head lolled down again, and the strong man was whimpering.\\n\\n\\\"He! he! he! 'Scuse ma laffin', Mr. Moore--he! he! he!\\\"\\n\\nA little man, all wet and shrunk, sat hunching on a mound above them, rocking his shrivelled form to and fro in the agony of his merriment.\\n\\n\\\"Ye raskil--he! he! Ye rogue--he! he!' and he shook his fist waggishly at the unconscious gray dog. \\\"I owe ye anither grudge for this--ye've anteecipated me \\\"--and he leant. back and shook this way and that in convulsive mirth.\\n\\nThe man below him rose heavily to his feet. and tumbled toward the mocker, his great figure swaying from side to side as though in blind delirium, moaning still as he went. And. there was that on his face which no man can mistake. Boy that he was, Andrew knew it..\\n\\n\\\"Feyther! feyther! do'ee not!\\\" he pleaded, running after his father and laying impotent. hands on him.\\n\\nBut the strong man shook him off like a fly, and rolled on, swaying and groaning, with that awful expression plain to see in the moonlight.\\n\\nIn front the little man squatted in the rain, bowed double still; and took no thought to flee.\\n\\n\\\"Come on, James Moore! Come on!\\\" he laughed, malignant joy in his voice; and. something gleamed bright in his right hand, and was hid again. \\\"I've bin waitin' this a weary while noo. Come on!\\\"\\n\\nThen had there been done something worse than sheep-murder in the dreadful lonesomeness of the Devil's Bowl upon that night; but of a sudden, there sounded the splash of a man's foot, falling heavily behind; a hand like a falling tree smote the Master on the shoulder;\\\\~ and a voice roared above the noise of the storm:\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Moore! Look, man! look!\\\"\\n\\nThe Master tried to shake off that detaining grasp; but it pinned him where he was, immovable.\\n\\n\\\"Look, I tell yo'!\\\" cried that great voice again.\\n\\nA hand pushed past him and pointed; and. sullenly he turned, ignoring the figure at his. side, and looked.\\n\\nThe wind had dropped suddenly as it had risen; the little man on the mound had ceased to chuckle; Andrew's sobs were hushed; and in the background the huddled flock edged closer. The world hung balanced on the pinpoint of the moment. Every eye was in the one direction,\\n\\nWith dull, uncomprehending gaze James Moore stared as bidden. There was the gray dog naked in the moonlight, heedless still of any witnesses; there the murdered sheep, lying within and without that distorted shade; and there the humpbacked boulder.\\n\\nHe stared into the shadow, and still stared.\\n\\nThen he started as though struck. The shadow of the boulder h\\\\~d moved!\\n\\nMotionless, with head shot forward and bulging eyes, he gazed.\\n\\nAy, ay, ay; he was sure of it--a huge dim outline as of a lion couchant, in the very thickest of the blackness.\\n\\nAt that he was seized with such a palsy of trembling that he must have fallen but for the strong arm about his waist.\\n\\nClearer every moment grew that crouching figure; till at length they plainly could discern the line of arching loins, the crest, thick as a \\\\~stallion's, the massive, wagging head. No mistake this time. There he lay i the deep..est black, gigantic, revelling in hi horrid debauch--the Black Killer!\\n\\nAnd they watched him at his feast. Now he burrowed into the spongy flesh; now turned to lap the dark pool which glittered in the moonlight at his side like claret in a silver cup. Now lifting his head, he snapped irritably at the rain-drops, and the moon caught his wicked, rolling eye and the red shreds of flesh dripping from his jaw. And again, raising his great muzzle as if about to howl, he let the delicious nectar trickle down his throat and ravish his palate.\\n\\nSo he went on, all unsuspicious, wisely nodding in slow-mouthed gluttony. And in the stillness, between the claps of wind, they could hear the smacking of his lips.\\n\\nWhile all the time the gray dog stood before him, motionless, as though carved in stone.\\n\\nAt last, as the murderer rolled his great. head from side to side, he saw that still figure. At the sight he leaped back, dismayed. Then with a deep-mouthed roar that shook the waters of the Tarn he was up and across his. victim with fangs bared, his coat standing' erect in wet, rigid furrows from topknot to tail.\\n\\nSo the two stood, face to face, with perhaps\\\\~ a yard of rain-pierced air between them.\\n\\nThe wind hushed its sighing to listen. The moon stared down, white and dumb. Away at the back the sheep edged closer. While save for the everlasting thunder of the rain, there was utter stillness.\\n\\nAn age, it seemed, they waited so. Then a voice, clear yet low and far away, like a bugle in a distant city, broke the silence.\\n\\n\\\"Eh, Wullie!\\\" it said.\\n\\nThere was no anger in the tones, only an incomparable reproach; the sound of the cracking of a man's heart.\\n\\nAt the call the great dog leapt round, snarling in hideous passion. He saw the small,' familiar figure, clear-cut against the tumbling sky; and for the only time in his life Red Wull was afraid.\\n\\nHis blood-foe was forgotten; the dead sheep' was forgotten; everything was sunk in the agony of that moment. He cowered upon the ground, and a cry like that of a lost sbul was wrung from him; it rose on the still night air and floated, wailing, away; and the white waters of the Tarn thrilled in cold pity; out of the lonely hollow; over the desolate Marches; into the night.\\n\\nOn the mound above stood his master. The little man's white hair was bared to the night wind; the rain trickled down his face; and his hands were folded behind his back. He stood there, looking down into the dell below him, as a man may stand at the tomb of his lately buried wife. And there was such an expression on his face as I cannot describe.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie, Wullie, to me!\\\" he cried at length; and his voice sounded weak and far, like a distant memory.\\n\\nAt that, the huge brute came crawling toward him\\\\~,,on his belly, whimpering as he came, very pitiful in his distress. He knew his fate as every sheep-dog knows it. That troubled him not. His pain, insufferable, was that this, his friend and father, who had trusted him, should have found him in his sin.\\n\\nSo he crept up to his master's feet; and the little man never moved.\\n\\n\\\"Wullie--ma Wullie!\\\" he said very gently. \\\"They've aye bin agin me--and noo you! A man's mither--a man's wife--a man's dog! they're all I've iver had; and noo am o' they three has turned agin me! Indeed I am alone!\\\"\\n\\nAt that the great dog raised himself, and placing his forepaws on his master's chest tenderly, lest he should hurt him who was already hurt past healing, stood towering above him; while the little man laid his two colds hands on the dog's shoulders.\\n\\nSo they stood, looking at one another, like a man and his love.\",\"timestamp\":1641284141,\"title\":\"\\nThe two, however, were not allowed to start upon their way until they had undergone a critical inspection\"},\"digest\":\"wk8nZoC-4c0d_BhlWPdOFb810i95IsPro9B-vxpdmIY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x994E4477C12eEdA205e5484164bDb84f9649036F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uGquEsl9FS1U-F6DGnZs2JfqFjq4yM47rlAdN86L9rw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P8kLOmkT9kKe2RyHT7zOHxVLjGc9OpxLopc7Liw1tbI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bpP7j5ivzOohDbTQRE_VeGP4cb7JP1tMBshbnutDaXlEUxjMoax8myiJX5gJqAo99bn1-O4EAwksz-lEiP3fwg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xae8ad5f9fdd6781ccce9cb1c6c15ec6d43794a2a32f676519d2fbebd729544787d0c9c82ecdfe5af96ed5889f45346337b6a6d1a0edc18be1f6e35dccfbcfedc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uGquEsl9FS1U-F6DGnZs2JfqFjq4yM47rlAdN86L9rw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P8kLOmkT9kKe2RyHT7zOHxVLjGc9OpxLopc7Liw1tbI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wk8nZoC-4c0d_BhlWPdOFb810i95IsPro9B-vxpdmIY\"}"
