"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As I reflect back on the past 4 months of my life, I realize that I’ve experienced some high highs and that I’ve experienced pretty low lows. \\n \\n\\nWhat’s been particularly buzzing in my mind has been the lows, though. \\n\\nIt’s been waking up every day to feel like people don’t believe in your abilities… as if don’t already ask yourself the same question each day - do I have the ability to get the job done.\\n\\nIt’s been the realization that each and every one of your ideas may be torn down as if there isn’t already so little left to tear down in you.\\n\\nIt’s knowing that each day you’re going to have to fight to get your point across. As if your hands aren’t already bleeding.\\n\\nBut today’s buzz is different.\\n\\nI’m reminded that I’ve learned more in these last 4 months than I’ve learned in any accumulated year.\\n\\nProduct Design, Product Management, Frontend Development.\\n\\nAnd this is only the beginning, I’m not talking about all the software I’ve been using such as Hubspot, AWS Quicksights, Zendesk, the list goes on and on.\\n\\nWhat a pity it would be to walk away from this when I know I haven’t even touched the surface of what else I can learn in the next 4 months. \\n\\nAnd all just because of one other person.\\n\\nIs it worth walking away from the purpose and call over my life?\\n\\nWorth it to walk away from the light God has shone for me at this moment?\\n\\nAll in the name of “I’m tired of fighting every day.”\\n\\nHave I forgotten everything else I’ve been through? \\n\\nWere all the sweat and tears and the hard work all in vain? Is it not worth me fighting for? \\n\\nIf I come out with bruises, so be it. \\n\\nI’ve fought life and death wars before, this is just a simple matter of inconvenience.\\n\\nAn inconvenience I’m willing to fight until I fulfill the purpose over my life in this season.\\n\\nWe don’t wrestle against flesh and blood. My colleagues are not who I’m wrestling against. \\n\\nIt’s spiritual principalities and warfares that are trying to build themselves against my purpose and call.\\n\\nAgainst what I’ve been placed on this earth to fulfill today, next year, and the rest of my life. \\n \\n\\nSo, will I quit - no!\\n\\nWill I leave this job - no!\\n\\nWill it be hard - hell yeah!\\n\\nWhat am I going to do - \\n\\nFIGHT! With everything in me. \\n\\nI’m not leaving here until God says “well done, we’re done.”\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1637439582,\"title\":\"If not for them, then at least do it for yourself \"},\"digest\":\"wAEpgYs7QdY8M256En6pD9rE_0_p91MLFo-eN-F1N4o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9946213d6ea191df77F9e6F68665261Fc40750B0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wUgHSrfy_xp-H-eiL8RtwnErO4I7AHG46ihmJViB_qw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"c0uOs49L5PRBSaWirHLQKCK_x1NDfeaB9Y2Tqucvqyo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EBa7gFX7artwx0mAt1OBIDTK8ou-dhbnUH8v46iAe2DJzfqAyfaw3k93HtlCTp4oEmPh5LyDmzBUhKcnFz_RXg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb8717640bf7918257e094edd21dad6ab0d5c6f1c88fa29af3b90e03b74be08085d044937d190eab90d31ca5605789aee9c5e446b754c75e9ce7f18979b54b6fa1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wUgHSrfy_xp-H-eiL8RtwnErO4I7AHG46ihmJViB_qw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"c0uOs49L5PRBSaWirHLQKCK_x1NDfeaB9Y2Tqucvqyo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wAEpgYs7QdY8M256En6pD9rE_0_p91MLFo-eN-F1N4o\"}"
