"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[KlimaDAO](https://klimadao.finance) unlocks a big shift in how we think about climate change and carbon removal. In only one month+ of its existence, the DAO has already catalyzed many new ideas. Stuff that seemed to be possible before. One of the most inspiring ideas I came across is [CO2_COMPOUND](https://co2compound.klimadao.finance/).\\n\\n![CO2_COMPOUND (non-moving screenshot)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tDvSyNr79WLi-g7I2F8PS.png?height=1256&width=1278)\\n\\nCO2_COMPOUND is declaring itself as a carbon compounding artwork. It was created by [Sven Eberwein](https://twitter.com/__s_v_n__), an artist based in Los Angeles who has also contributed to the KlimaDAO genesis. The mechanism is beautifully designed:\\n\\nThe piece depicts a black hole. But it also reminds me of a human pupil. It’s a moving image minted as an NFT on Polygon.\\n\\nWhat's special about the piece is that it is not only an NFT connected to a movie file. CO2_COMPOUND is also **fused with staked sKLIMA** token. At the launch 1 KLIMA was packed into it. The sKLIMA is irreversibly baked into the artwork’s smart contract. It can neither be unstaked nor redeemed. The artwork will hold and stake KLIMA as long as KlimaDAO exists. As of writing this, the staking rewards have already increased the artwork’s value to 2.894 $KLIMA. Right now it is backed by 16.141 based carbon tons (=current risk free value).\\n\\nthe artwork has its own [website](https://co2compound.klimadao.finance/) on the KlimaDAO domain where you can follow the current amount of Carbon locked.\\n\\nCO2_COMPOUND comes several beautiful and interesting ramifications:\\n\\n1. As the KLIMA it holds cannot be sold, CO2_COMPOUND will be the **last staker standing**.\\n2. CO2_COMPOUND becomes an **economic actor** in its own right. Neither the owner of the artwork nor the artist can change the financial intent of the artwork in the future.\\n3. The artwork is also a **climate activist** through holding KLIMA. It contributes to the DAO by holding and staking and therefore serves to create price pressure on the carbon market.\\n\\nThe CO2_Compound was auctioned by [OceanDrop](https://oceandrop.art/), a charitable NFT art auction to raise funds for marine conservation. It reached a price of 7.5 ETH on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x08e253270240509e57b9543c0453f0bac839d0a1/0) bought by a user called greenfund. All proceeds going towards the conservation efforts.\\n\\nI think this is just the first time, someone will bake in climate activism into art. I am very excited how this idea can be adapted in the future. sKlima can be used as add on value to so many things.\",\"timestamp\":1639997017,\"title\":\"An Artwork with Baked-in Climate Activism\"},\"digest\":\"dks_9OrAWLACh2Vtox0M_4ZBonztsOEqiUhzX8-UQ04\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x22AC0E18853d749d46716274682b4aDDa206cA3f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CC1D-ryh1KjHi7VyX5XlFA_lPlHDaqHxNtu1pdnvhyA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Xy7YvNRXbmzGqVicsG0LwtPABh6ngNRdKvR8i6uHxA4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KN2r3WExemSoOWK5lu4MNrUfaDlZYEEahSRPlQeHPpSd1vqMgWU3WXwStk3In5Yjy9WylwGRfHHTjMy7CV8yvQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf5f22f78cae0de7157abca194e1418376beffcdf77e3866951858f32cbc901001cf966df1137870ad832c616d76ca8b4aba1538d6955e321b930f813757b148d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CC1D-ryh1KjHi7VyX5XlFA_lPlHDaqHxNtu1pdnvhyA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Xy7YvNRXbmzGqVicsG0LwtPABh6ngNRdKvR8i6uHxA4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rDrrJG_X0qOYDsE01bIwTm4zsJkZcR5UyCHKWhWv0L4\"}"
