"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Some have asked why I’m still on Clubhouse. Well, I’m not building a community over there. I have a group of about 9 or 10 people who get together on Clubhouse every Tuesday evening to literally waste 30 minutes. It doesn’t really matter to me where we meet. We just started to do it on Clubhouse so we’ve continued on that platform. \\n\\nAlthough the platform has had more and more problems as of late, so we may be moving to Twitter spaces in the future. \\n\\nAnyway, as I test out all kinds of platforms, Mirror is another one. I wanted to publish my first NFT post on Mirror just to see how it goes. Seemed to make sense that I would waste my time and money (ETH) by minting a blog post about the other way I waste time during the week. So, let’s add the image and mint away. \",\"timestamp\":1637795483,\"title\":\"Waste 30 minutes of your evening - nothing legal\"},\"digest\":\"oXUJPUxNnHm1IYAtA_oUecVip_5sO0wK3k7xwVi3Kz0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCbbd18d3aC27ab0FFfD04BCCd091B2802c92e0ca\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ybJxfGWH3MSRPmuzwhuzITgjv8HS9rSbL2QQsb59pTc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ino5dDGL8H4wih1xHSiU-UJEgVoC7mzq5aEEEeJU0rI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ptjmujyFMd6XCrb47BMqbkgYpgXIjtrb_ydGEQU8ZZX3KI2w4OwEg0fbblIVku51T_EipNu5UEV6Dtb3Y661dg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x88857a2dc6654f541210c33cf9c001ba8bb9b51c6e44b6d3bfd3ecd69a294ed12e35a463801de13ec77d10a2ca99bbd0e0bf773b6582fd5feedbf5d05adb0f591b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ybJxfGWH3MSRPmuzwhuzITgjv8HS9rSbL2QQsb59pTc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ino5dDGL8H4wih1xHSiU-UJEgVoC7mzq5aEEEeJU0rI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oXUJPUxNnHm1IYAtA_oUecVip_5sO0wK3k7xwVi3Kz0\"}"
