"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Shaan Puri, a well-known KOL and investor, recently tweeted about his understanding of the meta universe. He believes that many people are wrong about the meta universe. He believes that the meta universe is not a virtual place, but a moment. It is a moment when digital life is more valuable than physical life. This is not a change overnight, but a gradual change that has taken place for 20 years.\\n\\n1. First: everyone is wrong about the meta universe.\\n\\nMost people think that the \\\"meta universe\\\" is a virtual place. Just like the movie \\\"number one player\\\", or a virtual world, as minecraft, roblox or Zuckerberg showed in a Facebook presentation.\\n\\nBut what if it's not a place?\\n\\n1. Second: the meta universe is not a place, but time.\\n\\nTime? Yes, for a moment.\\n\\nDo you know that there is a concept of \\\"singularity\\\" in artificial intelligence? This is the moment when artificial intelligence becomes smarter than humans. Artificial intelligence > the moment of human intelligence\\n\\n1. Third: what is the meta universe?\\n\\nThe meta universe is a time when our digital life is more valuable than our physical life. This is not a change overnight, or some Steve Jobs type of invention.\\n\\nIt is a gradual change that has taken place for 20 years.\\n\\n1. Every important part of life is going digital.\\n\\nWork -- > from factories to laptops. Turn the meeting room to zoom.\\n\\nFriends -- > from neighbors to fans. Where did you find like-minded people? Twitter, reddit, etc\\n\\nGames -- > more children play fortress night than basketball and football combined.\\n\\n1. The identity -- > filter is a new component. A story is your personal billboard to promote your identity.\\n\\nWhat do you look like in real life? Or what you look like on instagram? Which is more important.\\n\\nThe picture on the left is what they see, so it's important.\\n\\nwXV83VxcpQ8h8Q0vbTTz084raIGijMsw3FztzV6S.png\\n\\n1. Everything is digital. Your friends, your job, your identity.\\n\\nNow with cryptocurrency, your assets are online.\\n\\nThe boring monkey is the new Rolex. Fortnite skin is the new skinny jeans.\\n\\nIf everyone has been wandering online, your activities need to be digitized.\\n\\n1. Therefore, if you look forward 10 to 20 years, we will enter the meta universe.\\n\\nThe digital world is more important to us than the physical world. We used to focus 99% of our attention on our physical environment.\\n\\nTV dropped to 85%, computer dropped to 70% and mobile phone dropped to 50%\\n\\n1. Our attention has shifted from entities to numbers.\\n\\nWhere attention is, energy is.\\n\\nIf 50% of our attention is on our digital screen, then 50% of our energy will be spent on our digital life.\\n\\nToday, taking out the mobile phone from your pocket requires some action.\\n\\n1. Soon, some companies will make smart glasses in front of us all day.\\n\\nWe will increase from 50% screen attention to more than 90%.\\n\\nThat's when the meta universe began. Because at that moment, our virtual life will become more important than our real life.\\n\\n1. Is this a good thing or a bad thing?\\n\\nLike anything, it is neither good nor bad. It's just one thing.\\n\\nVery different things.\",\"timestamp\":1636206566,\"title\":\"Investor: many people have misunderstood the meta universe, which has been happening for 20 years\"},\"digest\":\"2NCWBezdKSnT5CsWwyT230zfnQIiblqYpympgZqqNfU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6688E117972d5419D9ae810284A0CcA3A77ea60A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HusoNrzrsqB8BtUm7WDvQXHmPKGlDcyyBThsVw52eIk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2p2AI9HSYMNnrOxE7QPQVXjdu7kvsJK44dzMEo52foQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aMhSy7wRfMf4ak_QLWdIWZdGZX80vhjlnKfSXy4D3brUXedsdHU3-We8b8mydF0J8rBDDemu7gECZfyx5wzUPQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xce4e59a633bef81afc792281fe96649f668ba184bda3bb7de8244b53cd63d85b4481eecad2ad4c227813a65eb2d06ee1e8925be9d63c9ab07af42bed0f654d9d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HusoNrzrsqB8BtUm7WDvQXHmPKGlDcyyBThsVw52eIk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2p2AI9HSYMNnrOxE7QPQVXjdu7kvsJK44dzMEo52foQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2NCWBezdKSnT5CsWwyT230zfnQIiblqYpympgZqqNfU\"}"
