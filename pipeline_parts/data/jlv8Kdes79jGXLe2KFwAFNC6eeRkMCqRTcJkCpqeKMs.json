"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Key reasons why blockchain gaming economy is the future\\n\\nThe global gaming market is currently worth $180 billion and is the fastest-growing form of entertainment globally. For reference, the global film industry is worth $100 billion and all North American sports combined are $73 billion in terms of annual revenues. Experts [predict](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/esports-streaming-industry-is-projected-to-be-the-fastest-growing-segment-of-global-gambling-sector-301318069.html#:\\\\~:text=PALM%20BEACH%2C%20Fla.%2C%20June,over%20150%20billion%20US%20dollars) that the number of streamers of online games will rise to one billion by 2025, which are one in nine people today. Gaming economies are the future, and they will happen on blockchains. Now we will outline the reasons why the future of gaming will become increasingly connected within the crypto world.\\n\\n***Decentralization*** - On top of a blockchain, anyone can create a game. This indicates that blockchain games built on top of layer-one blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, Cosmos, and others should be expected in the future. Users will be able to switch games quickly and easily, bringing their assets with them, such as NFTs in the form of skins, avatars, or weapons. It is not necessary to own a gaming platform in order to do so.\\n\\n***Open source technology*** - Operating and capital expenditures are mostly outsourced to the Ethereum foundation layer blockchain, making it considerably easier for entrepreneurs to launch a game. Low entrance barriers encourage competition. The end-users benefit as a result of this.\\n\\n***Permissionless*** - With just a smartphone and an internet connection, anyone can join and earn money according to the P2E model.\\n\\n## Top trending metaverse and gaming projects:\\n\\nMany news are occurring at the moment in the metaverse and blockchain world. Here are some of the most trending projects that are not just meant to make quick profit but provide a chance to interact with the gaming blockchain technology itself and experience the essence of Play to Earn model (P2E). Here is the current list for the month of November according to Coingecko:\\n\\nAlthough the games mentioned above are currently popular, the industry is extremely competitive and companies have to do their best to keep the audience interacting with them. It's crucial to figure out which games have what it takes to make it. There is an approaching wave of extreme legit gaming creators, such as Superfarm, who have held off on releasing their game until it is absolutely ready, until it is truly triple AAA grade, and which will be launched shortly after. Therefore, Superfarm is another solid project to look into and be prepared ahead of the herd.\\n\\nDespite all the benefits of the blockhain technology integrated within gaming, we should not truly forget that games are essentially meant to be fun. Sometimes the most important aspects cannot be measured by its features but by its interactions between the players and games.\\n\\n## Vulcan Forged and Sandbox partnership\\n\\nToday, an Epic collaboration was announced between [Vulcan Forged](https://egamers.io/recommends/vulcanverse/) and The  Sandbox, with 400 special edition NFT avatars. The recent launch of the gaming Decentralized Exchange VulcanDex has allowed Vulcan Forged to incorporate NFT Farming by letting users provide liquidity into pools and receive NFTs as rewards. The collaboration between these two massive projects has led to the creation of 400 characters. The “Sand Wizard” and the “Charon” will be used as an avatar in The Sandbox and as a playable companion in the Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game (MMORPG) VulcanVerse.  Vulcan Forged’s native token is known as PYR and is available on trading exchanges such as Gate.io, KuCoin and Uniswap. It’s market is around 350 million dollars, which is still 6 times lower than The Sandbox. Considering the recent news and strong partnerships, it could be a solid project worth looking at as a mid to long-term investment.\",\"timestamp\":1637535382,\"title\":\"The great future of blockchain gaming\\n\"},\"digest\":\"yQ0-DB-rRvI0odbGMCnF-7jjIBiaE7YEPifcg4DslGs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd57722111412Bf8fD260827426202A04de47899F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ce8zR4j3udL1cxOKHp3g6SS4tK3DX660ib10Kf-uDEI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7nbkCw2_4M4-mRBCZWQuKHeQ5wdl8ZSyj_W9TlVDwkE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sL0PSF25gotA2b63T-QxIOMLYsf_Bq20tnyexNzdn3Qgwj0r9n_VEiSPLB-OhakjVszTu_KkHzbioNve8ual3A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xed8568689e8dcde62de5d4be3a928815ae04db0a88e693ecc1b4482ea12a56cf295fc7d630b29645067bdaf83a8879dd2e79db259ecb4ad5319b800050a6a9161b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ce8zR4j3udL1cxOKHp3g6SS4tK3DX660ib10Kf-uDEI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7nbkCw2_4M4-mRBCZWQuKHeQ5wdl8ZSyj_W9TlVDwkE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yQ0-DB-rRvI0odbGMCnF-7jjIBiaE7YEPifcg4DslGs\"}"
