"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As regulators and lawmakers have interacted more and more with the crypto industry in recent years, the people who can link the two have taken on central roles in how crypto is regulated. Leading the charge is the Blockchain Association, with membership including eToro, Digital Currency Group, Uniswap, Kraken and Grayscale, and with executive director Kristin Smith at the helm. \\n\\nBefore founding the Blockchain Association in 2018, Smith spent a decade and a half on Capitol Hill, both as a congressional staffer and a lobbyist. Today, she and the Blockchain Association are involved in just about every major policy change that touches on crypto.\\n\\n**Smith’s 2020:** \\n\\nIn 2020, the Blockchain Association pushed the conversation forward on cryptocurrencies on a wide range of public policy issues, writing educational reports and meeting with leaders behind the scenes. In addition to amplifying congressional leaders at the forefront of crypto-friendly legislation — such as Tom Emmer, Bill Foster and Warren Davidson — the association advocated on behalf of companies facing Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement, including Telegram. Smith was instrumental in sounding the alarm on the Treasury Department’s proposal to limit access to self-hosted wallets and has written to the Treasury on the subject. The Hill also named Smith one of the top lobbyists of 2020. \",\"timestamp\":1639033628,\"title\":\"It's important for the crypto community to play a role in this space\"},\"digest\":\"Wcg5vvh9RQwvSsESLwDPnHWBYPiZEvhF2Wp8BuMbTTs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbFB7274590157C4aAAdd7870A01fBEEfdbfC268b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TN34qtJcLluBmagRFvapOo13xBg_XJSWofKH3PvqHbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ruGD1uyf0a068pBE6h4R9haLR4Rjqowa-bMVKGP8BvU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OSm8XMpo6Y_2peNy10qjLPi8RF2TuBLZSwNLIecxSZJeyQxNVcru01LskDu1yrOCSEa2LYjUol3jqNUFpRai2g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x11cb53ca9a0c63af31ebc5a5056598a36ac0b060a6f38ae0520ee062d2cb93874ec84fb04f3bf8c274a1282c771a230452029dfb70afa657fbcd49173c764a671b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TN34qtJcLluBmagRFvapOo13xBg_XJSWofKH3PvqHbM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ruGD1uyf0a068pBE6h4R9haLR4Rjqowa-bMVKGP8BvU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Wcg5vvh9RQwvSsESLwDPnHWBYPiZEvhF2Wp8BuMbTTs\"}"
