"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’m very lucky to be able to participate in the first round of Star Shark’s beta testing. Due to the short test time, this tweet briefly talks about Star Shark.\\n\\nGame IP and mode: Use the ocean as the theme and Shark Warrior as the core, players can freely choose PvE in Adventure or PvP in Arena\\n\\n**Game Requirements**\\n\\n1. Wallet address\\n2. Own greater or equal to Three Sharks\\n\\n**The Basic of Game Steps**\\n\\n1. Team up : select three sharks to make a team, based your combat strategy. Each shark position is very important, it will directly determine the attack firepower and defensive ability during the battle.\\n2. PvP or PvE: Choose the mode Adventure(PvE) or Arena(PvP)\\n3. Combat: Play in turn order, choose different skill cards based energy points. Please pay attention to the energy point will affect the deals.\\n\\n**Gain Power Sharks**\\n\\nThere are several main ways for gaining powerful sharks:\\n\\n1，rent (marketplace) - see the related Gif\\n\\n2，buy (marketplace) - no gif, same to rent\\n\\n3，upgrade (user center) - see the related Gif\\n\\nEach way has a different focus, for example, rent can easy get strong shark for rental time but have to pay revenue, upgrade need to use two sharks and SSS token. You can look at the upgrade Gif which show the process and upgrade shark.\\n\\nAfter getting a new power Shark on the StarSharks website, re-enter the App side and you will see that your Shark has been updated.\\n\\n**Token Economic Model**\\n\\nUnfortunately, I have been reporting errors in DAO where to lock SSS, so I have not been able to experience the function of this stake. And when I read the white paper, page 7 \\\"Weekly settlement method: liquidity pool secures earnings 1,000 BNB, 10,000 SSS while dividend from the week is 1,000 BNB and 1,000 SSS\\\" really makes me confuse.\\n\\nGeneral speaking, participating in PvE and PvP, ranking or refer and SSS pledges will have corresponding token rewards and consumption. In addition, Star Shark team has a series of token burn mechanisms, which are too complicated and hard-core to understand for me.\\n\\nIn all, there is no specific statistics for SEA and SSS. So, keep watch and wait for Interpretation.\\n\\n**Brief summary**\\n\\nStar Shark Warriors is really beginner-friendly, although there are minor problems in some parts of the website and app, such as word, filtering functions, etc., but the overall game experience is very smooth and will not have much impact.\\n\\nLast and important, if you want to be master, you requires raise and rent stronger sharks, combat with witty formations, and more knowledge of sharks and skill cards. In the future, Star Sharks will be Top in Metaverse, gamefi, cotent-fi platform!\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1636105310,\"title\":\"StarSharks Beta Test Experience\"},\"digest\":\"bKYyy0VTTnMDASd0QewRJIQHxfOdLfkjOVDol1UlXMg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8FBEc4D1A46DC75c6Dfc9278A2DAFAd20d571AC4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"l9G2k5UFC3agz4O6v0XH_17hPuNF7OP1JNKCQ3k2J9M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ckBeZB4Zucis7YtKOf-oKnU5xkJ0JOkJldLPwtTDhw8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qMx81Ezw96w4xWo3qqwXuxhFl882EG-9cn5_YwqQnBMl-EU6d9oDkWFXUqRsV7O39TCcuyysc3VKnwggSO_wIA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xaabb5f290af0802a8ffe73ccc528dec22cb0906f28086301cf2bbbc33a1f853c343a06d09cd83b041ef224e6234dfb9772a5c7d1948762cd101fd5d22e4c56b31b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"l9G2k5UFC3agz4O6v0XH_17hPuNF7OP1JNKCQ3k2J9M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ckBeZB4Zucis7YtKOf-oKnU5xkJ0JOkJldLPwtTDhw8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bKYyy0VTTnMDASd0QewRJIQHxfOdLfkjOVDol1UlXMg\"}"
