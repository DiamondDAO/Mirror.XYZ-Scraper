And if you don’t take care of that one, **it is likely your digital alias will stop showing up as well**.\\n\\n> ***World 2 = the ORL : “on real life”;*** *here we are talking about **AR specifically**. This augmented, digital layer placed on top of our real world provides exciting possibilities and will reach more than those participating in the metaverse (let’s face it, gaming isn’t for everyone).*\\n>\\n> ***World 3 = the LTL : “larger than life”;*** *This is what the metaverse should be built for. Why would you want a “digital twin” of your boring as hell fleece sweatshirt when you can wear something on fire, molten liquid, or shoes as tall as a skyscraper?*\\n\\nDigital-only is not our main focus at Alterrage, but we realise the importance of the metaverse, and **leverage co-creation** to create **digital-only capsules** alongside our **PHYGITAL collections (IRL + ORL)**.\\n\\n*\\\\[Learn more how Alterrage leverages these three worlds with the [METARALITY formula](https://www.alterrage.com/shop), the first and only, created by Alterrage\\\\].*\\n\\nAs we wait for the metaverse to be built (or all of them, depending on your opinion), for Web 3.0 to develop, and for the general community to grasp an understanding of these concepts, we still have an opportunity that **anyone who can take a photo on their smart phone can understand**.\\n\\n**That opportunity is** **AR (augmented reality) Filters.** They are **instantly interactive**, **importable into any digital meeting**, and a huge hit **even hanging out with friends in IRL**.\\n\\nEvery other Sunday on the Alterrage Official discord \\\\[[join here](https://discord.gg/pTTHBtavfz)\\\\], Alterrage hosts **“BYOF”** (bring your own filter) parties, the world’s first soirée to merge **AR filters**, **personal style**, and a **good time with ALTER\\\\[friends\\\\]**.\\n\\nBelow we will show you how to add these filters with existing tech and join our event for **POAP rewards**, insider **sneak peeks**, and an opportunity to actually wear digital fashion, **instead of just talking about it**.\\n\\n# FILTER TUTORIAL BELOW to get started NOW :\\n\\n**SNAPCHAT**\\n\\nFor now, we use Lens Studio by Snapchat to create our filters.\\n\\nThough these filters cannot yet be owned by smart contracts or be monetised by the creator, the technological capabilities currently outsmart that of Spark AR (created by Instagram) and can be imported across several different video meet up platforms.\\n\\nFilters on Instagram cannot currently integrate with any video conferencing software.\\n\\n**The Three Steps for All Platforms :**\\n\\n1. Find a Filter on [Lens List](https://lenslist.co/) (make sure to choose snapchat, not spark) or [Lens](https://lens.snapchat.com/) by Snapchat.\\n2. Download [SnapCamera](https://snapcamera.snapchat.com/) (desktop / laptop only).\\n3. Import selected filter according to platform.\\n\\nThe process is quite straightforward for each platform, though sometimes may have technical glitches if the correct video output is not selected.\\n\\nMake sure these settings are as follows on Snapcamera :\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6cVt-YnS3iH_rCYL9_O-W.png?height=1270&width=2188)\\n\\n# DISCORD\\n\\n> *The current platform for Alterrage BYOF events*\\n\\n[Watch the video tutorial here.](https://www.loom.com/share/e9dc8b5d9a8c463c89e141ae0020bcc3)\\n\\nAfter recently speaking with the customer help service for discord, **even they didn’t know you can use AR filters on their platform**.\\n\\n1. Open Snap Camera (you can set this up in your computer settings so it opens automatically when turning on your computer). The green light on your computer will be illuminated when Snap Camera is activated.\\n2. Select your filter either by searching in the library or from one you have already saved.\\n3. If you are using an Alterrage NFT AR Filter, copy the full link of the unlocked snapchat code \\\\[found on Opensea\\\\] and paste into the search bar of Snap Camera\\n4. This should then show up overlaid onto your video. If it does not appear, that means the filter will not work.\\n5. Open up the discord app and start a video call or enter a voice channel. Turn on your camera, and select Snap Camera. If the Snap Camera option does not show up, see troubleshooting at the end of the article or how I did it on the [video tutorial](https://www.loom.com/share/e9dc8b5d9a8c463c89e141ae0020bcc3).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jtBeHCUqAee9J7tz0u9O4.png?height=414&width=1088)\\n\\n# GOOGLE MEETS\\n\\n1. Open Snap Camera (you can set this up in your computer settings so it opens automatically when turning on your computer). The green light on your computer will be illuminated when Snap Camera is activated.\\n2. Create or attend the google meets event through your Google calendar.\\n3. The video option should now show up, asking if you are ready to join the meeting.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/waBpp8qADVdFxsKBmAiDe.png?height=1034&width=2318)\\n\\n4\\\\. If the filter isn’t showing up, go to the “check your audio and video” settings to verify that the source of the video is set to Snap Camera.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tN51g49vmESuuy9FaX2ZN.png?height=1428&width=2686)\\n\\n# ZOOM\\n\\n1. Open Snap Camera (you can set this up in your computer settings so it opens automatically when turning on your computer). The green light on your computer will be illuminated when Snap Camera is activated.\\n2. Start a meeting from the zoom app or join a link of a previously create meeting.\\n3. The video option now should show up on the video if you are in the meeting.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Xl8_1d6OaGSCoogHXjX3z.png?height=1596&width=2442)\\n\\n4\\\\. If not, to video settings and make sure Snap Camera is selected.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/deHx6Ic8_30NasfTIlFyo.png?height=1294&width=1572)\\n\\n# LOOM\\n\\n1. Open Snap Camera (you can set this up in your computer settings so it opens automatically when turning on your computer). The green light on your computer will be illuminated when Snap Camera is activated.\\n2. Log into your loom account, and make sure Snap Camera is selected.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_EsSW3FyXFhMQSJ6sMWlE.png?height=1738&width=2402)\\n\\n**TROUBLESHOOTING** :\\n\\nIf you are still having problems with a program on your desktop or laptop, try the following :\\n\\n1. Restart your computer.\\n2. Open Snap Camera before opening the video application.\\n3. Try opening discord in a chrome or safari browser instead of the application. Sometimes there is a problem with the privacy settings in the app alone, so by opening in a browser it can align with the open permissions already set up on your computer, assuming you have successfully used zoom or google meets before.\\n4. Try Chrome if Safari isn’t working (or vice versa).\\n5. Reconfigure your privacy settings for video on your computer.\\n6. If this still isn’t working, contact [Snapchat](https://support.snapchat.com/en-US) or the customer service according to the brand of your computer.\\n\\nThe reality is, few people know that you can even do this, but by following these simple steps you can show off your favourite fashion filters instantly.\\n\\nDon’t have anything to wear to BYOF?
