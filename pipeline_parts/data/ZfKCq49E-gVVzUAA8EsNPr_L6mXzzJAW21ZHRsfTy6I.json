"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve had a lot of people in my real life starting to pick up on the things I’m doing in the DeFi space, and always want in when they find out that I’m making $7500+ per month with minimal effort and a low initial investment.\\n\\nPhoto by [Shubham Dhage](https://unsplash.com/@theshubhamdhage?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral)\\n\\nYep — that is correct, as of the writing time of this article I have the potential to earn about $7500/mo from [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) alone if I wanted to claim it out every day.\\n\\nBut this article isn’t about my incredible success in the DeFi world (#humblebrag) — it’s about how I think that YOU should put your $500 to work for you today, and do it in the most stable project that I am a part of in this space.\\n\\nThat project is [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7). What is [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) you ask? The short version is: [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) is a DeFi project that can provide passive income. You purchase your [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) and deposit it into the Faucet, then the Faucet pays you 1% per day every single day in new [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) tokens. You can choose to Hydrate (compound) your daily 1% back into your deposit so you receive more tomorrow, or you can choose to claim your earnings back out. That is an extremely simplified version, but hits the highlights.\\n\\nNow I’m going to do something that I don’t typically do in my articles, I’m going to spell out exactly what $500 put into [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) today will look like in 1 year.\\n\\nI’ll be using the price on the [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) Swap page for converting BNB to [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) for this, and the current [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) price there is: $41.50, with the Current price of BNB at $568, we’re going to convert .88 BNB ($500) to [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) in the Swap page.\\n\\nWe’ll receive 11.78 [DRIP](https://jccrypto-69007.medium.com/drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) for that — that’s perfect, it will leave us with just over 10 [DRIP](https://jccrypto-69007.medium.com/drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) in our deposits after the deposit tax is taken out.\\n\\nWe’re also going to implement a strategy of hydrating only for the first 30 days.\\n\\nSo you start with 10 [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7), then at the end of 30 days of Hydrating, you have 13.155 [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7), and if the price stays at $41.50 (it won’t, it will most likely increase) you will be earning $5.46 per day (before taxes). That will get you about $165/mo — just from putting that initial $500 in.\\n\\nFrom there, we’re going to switch to a strategy of alternating claiming and compounding for the rest of 1 year.\\n\\nFollowing exactly what I laid out above, hydrating every day for 30 days — then alternating claim/hydrate every other day — on Day 365 you will have 63.803 [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) in your deposits. Your daily rewards would be: .63 [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7), or $26.23 if the price is still $41.50.\\n\\nSince you are alternating Claiming and Hydrating, you would have claimed a dollar value of $1700 (that is after all taxes taken out, and assuming that $41.50 price), and then you’re earning that $26.23 per day on top of that.\\n\\nAfter a year, you could switch to claim more often — if you claimed every day for 1 month you would make just under $800 for that month at this point.\\n\\nIn these examples, I used $41.50 for the [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) price because that’s today’s number on the Swap page. The price won’t be $41.50 — but that’s a good place to keep things reasonable. The [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) community is calling for $75+ price for [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7), and I’ve even seen the developer say that he can make a case for a [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) price over $3,000.\\n\\n.63 [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7)/day @ $3000 is $1890/day. Not bad for a quick easy $500 start is it?\\n\\nSo there it is — my simple straight forward plan for you to turn $500 into a lot more than $500 within a year.\\n\\nWant to read a bit more about [DRIP](https://drip.community/faucet?buddy=0x861A3193Cbc4f186596B4B5bb704D3CE1Bc4F3B7) before getting started?
