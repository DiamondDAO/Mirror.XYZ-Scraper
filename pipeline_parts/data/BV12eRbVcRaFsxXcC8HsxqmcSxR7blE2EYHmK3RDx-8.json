"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1976, Albuquerque, New Mexico\\n\\nTo succeed means a willingness to fail, the willingness to face questions not yet asked.\\n\\nIt’s not just you & your best friend, dropping out of college with an idea.\\nIt’s not just you & your best friend, with your first business customer.\\n\\nOthers, bright enough to know things, were not brave enough to fail and face questions. They did not drop out, they did not begin with one buyer.\\n\\nEverybody has the answers, you spend a lot of time on questions. You don’t just ask for the sake of asking, you don’t waste your ego and time.\\nYou hire more people to help you. You bombard with questions, you need to know how they think. All “straw men” leave you silent and impatient.  The ones who can make a “steel man” for the blast forge of your interrogation, are the ones who help you succeed.\\n\\nIf they have the mettle, their metal makes you mightier.\\n\\nYour silence is condemnation, you don’t waste time on questions for their own sake.\\n\\nYour interrogation is indoctrination, and others do the same. They’ve a name for it. The “Rude Q&A”. They learn \\\"come at me as hard as you can\\\".\\nIf an idea or argument survives the “Rude Q&A”, then maybe something is there. Maybe.\\n\\n“Straw men” arguments are burnt away where “Steel men” survive.\\n\\nNobody just dips their toes in the water when you ask them questions, they’re either diving deep, or they leave the room, and your company.\\n\\nWhen someone can change your mind, you accept it, move on, move up, because you don’t waste time on ego.\\n\\nIt’s not just you and your best friend anymore, you have a business to grow. You need people willing to fail, to face questions not yet asked.\",\"timestamp\":1642284794,\"title\":\"1976: 8.8 To Succeed You Must To Succeed Means A Willingness To Fail, The Willingness To Face Questions Not Yet Asked\"},\"digest\":\"32hHkLi3GVDEt7QSFqaaPDlk7UzM06eg42VyFxkVaj0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Nyr5YmoChcZlpxEKHjl07e3UCxrw6qzlqA9Dv0gNP3u6fjYvw23Gmo2NsxLRyCsXXva1n1-fWLumnyQbM2AKMA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x939c3e74a74214d6af1d91162bfa0388ffcf1810af9855b8880f77fac5246e92763b9303b41ee3fbd48236f8d0f8e555ab6e872cb7d0c6983323d6d9cc5c151c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ahsVofNYdTDqdhgIHsqvjeYOcfdgp6YQWETfx7-uMZo\"}"
