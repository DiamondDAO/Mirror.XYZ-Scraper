Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought. If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox … If with a pure mind a person speaks or acts happiness follows him like his never-departing shadow.”**\\n\\n[\\\\[37\\\\]](#_ftn37)\\n\\nGiven that it is a fundamental shared quality of all feeling life-forms, suffering has within it the seeds of compassion and wisdom. These can lead the sufferer out of the prison of their mind. We must nurture these seeds in ourselves and others to slow, and even stop, the continual clockwork of hurt.\\n\\n**“Bless you prison, bless you for being in my life. For there, lying upon the rotting prison straw, I came to realize that the object of life is not prosperity as we are made to believe, but the maturity of the human soul.”**\\n\\n(*Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn*)[\\\\[38\\\\]](#_ftn38)\\n\\nThis is not to advocate loss of loved ones or liberty, in order for the reader to experience a potential moment of clarity or enlightenment about the nature of things. However, everyone has suffered in some form or another in their past, and no one knows the future. We must therefore use our imaginations and creative capacities to seek to extend this understanding to all other life-forms that can suffer too. Failure to do so means we are very likely sowing the seeds for great suffering for our children and their children, ‘who will reap what we sow’.\\n\\nAs we will explore, in the section on sacrifice, one of the great tragedies of life is the banality of wrongdoing or unethical behaviour. It does not usually take place in darkened rooms by a cabal of ‘evil’ elites. Wrongdoing is a problem of perspective and misunderstanding of the nature of things, a product of our decisions about what can suffer. It is the language we use to make these judgements and the implicit assumptions, amplified in our cultures, about what people and other life-forms are deserving of compassion. It is the banality of wrongdoing that makes it so pervasive.\\n\\nThis is the tragedy and curse of being a belief-driven being. Yet, like snow melting at the first touch of the sun’s rays, this type of ignorance or wilful blindness disappears on contact with warmth and light. If we let it in and do not turn away from it. If we are willing to be present and open to the suffering of others, a part of which we all share.\\n\\n![Vincent van Gogh, “The Sower”, 1888 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*hlkAKaxPIeLYX46BJ9zeAQ.jpeg?&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![(Wilfred Owen)\\\\[39\\\\]](https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1\\\\*GuqSAg6YFYXp4UTvToZY4w.png?&&&size=medium)\\n\\n![“Kindermord von Bethlehem.” St Alban’s Psalter, 1100’s CE, Wikipedia, public domain](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MBU1RU3_uBi6wROEi6E-G.jpeg?height=1294&width=1000)\\n\\nSuffering can go far beyond the simple physical pain of a feeling life-form. In its most heart-breaking form, it goes to the root of what it means to feel utterly separate to the world and others as a sentient life-form.\\n\\nIt arises from the impermanence of things and life-forms and our attachment to things that must always be in flux and changing, from thwarted desires and terrible regrets, loneliness or imprisonment.\\n\\nSuffering requires either a belief in or feeling of ‘self’ that is separate from the universe — and so it can potentially be felt by all sentient life-forms.\\n\\nFor humans, it can manifest as a feeling of being uniquely punished for something. In the deepest human hurt, it can manifest as a cry to the gods or the universe asking for justice or relief from unbearable mental anguish — a cry or roar of “Why me?” when the gods, fate or fortune decide that it is our turn on the karmic wheel of sorrow.\\n\\nPerhaps even Jesus, the person that is alleged to have believed himself the son of God within the Christian tradition, may have had a moment of doubt about the truth of a universal being’s love.[\\\\[40\\\\]](#_ftn40) This moment in history continues to draw us back to try to understand whether this man really believed he was the unique son of God, or whether this story grew up around him (or after him).\\n\\n*Was Jesus of Nazareth more simply a wise and holy man who sought to show us that we are all the sons and daughters of the universal energy of life?

It is not just a story for religious people who have certain beliefs; it manifests extraordinary powers as a central part of humanity’s universal folklore. In our modern quest to rationalise the world, we are in danger of ‘throwing the baby out with the bathwater’.\\n\\n**“Suffering is a gift from the Gods in order to make men see the whole of life.”**\\n\\n(*Muhammad Iqbal*)[\\\\[45\\\\]](#_ftn45)\\n\\nOf course, like any other collective organisation, religion has at times been responsible for the most abhorrent behaviour.

The writing of it was extraordinarily cathartic and calming. It simplified my anguish. Providing me with respite when I was tired of humans and of being human.\\n\\nThis creative process — an identification with a deeper life-cycle in my moment of ‘aloneness’ — allowed me to move forward with living, despite the mental pain. The healing power of poetry, being an attempt to become whole again, or holy, is an alchemy the very best scientists recognise and respect.

Suffering, like desire, is infinite; it is also collective, though it may feel individual. Readers will understand that necessarily this book must omit so much more than it can cover — there are so many examples that could be included but many of those are dealt with more comprehensively elsewhere.\\n\\nThe intention is not to write an academic book, as this is a personal journey to make sense of life. That means relying upon my feelings, experiences, suffering and reason to walk through these difficult concepts. I trust that, given the universal nature of all of these concepts, parts of this personal journey will leap off the page to connect with some readers.\\n\\nIn a later section on sacrifice, we explore a few examples of the continuous desire for humans to make someone or some group ‘pay’ for their own sense of wellbeing. This calculation or passion can reach extreme forms. A dangerous desire to make others pay appears to lie at the core of being a thinking, sentient being. It is a conscious, subconscious and perhaps even unconscious (encoded) form of self-love and utilitarian assessment. It arises naturally in a world where consumption of other life-forms — and therefore death — is a means of survival and regenesis.\\n\\n**“O Rose thou art sick. / The invisible worm, / That flies in the night / In the howling storm: / Has found out thy bed / Of crimson joy: / And his dark secret love / Does thy life destroy.”**\\n\\n(*William Blake*)[\\\\[55\\\\]](#_ftn55)\\n\\nIn sapient beings, there is the potential to use wisdom and compassion to act ethically, notwithstanding the self-love which is at the root of self-protection. Belief systems that seek to deny the validity or reality of the suffering of others are easy to see and avoid — they are those in which the ethical heart of such assessment has been abandoned to make it easier to justify the self-centred action.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/IQZvVz8FiG6EPFycETaA1ct25MGlOFBl-RLMIfyYCtM](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/IQZvVz8FiG6EPFycETaA1ct25MGlOFBl-RLMIfyYCtM)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[36\\\\]](#_ftnref36) Suggested reading: Donald Kalsched, *Trauma and the Soul*, 2013 CE and *The Inner World of Trauma*, 1996 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[37\\\\]](#_ftnref37) “[Yamakavagga: Pairs](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.01.budd.html)”, translated from the Pali by Acharya Buddharakkhita, Access to Insight.\\n\\n[\\\\[38\\\\]](#_ftnref38) Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, *[The Gulag Archipelago](https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2944012)*, 1973 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[39\\\\]](#_ftnref39) “Move him into the sun — Gently its touch awoke him once, / At home, whispering of fields half-sown.
