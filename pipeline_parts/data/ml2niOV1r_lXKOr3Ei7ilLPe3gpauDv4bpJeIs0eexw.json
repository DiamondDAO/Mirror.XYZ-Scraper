"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> The original Internet was invented in the 1970s by the US government to protect its nuclear weapons from hacking.\\n\\nIn 1970s, computer scientists in US Military realized a single computer controlling all the rockets in peak Cold War was a recipe for disaster. So they built a decentralized network of multiple computers instead.\\n\\n![Compute to War](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MkGegRha-mjZSD8vFhN89.png?height=1012&width=2024)\\n\\nThis meant the US could keep its part of the \\\"mutually assured destruction\\\" bargain even in case of a Soviet cyberattack.\\n\\n## Web 1\\n\\nIn 1990, the Internet was a bunch of connected computers. The web was its first application, created by Tim Berners-Lee.\\n\\n**Web1 was designed as a \\\"hyperlinked information system.\\\"** A giant library of data sourced together on a screen from computers all across the network for users to browse by clicking around linked text and images.\\n\\nSounds familiar?\\n\\n30 years later, three billion users are connected to a much bigger, faster and more ubiquitous web, powered by monstrous data centres. The clicking around has remained largely the same.\\n\\nIn its early days, the web was a niche tool, used almost exclusively by academics. Mass adoption came five years later with the introduction of browsers like Mosaic and Microsoft Internet Explorer.\\n\\nThese were the good old surfing days. You'd dial in. Downloading a picture took years. Altavista was the default search engine. Nobody had thought of web design yet.\\n\\n![Read-Only](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8kPjDLmXUg-Uv46n6hfGb.png?height=1012&width=2024)\\n\\nweb1 was:\\n\\n* **Decentralised** — Powered by regular computers from regular users.\\n* **Open-source** — Anyone could build on the web.\\n* **Read-only** — Publishing content required some technical skills, so most users were readers.\\n\\nWeb1's decentralised infrastructure symbolised its original ethos. **Anyone could publish information of any kind, to anyone in the world, without the permission of central gatekeepers.**\\n\\n## Web2\\n\\nFast-forward 10 years, the Wild West had grouped around winners like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, pulling in huge numbers of users and talent black-hole style.\\n\\nFor the first time, anyone could publish online. As barriers faded, users and usage surged. The Internet had something for everyone.\\n\\n![Omni Platform](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/yj5q94_Z3DfsUOn25YDsD.png?height=1012&width=2024)\\n\\nIn the backend, three big shifts shaped web2 as we know it today:\\n\\n* **Mobile** — Smartphones move us from a few hours per day at our desktops to \\\"always connected\\\". Apps and notifications rule our lives.\\n* **Social** — Friendster, MySpace and Facebook get us to show our faces and emerge from anonymity. They make it easy to create, share, interact and recommend. We go from sharing photos with friends to getting into strangers' cars.\\n* **Cloud** — Amazon, Google and Microsoft make it cheap to build on the web. Instead of having to buy and maintain expensive hardware infrastructure, you can now rent it low-cost from vast data centres around the world.\\n\\nThe Internet has become centralised. **It's essentially a bunch of closed systems interacting with each other.**\\n\\n*Continued in #2 | Big Tech is extracting you*\\n\\n`#Web3 will reinvent our relationships with computers and each other. it's a new paradigm of identity that will bring synergy to the future of work, and will create a new shared reality in the metaverse.`\",\"timestamp\":1639700260,\"title\":\"Web 3 is coming FOR YOU | #1 Short history of the Web\"},\"digest\":\"UpNMRhVvGjpM0g0TWBQlnxrcjoC4Eqv1IIjAcVJFCwg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2D0a51e142BF3F156A978175C05eC74a25BB4E4F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CD-1k45NqyrJuAzjtyQOwJPHOekNMme0OroWrwzm7do\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BEOY-B7mdVe6NZuq5wLVrByg1JCLnXhjuN1z_oeBGMs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LqY1ukrHRJwTcFaIoukJOJQS-1_aHt1XpkS3BCuO_lG5jIvxf5f_HgIBpOkPmYFY6Djb5LIJsVxFpWs5qb5N0Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x554db33c96b8e47f21aa51609e9574bb4d9d1bccf56699ee3ed2ec911b1f9f5b441a23ef2cd37995db150b6143228bfd143b8155f5f4c4215863dd01565f75511c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CD-1k45NqyrJuAzjtyQOwJPHOekNMme0OroWrwzm7do\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BEOY-B7mdVe6NZuq5wLVrByg1JCLnXhjuN1z_oeBGMs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UpNMRhVvGjpM0g0TWBQlnxrcjoC4Eqv1IIjAcVJFCwg\"}"
