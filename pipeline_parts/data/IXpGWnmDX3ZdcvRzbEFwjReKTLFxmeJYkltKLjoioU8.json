The classes will consist of 25 students each to ensure that students can interact with professors and their colleagues.”\\n\\nAccording to Gago, what is commonly referred to as decentralized finance today will eventually become simply finance in the future, which is why she believes that teaching DeFi-focused courses is necessary: “We hope that the students taking these courses can build an impactful network by being surrounded by others who are there to learn and contribute to the blockchain sector.”\\n\\n## Challenges of teaching DeFi\\n\\nWhile it’s notable that universities are beginning to offer DeFi courses, the fast-paced, developing nature of the cryptocurrency sector may create challenges for professors.\\n\\nFor instance, coming up with a syllabus that addresses the most relevant topics in DeFi may be problematic. Nejadmalayeri explained that during the Spring 2021 semester, he had to change everything in his Blockchain and Financial Services course as DeFi started to gain traction: “I had to take out many of my lectures and replace those with DeFi concepts.”\\n\\n***Related: [The perfect storm: DeFi hacks will advance the crypto sector moving forward](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-perfect-storm-defi-hacks-will-advance-the-crypto-sector-moving-forward)***\\n\\nEchoing this concern, Giaglis noted that it can be challenging to develop a curriculum when there's almost nothing to rely upon and when the sector is literally changing by the day: “Suffice to say that we do not consider the material finalized at any point: we are making and will continue to make changes to reflect new developments up until (and beyond) the date of each session.”\\n\\nHowever, industry participants believe that DeFi courses are here to stay and will become an integral part of education moving forward. For instance, Alex Tapscott, author and instructor of Coursera’s Blockchain Revolution Specialization series of courses, told Cointelegraph that as the DeFi industry grows, the demand for educational content will also increase:\",\"timestamp\":1639035675,\"title\":\"These are all live, online, cohort-based classes that begin\"},\"digest\":\"rhLIUQyw-lZzcKAojcF_1FNAcvITBZDHxaWkVMDjejE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xce2E0daa2fF996B2e11Ed7da4fe7aCfE560DB361\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Eljh9sGtrv2AOuK1eXT1XMHQ40pPYut9rv2q250u6Ec\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MQMFCK52sSImh7SrezJLJB-MZivlNdE137ZlRUPH7iI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"cCnEm_pxS6Mt06SgcMl3a7DNOzAHeEC1jj3Vjr84Rp4NgZVZDGz2nSx1GI2yJAthAblRVmb9NwQlRagjZhiOYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a30517e3b3e5c99f65e1b76abfee15d55925642ee970d974b5459fc24ba77504110abe4aec1cae4bd119b9f586747e024b8d1d6c36a8f6971e8570e9dca5fc21c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Eljh9sGtrv2AOuK1eXT1XMHQ40pPYut9rv2q250u6Ec\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MQMFCK52sSImh7SrezJLJB-MZivlNdE137ZlRUPH7iI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rhLIUQyw-lZzcKAojcF_1FNAcvITBZDHxaWkVMDjejE\"}"
