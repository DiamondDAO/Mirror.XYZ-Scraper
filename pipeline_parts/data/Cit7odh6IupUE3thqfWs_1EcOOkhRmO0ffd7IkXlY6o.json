In our Queens, New York City apartment, we endure lock down, our entry into the pandemic. I hear eight-year old giggling and then I tell him to get off YouTube for the millionth time. I want to slam the lid shut. But he’s supposed to be in school; he needs it to connect with his friends. Now every time I look, he’s opening and closing windows like a secret agent.\\n\\nHe’s a social kid who’s cut off. I hear him talking to his friends. His I’m-taking-you-seriously voice, his laughing voice, his squealing voice, his excited-and-competitive voice, his frustrated voice. Phones, tablets, and laptops orchestrate a community of 8-year olds typing, messaging, chatting, clicking away Online.\\n\\n8-year old has been my co-worker for over a year now, and he’s constantly clicking. Our desks are side-by-side, so I lean over and say, “Please stop clicking! I’m grading papers.” When we attempt to tug, limit, it’s-been-5-hours — at his brimming bottles of tech, he explodes. We’re online too much, planning, teaching, grading ourselves. Daily, I motion for 8-year old to get off YouTube, snapping my fingers while, simultaneously talking to my students. He smiles as he \\\\*slowly \\\\*shifts his laptop away from my vision.\\n\\nWhen I tech-cut 8-year old, he staggers into living room, eyes glazed, arms waving like zombie, muttering and maniacally laughing, possessed by the flickering light. When enough unplugged time has passed, he curls up in bed with his 72 beloved *Naruto* books. He learns how to peel a hard-boiled egg, and says thoughtfully, “This is very satisfying.”\\n\\n**Since pandemic beginnings**, fourteen-year-old got up each morning and stood across from me, eye-to-eye, to see if he had yet surpassed my height, moaning he wasn’t growing fast enough. Then one day, he meets me eye-to-eye, and grins. Suddenly he’s is above my eye. He’s taller than me.\\n\\nHe outgrows his pants, shoes and t-shirts. His voice lowers; he feels deeply. He teenage slams doors, cracking the frame. Restless. Agitated. He reaches and pushes away. We go through the bewilderingly complex process of applying to New York City high schools. He loses it, raging, sobbing, face red with the frustration of being with us too much. An hour later he hugs me and says sweetly, “I love you, Mom.”\\n\\n14-year old wants to watch movies with me, but doesn’t like any movies I suggest. “That’s so boring,” he says, rolling his eyes. But because of 14-year old, I see *The Sound of Metal* and I can’t stop thinking about that scene, where the rocker/drummer Ruben, who’s suddenly lost his hearing, goes to live in a house with deaf people. One day Ruben goes up a ladder to fix the roof, and his sponsor Joe taps the ladder and makes Ruben get down. At the table, Ruben says, “I was trying to fix your roof.” Joe responds with clarity, “You don’t need to fix anything here.”\\n\\nInstantly I choke up. I think of all the times in my life that I’ve tried to learn like other people, tried to mother like other people, tried to fix myself so no one would notice my dyslexia. I wonder what happens when we don’t try to fix ourselves?\\n\\nAnd so, I remind myself to show love when 14-year old is inflexible. He wants connection; he wants activism. He wants to walk down the hill, past the large group of police officers to the Black Lives Matter vigil for Breonna Taylor. Masked, his little brother and I follow him. \\\\*Wait, wait! \\\\*I whisper-command him. 14-year old doesn’t turn around. I don’t expect him to go so far into the crowd. I thought we’d be on the outside edges. Instead he weaves through the masked people, ignoring me, so he can hear spoken-word tributes. He takes a 14-year old knee solemnly. Masked 8-year old turns to me and whispers, “Now we’re really going to get Covid!”\\n\\n**The first nine pandemic months**, I wanted to cheer everyone on. I wanted my friends who are caregiving their elderly parents suffering from strokes, dementia, heart disease, and visual impairment, to know I support them. I wanted to my friends who got sick with Covid to know I am there.\\n\\nBy February-pandemic 2021, I’m exhausted, momed-out, on my last wiving legs. I can no longer be tech police, time manager, toe-nail cutter, family motivator, family calmer, family organizer, family-Don’t-Throw-That-At-Your Brother! I am a dish washing closer, counter wiper, t-shirt folder, sock roller, bed maker, shelf duster, shower scrubber, clothes sorter, crumb sweeper, school-email-checker, calendar writer, butternut-squash bread maker. Oh! Shit! I’ve got 70 papers to grade! When the last time I was alone? When the last time I wrote something?\\n\\nSuddenly I feel sad all the time, like I’m sinking in the quick sand of depression, like motivation rip currented away, like hope is hightailing it out of me.\\n\\n“Why are you *always* yelling?” 14-year-old says to me when I ask him to do something.\\n\\n“Why are you yelling?” 8-year old says to me when I ask him to do something.\\n\\n“I’m not yelling! I’m just asking you to help. No one is helping me clean. I’m picking things up from morning until night! I can’t do it anymore!”\\n\\n“You always sound frantic,” 14-year-says critically.\\n\\n“I’m not frantic,” I say defensively.\\n\\nIt takes *two days* to admit to myself, I just might be *frantic*. It feels like everything is on me; if I don’t do it, who will? I make lists, charts, a chore jar. I call family meetings. I make schedules and post them on the fridge. No one follows any schedule, no one touches the chore jar. Nothing seems to work. No one will listen to me. I am not a good manager for the small business of this family. Can you please fire me?\\n\\n**I Zoom-sit in my bedroom** with my freshman Bronx students, 18 and 19-year old, immigrants and children of immigrants. A teenage United Nations. When I hear depression seep through their voices, I know that it’s up to me to give them purpose. My students tell me about getting Covid 19, about their parents getting Covid, about their grandparents’ deaths, about not leaving their Bronx apartment for months, about doing essential work. They tell me how hard it’s been to miss their senior year and begin college online, on their laptop, on their phone, beside demanding and loving sisters and brothers, in the same room as a blaring TV and a barking dog, in the same room as someone cooking and shouting, in the same room where the internet connection goes out abruptly.\\n\\nI ask them to please turn on their videos, and then stare at twenty-three black boxes for a whole semester. I am delighted to hear their voices, their earnestness and enthusiasm. “Isn’t it so ironic,” one of them says, “that *Resilience* is the theme of our class, when all this happened?!” When the last day comes, some can’t accept it’s over. “That’s it? We don’t come back?” they ask bewildered. “This is the only online class where I made friends.”\\n\\n**Spring comes** and I’ve stopped reaching out to friends, stopped agonizing about if something happened to me, what would happen to my kids? The first half of the day, I get things done. The second half, things fall apart. I am de-emotionalized, de-tached, de-motivated. Do you hear the screaming in the other room? “Why are you in HERE!” eight-year old shouts. “I’m just trying to GET,” 14-year old screams back. I hear shuffles, shoves, a HOWL.\\n\\nAfter I make dinner, I stare at the huge pile of clean laundry. I stare at my husband, on his computer. I should fold, sort, make piles, put them into drawers, but instead I walk into my room, look at my bed and feel its magnetic pull. It’s definitely *way too early* to crawl into bed. But everyone else is on their screens, or fighting with each other. I pick up my laptop, burrow and click, knowing I should do more, knowing I should mother my kids, knowing I should reach for the higher part of my brain, knowing I should reconfigure the habit loop. I know this because, I’ve escaped into the escape, and no longer want to escape.\\n\\n**As another pandemic semester draws to a close,** my students say to me, “You made me fall in love with reading again.” They say, “Thank you for being one of the best teachers I have had.” They say, “I appreciate how you made us and our stories matter.” They say, “I wish there was a class for the other teachers to learn how to teach Catherine.”\\n\\nMy students make me remember, I need to write. And I begin this piece because a friend tells me it’s important to write about women’s work, that caregiving is actual work, that teaching is caregiving, and that we need to make the invisible, visible.\\n\\nI don’t yet see Delta-Omicron variants looming ahead when I take my Now-9-year old to a grassy hillside in Astoria Park and unfurl a blanket. We climb aboard and listen to *Percy Jackson*. We lie back and stare upward into the dancing leaves and swaying branches. A barge moves up the East River. A train roars across the Hell Gate Bridge overhead as 9-year old and I smile at each other fondly. It’s hard to find these peaceful spaces with him, so I appreciate the momentary lightness as I roll over, and notice that I don’t have my glasses on. I glance down and there they are… under my leg. *My expensive progressives*. Twisted. Broken.\\n\\nI don’t have backups. I can’t really afford to get another pair. I move my leg and pick them up, one arm has completely fallen off. Wire sticks out beside the lens. “Oh my God!” I say. 9-year old’s eyes widen with concern. I pause. Normally I would freak out, get upset with myself, maybe even cry because it feels like I don’t have money to fix my mistakes. My anguish would upset 9-year old who is sensitive to my pain. I look at him. He gently tugs the glasses out of my hands and tries, unsuccessfully, to piece them together.\\n\\nI look at the broken glasses and suddenly laugh. “It’s okay. They’re broken. I’ll have to take them to be fixed. And they might not be able to be fixed, but that’s okay.” I put the broken glasses away; we lie back. I don’t need my glasses to see what is here. My shoulder touches 9-year old’s shoulder. I hold my unfixed self, mother, teacher, writer, and stare upward into the park sky.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*T1pg5Aw-HeccxG2PW4bhFA.jpeg)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640915590,\"title\":\"Invisible: The Fault Lines of Motherhood - Catherine Kapphahn - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"nURQJL8K3HcFNdCoRc3O-Bdg6qBCvPdW9Xu9QurEBis\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBFE7a4A2dDF45f0fF98adF02e21Bf5a0a222dA7B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X-EAFRl41sREE1MdcFN3BtK120w6pkmssq0TvDwerHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q6USmExA0zdj4fKr8LBcZor5AmEsQwbknDCpnvaI95Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TskmQD0_elTowxzJAr_m-Wy-3SoUFPQ9iUNwXg53D3bz_x1SLm5Ov7GzyYKLs3AZ4_mUxTlnGGZDosq2ASUn6Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x38cadd5bc701bda9c41b30eeed9ad315559e3a862e7ad388bc600b899c168e2231ea0426e555308425177da971a304a33bce4460153eaf95ce7a41f93e7bacbe1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"X-EAFRl41sREE1MdcFN3BtK120w6pkmssq0TvDwerHw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q6USmExA0zdj4fKr8LBcZor5AmEsQwbknDCpnvaI95Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nURQJL8K3HcFNdCoRc3O-Bdg6qBCvPdW9Xu9QurEBis\"}"
