"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A little time after I was helping King George V to get crowned, by walking round a local bonfire and listening to a local band.  Just as a bonfire cannot be too big, so (by my theory of music) a band cannot be too loud, and this band was so loud, emphatic, and obvious, that I actually recognised one or two of the tunes.  And I noticed that quite a formidable proportion of them were Jacobite tunes; that is, tunes that had been primarily meant to keep George V out of his throne for ever. Some of the real airs of the old Scottish rebellion were played, such as \\\"Charlie is My Darling,\\\" or \\\"What's a' the steer, kimmer?\\\"  songs that men had sung while marching to destroy and drive out the monarchy under which we live.  They were songs in which the very kinsmen of the present King were swept aside as usurpers.  They were songs in which the actual words \\\"King George\\\" occurred as a curse and a derision.  Yet they were played to celebrate his very Coronation; played as promptly and innocently as if they had been \\\"Grandfather's Clock\\\" or \\\"Rule Britannia\\\" or \\\"The Honeysuckle and the Bee.\\\"\\n\\nThat contrast is the measure, not only between two nations, but between two modes of historical construction and development.  For there is not really very much difference, as European history goes, in the time that has elapsed between us and the Jacobite and between us and the Jacobin. When George III was crowned the gauntlet of the King's Champion was picked up by a partisan of the Stuarts.  When George III was still on the throne the Bourbons were driven out of France as the Stuarts had been driven out of England.  Yet the French are just sufficiently aware that the Bourbons might possibly return that they will take a little trouble to discourage it; whereas we are so certain that the Stuarts will never return that we actually play their most passionate tunes as a compliment to their rivals. And we do not even do it tauntingly.  I examined the faces of all the bandsmen; and I am sure they were devoid of irony: indeed, it is difficult to blow a wind instrument ironically.  We do it quite unconsciously; because we have a huge fundamental dogma, which the French have not.  We really believe that the past is past.  It is a very doubtful point.\\n\\nNow the great gift of a revolution (as in France) is that it makes men free in the past as well as free in the future.  Those who have cleared away everything could, if they liked, put back everything.  But we who have preserved everything--we cannot restore anything.  Take, for the sake of argument, the complex and manycoloured ritual of the Coronation recently completed.  That rite is stratified with the separate centuries; from the first rude need of discipline to the last fine shade of culture or corruption, there is nothing that cannot be detected or even dated. The fierce and childish vow of the lords to serve their lord \\\"against all manner of folk\\\" obviously comes from the real Dark Ages; no longer confused, even by the ignorant, with the Middle Ages.  It comes from some chaos of Europe, when there was one old Roman road across four of our counties; and when hostile\\\" folk\\\" might live in the next village.  The sacramental separation of one man to be the friend of the fatherless and the nameless belongs to the true Middle Ages; with their great attempt to make a moral and invisible Roman Empire; or (as the Coronation Service says) to set the cross for ever above the ball.  Elaborate local tomfooleries, such as that by which the Lord of the Manor of Work-sop is alone allowed to do something or other, these probably belong to the decay of the Middle Ages, when that great civilisation died out in grotesque literalism and entangled heraldry.  Things like the presentation of the Bible bear witness to the intellectual outburst at the Reformation; things like the Declaration against the Mass bear witness to the great wars of the Puritans; and things like the allegiance of the Bishops bear witness to the wordy and parenthetical political compromises which (to my deep regret) ended the wars of religion.\\n\\nBut my purpose here is only to point out one particular thing.  In all that long list of variations there must be, and there are, things which energetic modern minds would really wish, with the reasonable modification, to restore.  Dr. Clifford would probably be glad to see again the great Puritan idealism that forced the Bible into an antique and almost frozen formality.  Dr. Horton probably really regrets the old passion that excommunicated Rome.  In the same way Mr. Belloc would really prefer the Middle Ages; as Lord Rosebery would prefer the Erastian oligarchy of the eighteenth century.  The Dark Ages would probably be disputed (from widely different motives) by Mr. Rudyard Kipling and Mr. Cunninghame Graham.  But Mr. Cunninghame Graham would win.\\n\\nBut the black case against Conservative (or Evolutionary) politics is that none of these sincere men can win.  Dr. Clifford cannot get back to the Puritans; Mr. Belloc cannot get back to the mediaevals; because (alas) there has been no Revolution to leave them a clear space for building or rebuilding. Frenchmen have all the ages behind them, and can wander back and pick and choose.  But Englishmen have all the ages on top of them, and can only lie groaning under that imposing tower, without being able to take so much as a brick out of it.  If the French decide that their Republic is bad they can get rid of it; but if we decide that a Republic was good, we should have much more difficulty.  If the French democracy actually desired every detail of the mediaeval monarchy, they could have it.  I do not think they will or should, but they could.  If another Dauphin were actually crowned at Rheims; if another Joan of Arc actually bore a miraculous banner before him; if mediaeval swords shook and.  blazed in every gauntlet; if the golden lilies glowed from every tapestry; if this were really proved to be the will of France and the purpose of Providence--such a scene would still be the lasting and final justification of the French Revolution.\\n\\nFor no such scene could conceivably have happened under Louis XVI.\\n\\nTHE SEPARATIST AND SACRED THINGS\\n\\nIn the very laudable and fascinating extensions of our interest in Asiatic arts or faiths, there are two incidental injustices which we tend nowadays to do to our own records and our own religion.  The first is a tendency to talk as if certain things were not only present in the higher Orientals, but were peculiar to them.  Thus our magazines will fall into a habit of wondering praise of Bushido, the Japanese chivalry, as if no Western knights had ever vowed noble vows, or as if no Eastern knights had ever broken them.  Or again, our drawing-rooms will be full of the praises of Indian renunciation and Indian unworldliness, as if no Christians had been saints, or as if all Buddhists had been.  But if the first injustice is to think of human virtues as peculiarly Eastern, the other injustice is a failure to appreciate what really is peculiarly Eastern.  It is too much taken for granted that the Eastern sort of idealism is certainly superior and convincing; whereas in truth it is only separate and peculiar.  All that is richest, deepest, and subtlest in the East is rooted in Pantheism; but all that is richest, deepest, and subtlest in us is concerned with denying passionately that Pantheism is either the highest or the purest religion.\\n\\nThus, in turning over some excellent books recently written on the spirit of Indian or Chinese art and decoration, I found it quietly and curiously assumed that the artist must be at his best if he flows with the full stream of Nature; and identifies himself with all things; so that the stars are his sleepless eyes and the forests his far-flung arms.  Now in this way of talking both the two injustices will be found.  In so far as what is claimed is a strong sense of the divine in all things, the Eastern artists have no more monopoly of it than they have of hunger and thirst.\\n\\nI have no doubt that the painters and poets of the Far East do exhibit this; but I rebel at being asked to admit that we must go to the Far East to find it.  Traces of such sentiments can be found, I fancy, even in other painters and poets.  I do not question that the poet Wo Wo (that ornament of the eighth dynasty) may have written the words: \\\"Even the most undignified vegetable is for this person capable of producing meditations not to be exhibited by much weeping.\\\"  But, I do not therefore admit that a Western gentleman named Wordsworth (who made a somewhat similar remark) had plagiarised from Wo Wo, or was a mere Occidental fable and travesty of that celebrated figure.  I do not deny that Tinishona wrote that exquisite example of the short Japanese poem entitled \\\"Honourable Chrysanthemum in Honourable Hole in Wall.\\\"  But I do not therefore admit that Tennyson's little verse about the flower in the cranny was not original and even sincere.\\n\\nIt is recorded (for all I know) of the philanthropic Emperor Bo, that when engaged in cutting his garden lawn with a mower made of alabaster and chrysoberyl, he chanced to cut down a small flower; whereupon, being much affected, he commanded his wise men immediately to take down upon tablets of ivory the lines beginning: \\\"Small and unobtrusive blossom with ruby extremities.\\\"  But this incident, touching as it is, does not shake my belief in the incident of Robert Burns and the daisy; and I am left with an impression that poets are pretty much the same everywhere in their poetry--and in their prose.\\n\\nI have tried to convey my sympathy and admiration for Eastern art and its admirers, and if I have not conveyed them I must give it up and go on to more general considerations.  I therefore proceed to say--with the utmost respect, that it is Cheek, a rarefied and etherealised form of Cheek, for this school to speak in this way about the mother that bore them, the great civilisation of the West.  The West also has its magic landscapes, only through our incurable materialism they look like landscapes as well as like magic.  The West also has its symbolic figures, only they look like men as well as symbols.  It will be answered (and most justly) that Oriental art ought to be free to follow its own instinct and tradition; that its artists are concerned to suggest one thing and our artists another; that both should be admired in their difference.  Profoundly true; but what is the difference?  It is certainly not as the Orientalisers assert, that we must go to the Far East for a sympathetic and transcendental interpretation of Nature.  We have paid a long enough toll of mystics and even of madmen to be quit of that disability.\\n\\nYet there is a difference, and it is just what I suggested.  The Eastern mysticism is an ecstasy of unity; the Christian mysticism is an ecstasy of creation, that is of separation and mutual surprise. The latter says, like St.  Francis, \\\"My brother fire and my sister water \\\"; the former says, \\\"Myself fire and myself water.\\\"  Whether you call the Eastern attitude an extension of oneself into everything or a contraction of oneself into nothing is a matter of metaphysical definition.  The effect is the same, an effect which lives and throbs throughout all the exquisite arts of the East.  This effect is the Sing called rhythm, a pulsation of pattern, or of ritual, or of colours, or of cosmic theory, but always suggesting the unification of the individual with the world. But there is quite another kind of sympathy the sympathy with a thing because it is different.  No one will say that Rembrandt did not sympathise with an old woman; but no one will say that Rembrandt painted like an old woman. No one will say that Reynolds did not appreciate children; but no one will say he did it childishly. The supreme instance of this divine division is sex, and that explains (what I could never understand in my youth) why Christendom called the soul the bride of God. For real love is an intense realisation of the \\\"separateness\\\" of all our souls.  The most heroic and human love-poetry of the world is never mere passion; precisely because mere passion really is a melting back into Nature, a meeting of the waters.  And water is plunging and powerful; but it is only powerful downhill.  The high and human love-poetry is all about division rather than identity; and in the great love-poems even the man as he embraces the woman sees her, in the same instant, afar off; a virgin and a stranger.\\n\\nFor the first injustice, of which we have spoken, still recurs; and if we grant that the East has a right to its difference, it is not realised in what we differ.  That nursery tale from nowhere about St. George and the Dragon really expresses best the relation between the West and the East. There were many other differences, calculated to arrest even the superficial eye, between a saint and a dragon.  But the essential difference was simply this: that the Dragon did want to eat St.  George; whereas St.  George would have felt a strong distaste for eating the Dragon.  In most of the stories he killed the Dragon.  In many of the stories he not only spared, but baptised it.  But in neither case did the Christian have any appetite for cold dragon.  The Dragon, however, really has an appetite for cold Christian--and especially for cold Christianity. This blind intention to absorb, to change the shape of everything and digest it in the darkness of a dragon's stomach; this is what is really meant by the Pantheism and Cosmic Unity of the East.  The Cosmos as such is cannibal; as old Time ate his children.  The Eastern saints were saints because they wanted to be swallowed up. The Western saint, like St. George, was sainted by the Western Church precisely because he refused to be swallowed.  The same process of thought that has prevented nationalities disappearing in Christendom has prevented the complete appearance of Pantheism.  All Christian men instinctively resist the idea of being absorbed into an Empire; an Austrian, a Spanish, a British, or a Turkish Empire.  But there is one empire, much larger and much more tyrannical, which free men will resist with even stronger passion.  The free man violently resists being absorbed into the empire which is called the Universe.  He demands Home Rule for his nationality, but still more Home Rule for his home.  Most of all he demands Home Rule for himself. He claims the right to be saved, in spite of Moslem fatalism.  He claims the right to be damned in spite of theosophical optimism.  He refuses to be the Cosmos; because he refuses to forget it.\\n\\nTHE MUMMER\\n\\nThe night before Christmas Eve I heard a burst of musical voices so close that they might as well have been inside the house instead of just outside; so I asked them inside, hoping that they might then seem farther away.  Then I realised that they were the Christmas Mummers, who come every year in country parts to enact the rather rigid fragments of the old Christmas play of St.  George, the Turkish Knight, and the Very Venal Doctor.  I will not describe it; it is indescribable; but I will describe my parallel sentiments as it passed.\\n\\nOne could see something of that half-failure that haunts our artistic revivals of mediaeval dances, carols, or Bethlehem Plays.  There are elements in all that has come to us from the more morally simple society of the Middle Ages: elements which moderns, even when they are mediaevalists, find it hard to understand and harder to imitate.  The first is the primary idea of Mummery itself.  If you will observe a child just able to walk, you will see that his first idea is not to dress up as anybody--but to dress up. Afterwards, of course, the idea of being the King or Uncle William will leap to his lips.  But it is generally suggested by the hat he has already let fall over his nose, from far deeper motives. Tommy does not assume the hat primarily because it is Uncle William's hat, but because it is not Tommy's hat.  It is a ritual investiture; and is akin to those Gorgon masks that stiffened the dances of Greece or those towering mitres that came from the mysteries of Persia. For the essence of such ritual is a profound paradox: the concealment of the personality combined with the exaggeration of the person.  The man performing a rite seeks to be at once invisible and conspicuous.  It is part of that divine madness which all other creatures wonder at in Man, that he alone parades this pomp of obliteration and anonymity.  Man is not, perhaps, the only creature who dresses himself, but he is the only creature who disguises himself.  Beasts and birds do indeed take the colours of their environment; but that is not in order to be watched, but in order not to be watched; it is not the formalism of rejoicing, but the formlessness of fear.  It is not so with men, whose nature is the unnatural.  Ancient Britons did not stain themselves blue because they lived in blue forests; nor did Georgian beaux and belles powder their hair to match an Arctic landscape; the Britons were not dressing up as kingfishers nor the beaux pretending to be polar bears.  Nay, even when modern ladies paint their faces a bright mauve, it is doubted by some naturalists whether they do it with the idea of escaping notice.  So merry-makers (or Mummers) adopt their costume to heighten and exaggerate their own bodily presence and identity; not to sink it, primarily speaking, in another identity.  It is not Acting--that comparatively low profession-comparatively I mean.  It is Mummery; and, as Mr. Kensit would truly say, all elaborate religious ritual is Mummery.  That is, it is the noble conception of making Man something other and more than himself when he stands at the limit of human things.  It is only careful faddists and feeble German philosophers who want to wear no clothes; and be \\\"natural\\\" in their Dionysian revels.  Natural men, really vigorous and exultant men, want to wear more and more clothes when they are revelling. They want worlds of waistcoats and forests of trousers and pagodas of tall hats toppling up to the stars.\\n\\nThus it is with the lingering Mummers at Christmas in the country.  If our more refined revivers of Miracle Plays or Morrice Dances tried to reconstruct the old Mummers' Play of St.  George and the Turkish Knight (I do not know why they do not) they would think at once of picturesque and appropriate dresses.  St.  George's panoply would be pictured from the best books of armour and blazonry: the Turkish Knight's arms and ornaments would be traced from the finest Saracenic arabesques.  When my garden door opened on Christmas Eve and St.  George of England entered, the appearance of that champion was slightly different.  His face was energetically blacked all over with soot, above which he wore an aged and very tall top hat; he wore his shirt outside his coat like a surplice, and he flourished a thick umbrella.  Now do not, I beg you, talk about \\\"ignorance\\\"; or suppose that the Mummer in question (he is a very pleasant Ratcatcher, with a tenor voice) did this because he knew no better.  Try to realise that even a Ratcatcher knows St.  George of England was not black, and did not kill the Dragon with an umbrella. The Rat-catcher is not under this delusion; any more than Paul Veronese thought that very good men have luminous rings round their heads; any more than the Pope thinks that Christ washed the feet of the twelve in a Cathedral; any more than the Duke of Norfolk thinks the lions on a tabard are like the lions at the Zoo.  These things are denaturalised because they are symbols; because the extraordinary occasion must hide or even disfigure the ordinary people.  Black faces were to mediaeval mummeries what carved masks were to Greek plays: it was called being \\\"vizarded.\\\" My Rat-catcher is not sufficiently arrogant to suppose for a moment that he looks like St.  George.  But he is sufficiently humble to be convinced that if he looks as little like himself as he can, he will be on the right road.\\n\\nThis is the soul of Mumming; the ostentatious secrecy of men in disguise. There are, of course, other mediaeval elements in it which are also difficult to explain to the fastidious mediaevalists of to-day.  There is, for instance, a certain output of violence into the void.  It can best be defined as a raging thirst to knock men down without the faintest desire to hurt them.  All the rhymes with the old ring have the trick of turning on everything in which the rhymsters most sincerely believed, merely for the pleasure of blowing off steam in startling yet careless phrases.  When Tennyson says that King Arthur \\\"drew all the petty princedoms under him,\\\" and \\\"made a realm and ruled,\\\" his grave Royalism is quite modern.  Many mediaevals, outside the mediaeval republics, believed in monarchy as solemnly as Tennyson.  But that older verse-\\n\\nWhen good King Arthur ruled this land   He was a goodly King--   He stole three pecks of barley-meal   To make a bag-pudding.\\n\\nis far more Arthurian than anything in The Idylls of the King.  There are other elements; especially that sacred thing that can perhaps be called Anachronism.  All that to us is Anachronism was to mediaevals merely Eternity.  But the main excellence of the Mumming Play lies still, I think, in its uproarious secrecy.  If we cannot hide our hearts in healthy darkness, at least we can hide our faces in healthy blacking.  If you cannot escape like a philosopher into a forest, at least you can carry the forest with you, like a Jack-in-the-Green.  It is well to walk under universal ensigns; and there is an old tale of a tyrant to whom a walking forest was the witness of doom.  That, indeed, is the very intensity of the notion: a masked man is ominous; but who shall face a mob of masks?\\n\\nTHE ARISTOCRATIC 'ARRY\\n\\nThe Cheap Tripper, pursued by the curses of the aesthetes and the antiquaries, really is, I suppose, a symptom of the strange and almost unearthly ugliness of our diseased society.  The costumes and customs of a hundred peasantries are there to prove that such ugliness does not necessarily follow from mere poverty, or mere democracy, or mere unlettered simplicity of mind.\\n\\nBut though the tripper, artistically considered, is a sign of our decadence, he is not one of its worst signs, but relatively one of its best; one of its most innocent and most sincere.  Compared with many of the philosophers and artists who denounce him; he looks like a God fearing fisher or a noble mountaineer.  His an- tics with donkeys and concertinas, crowded char-abancs, and exchanged hats, though clumsy, are not so vicious or even so fundamentally vulgar as many of the amusements of the overeducated.  People are not more crowded on a char-a-banc than they are at a political \\\"At Home,\\\" or even an artistic soiree; and if the female trippers are overdressed, at least they are not overdressed and underdressed at the same time.  It is better to ride a donkey than to be a donkey.  It is better to deal with the Cockney festival which asks men and women to change hats, rather than with the modern Utopia that wants them to change heads.\\n\\nBut the truth is that such small, but real, element of vulgarity as there is indeed in the tripper, is part of a certain folly and falsity which is characteristic of much modernity, and especially of the very people who persecute the poor tripper most.  There is something in the whole society, and even especially in the cultured part of it, that does things in a clumsy and unbeautiful way.\\n\\nA case occurs to me in the matter of Stonehenge, which I happened to visit yesterday.  Now to a person really capable of feeling the poetry of Stonehenge it is almost a secondary matter whether he sees Stonehenge at all.  The vast void roll of the empty land towards Salisbury, the gray tablelands like primeval altars, the trailing rain-clouds, the vapour of primeval sacrifices, would all tell him of a very ancient and very lonely Britain.  It would not spoil his Druidic mood if he missed Stonehenge. But it does spoil his mood to find Stonehenge--surrounded by a brand-new fence of barbed wire, with a policeman and a little shop selling picture post-cards.\\n\\nNow if you protest against this, educated people will instantly answer you, \\\"Oh, it was done to prevent the vulgar trippers who chip stones and carve names and spoil the look of Stonehenge.\\\"  It does not seem to occur to them that barbed wire and a policeman rather spoil the look of Stonehenge.  The scratching of a name, particularly when performed with blunt penknife or pencil by a person of imperfect School Board education, can be trusted in a little while to be indistinguishable from the grayest hieroglyphic by the grandest Druid of old.  But nobody could get a modern policeman into the same picture with a Druid.  This really vital piece of vandalism was done by the educated, not the uneducated; it was done by the influence of the artists or antiquaries who wanted to preserve the antique beauty of Stonehenge.  It seems to me curious to preserve your lady's beauty from freckles by blacking her face all over; or to protect the pure whiteness of your wedding garment by dyeing it green.\\n\\nAnd if you ask, \\\"But what else could any one have done, what could the most artistic age have done to save the monument?\\\"  I reply, \\\"There are hundreds of things that Greeks or Mediaevals might have done; and I have no notion what they would have chosen; but I say that by an instinct in their whole society they would have done something that was decent and serious and suitable to the place.  Perhaps some family of knights or warriors would have the hereditary duty of guarding such a place.  If so their armour would be appropriate; their tents would be appropriate; not deliberately--they would grow like that.  Perhaps some religious order such as normally employ nocturnal watches and the relieving of guard would protect such a place.  Perhaps it would be protected by all sorts of rituals, consecrations, or curses, which would seem to you mere raving superstition and silliness.  But they do not seem to me onetwentieth part so silly, from a purely rationalist point of view, as calmly making a spot hideous in order to keep it beautiful.\\\"\\n\\nThe thing that is really vulgar, the thing that is really vile, is to live in a good place Without living by its life.  Any one who settles down in a place without becoming part of it is (barring peculiar personal cases, of course) a tripper or wandering cad.  For instance, the Jew is a genuine peculiar case.  The Wandering Jew is not a wandering cad.  He is a highly civilised man in a highly difficult position; the world being divided, and his own nation being divided, about whether he can do anything else except wander.\\n\\nThe best example of the cultured, but common, tripper is the educated Englishman on the Continent.  We can no longer explain the quarrel by calling Englishmen rude and foreigners polite. Hundreds of Englishmen are extremely polite, and thousands of foreigners are extremely rude.  The truth of the matter is that foreigners do not resent the rude Englishman. What they do resent, what they do most justly resent, is the polite Englishman.  He visits Italy for Botticellis or Flanders for Rembrandts, and he treats the great nations that made these things courteously--as he would treat the custodians of any museum.  It does not seem to strike him that the Italian is not the custodian of the pictures, but the creator of them.  He can afford to look down on such nations--when he can paint such pictures.\\n\\nThat is, in matters of art and travel, the psychology of the cad.  If, living in Italy, you admire Italian art while distrusting Italian character, you are a tourist, or cad.  If, living in Italy, you admire Italian art while despising Italian religion, you are a tourist, or cad. It does not matter how many years you have lived there.  Tourists will often live a long time in hotels without discovering the nationality of the waiters.  Englishmen will often live a long time in Italy without discovering the nationality of the Italians.  But the test is simple.  If you admire what Italians did without admiring Italians--you are a cheap tripper.\\n\\nThe same, of course, applies much nearer home.  I have remarked elsewhere that country shopkeepers are justly offended by London people, who, coming among them, continue to order all their goods from London.  It is caddish to wink and squint at the colour of a man's wine, like a winetaster; and then refuse to drink it.  It is equally caddish to wink and squint at the colour of a man's orchard, like a landscape painter; and then refuse to buy the apples.  It is always an insult to admire a thing and not use it.  But the main point is that one has no right to see Stonehenge without Salisbury Plain and Salisbury: One has no right to respect the dead Italians without respecting the live ones.  One has no right to visit a Christian society like a diver visiting the deep-sea fishes--fed along a lengthy tube by another atmosphere, and seeing the sights without breathing the air.  It is very real bad manners.\\n\\nTHE NEW THEOLOGIAN\\n\\nIt is an old story that names do not fit things; it is an old story that the oldest forest is called the New Forest, and that Irish stew is almost peculiar to England.  But these are traditional titles that tend, of their nature, to stiffen; it is the tragedy of to-day that even phrases invented for to-day do not fit it.  The forest has remained new while it is nearly a thousand years old; but our fashions have grown old while they were still new.\\n\\nThe extreme example of this is that when modern wrongs are attacked, they are almost always attacked wrongly.  People seem to have a positive inspiration for finding the inappropriate phrase to apply to an offender; they are always accusing a man of theft when he has been convicted of murder.  They must accuse Sir Edward Carson of outrageous rebellion, when his offence has really been a sleek submission to the powers that be. They must describe Mr. Lloyd George as using his eloquence to rouse the mob, whereas he has really shown considerable cleverness in damping it down.  It was probably under the same impulse towards a mysterious misfit of names that people denounced Dr. Inge as \\\"the Gloomy Dean.\\\"\\n\\nNow there is nothing whatever wrong about being a Dean; nor is there anything wrong about being gloomy.  The only question is what dark but sincere motives have made you gloomy.  What dark but sincere motives have made you a Dean.  Now the address of Dr. Inge which gained him this erroneous title was mostly concerned with a defence of the modern capitalists against the modern strikers, from whose protest he appeared to anticipate appalling results.  Now if we look at the facts about that gentleman's depression and also about his Deanery, we shall find a very curious state of things.\\n\\nWhen Dr. Inge was called \\\"the Gloomy Dean\\\" a great injustice was done him.  He had appeared as the champion of our capitalist community against the forces of revolt; and any one who does that exceeds in optimism rather than pessimism.  A man who really thinks that strikers have suffered no wrong, or that employers have done no wrong--such a man is not a Gloomy Dean, but a quite wildly and dangerously happy Dean. A man who can feel satisfied with modern industrialism must be a man with a mysterious fountain of high spirits.  And the actual occasion is not less curious; because, as far as I can make out, his title to gloom reposes on his having said that our worker's demand high wages, while the placid people of the Far East will quite cheerfully work for less.\\n\\nThis is true enough, of course, and there does not seem to be much difficulty about the matter. Men of the Far East will submit to very low wages for the same reason that they will submit to \\\"the punishment known as Li, or Slicing\\\"; for the same reason that they will praise polygamy and suicide; for the same reason that they subject the wife utterly to the husband or his parents; for the same reason that they serve their temples with prostitutes for priests; for the same reason that they sometimes seem to make no distinction between sexual passion and sexual perversion.  They do it, that is, because they are Heathens; men with traditions different from ours about the limits of endurance and the gestures of self-respect.  They may be very much better than we are in hundreds of other ways; and I can quite understand a man (though hardly a Dean) really preferring their historic virtues to those of Christendom. A man may perhaps feel more comfortable among his Asiatic coolies than among his European comrades: and as we are to allow the Broadest Thought in the Church, Dr. Inge has as much right to his heresy as anybody else. It is true that, as Dr. Inge says, there are numberless Orientals who will do a great deal of work for very little money; and it is most undoubtedly true that there are several high-placed and prosperous Europeans who like to get work done and pay as little as possible for it.\\n\\nBut I cannot make out why, with his enthusiasm for heathen habits and traditions, the Dean should wish to spread in the East the ideas which he has found so dreadfully unsettling in the West. If some thousands of years of paganism have produced the patience and industry that Dean Inge admires, and if some thousand years of Christianity have produced the sentimentality and sensationalism which he regrets, the obvious deduction is that Dean Inge would be much happier if he were a heathen Chinese. Instead of supporting Christian missions to Korea or Japan, he ought to be at the head of a great mission in London for converting the English to Taoism or Buddhism. There his passion for the moral beauties of paganism would have free and natural play; his style would improve; his mind would begin slowly to clear; and he would be free from all sorts of little irritating scrupulosities which must hamper even the most Conservative Christian in his full praise of sweating and the sack.\\n\\nIn Christendom he will never find rest.  The perpetual public criticism and public change which is the note of all our history springs from a certain spirit far too deep to be defined.  It is deeper than democracy; nay, it may often appear to be non-democratic; for it may often be the special defence of a minority or an individual.  It will often leave the ninety-and-nine in the wilderness and go after that which is lost.  It will often risk the State itself to right a single wrong; and do justice though the heavens fall.  Its highest expression is not even in the formula of the great gentlemen of the French Revolution who said that all men were free and equal.  Its highest expression is rather in the formula of the peasant who said that a man's a man for a' that.  If there were but one slave in England, and he did all the work while the rest of us made merry, this spirit that is in us would still cry aloud to God night and day.  Whether or no this spirit was produced by, it clearly works with, a creed which postulates a humanised God and a vividly personal immortality.  Men must not be busy merely like a swarm, or even happy merely like a herd; for it is not a question of men, but of a man.  A man's meals may be poor, but they must not be bestial; there must always be that about the meal which permits of its comparison to the sacrament. A man's bed may be hard, but it must not be abject or unclean: there must always be about the bed something of the decency of the death-bed.\\n\\nThis is the spirit which makes the Christian poor begin their terrible murmur whenever there is a turn of prices or a deadlock of toil that threatens them with vagabondage or pauperisation; and we cannot encourage the Dean with any hope that this spirit can be cast out.  Christendom will continue to suffer all the disadvantages of being Christian: it is the Dean who must be gently but firmly altered.  He had absent-mindedly strayed into the wrong continent and the wrong creed.  I advise him to chuck it.\\n\\nBut the case is more curious still.  To connect the Dean with Confucian temples or traditions may have appeared fantastic; but it is not.  Dr. Inge is not a stupid old Tory Rector, strict both on Church and State. Such a man might talk nonsense about the Christian Socialists being \\\"court chaplains of King Demos\\\" or about his own superb valour in defying the democracy that rages in the front pews of Anglican churches.  We should not expect a mere old-fashioned country clergyman to know that Demos has never been king in England and precious seldom anywhere else; we should not expect him to realise that if King Demos had any chaplains they would be uncommonly poorly paid.  But Dr. Inge is not old-fashioned; he considers himself highly progressive and advanced.  He is a New Theologian; that is, he is liberal in theology--and nothing else.  He is apparently in sober fact, and not as in any fantasy, in sympathy with those who would soften the superior claim of our creed by urging the rival creeds of the East; with those who would absorb the virtues of Buddhism or of Islam.  He holds a high seat in that modern Parliament of Religions where all believers respect each other's unbelief.\\n\\nNow this has a very sharp moral for modern religious reformers.  When next you hear the \\\"liberal\\\" Christian say that we should take what is best in Oriental faiths, make quite sure what are the things that people like Dr. Inge call best; what are the things that people like Dr. Inge propose to take.  You will not find them imitating the military valour of the Moslem.  You will not find them imitating the miraculous ecstasy of the Hindoo.  The more you study the \\\"broad\\\" movement of today, the more you will find that these people want something much less like Chinese metaphysics, and something much more like Chinese Labour.  You will find the levelling of creeds quite unexpectedly close to the lowering of wages. Dr. Inge is the typical latitudinarian of to-day; and was never more so than when he appeared not as the apostle of the blacks, but as the apostle of the blacklegs.  Preached, as it is, almost entirely among the prosperous and polite, our brotherhood with Buddhism or Mohammedanism practically means this--that the poor must be as meek as Buddhists, while the rich may be as ruthless as Mohammedans.  That is what they call the reunion of all religions.\\n\\nTHE ROMANTIC IN THE RAIN\\n\\nThe middle classes of modern England are quite fanatically fond of washing; and are often enthusiastic for teetotalism.  I cannot therefore comprehend why it is that they exhibit a mysterious dislike of rain. Rain, that inspiring and delightful thing, surely combines the qualities of these two ideals with quite a curious perfection.  Our philanthropists are eager to establish public baths everywhere.  Rain surely is a public bath; it might almost be called mixed bathing.  The appearance of persons coming fresh from this great natural lustration is not perhaps polished or dignified; but for the matter of that, few people are dignified when coming out of a bath.  But the scheme of rain in itself is one of an enormous purification.  It realises the dream of some insane hygienist: it scrubs the sky.  Its giant brooms and mops seem to reach the starry rafters and Starless corners of the cosmos; it is a cosmic spring- cleaning.\\n\\nIf the Englishman is really fond of cold baths, he ought not to grumble at the English climate for being a cold bath.  In these days we are constantly told that we should leave our little special possessions and join in the enjoyment of common social institutions and a common social machinery.  I offer the rain as a thoroughly Socialistic institution.  It disregards that degraded delicacy which has hitherto led each gentleman to take his shower-bath in private.  It is a better shower-bath, because it is public and communal; and, best of all, because somebody else pulls the string.\\n\\nAs for the fascination of rain for the water drinker, it is a fact the neglect of which I simply cannot comprehend.  The enthusiastic water drinker must regard a rainstorm as a sort of universal banquet and debauch of his own favourite beverage.  Think of the imaginative intoxication of the wine drinker if the crimson clouds sent down claret or the golden clouds hock.  Paint upon primitive darkness some such scenes of apocalypse, towering and gorgeous skyscapes in which champagne falls like fire from heaven or the dark skies grow purple and tawny with the terrible colours of port.  All this must the wild abstainer feel, as he rolls in the long soaking grass, kicks his ecstatic heels to heaven, and listens to the roaring rain.  It is he, the water drinker, who ought to be the true bacchanal of the forests; for all the forests are drinking water.  Moreover, the forests are apparently enjoying it: the trees rave and reel to and fro like drunken giants; they clash boughs as revellers clash cups; they roar undying thirst and howl the health of the world.\",\"timestamp\":1636956872,\"title\":\"My friend was (and is) a Radical, but he was (and is) an Englishman, and it never occurred to him that there could be any harm in singing archaic lyrics out of remote centuries; tha\\n\"},\"digest\":\"Pc3HjwT5H79L2J5BJs-3WbKZw-yKzqLF-je8iX-DTWI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf28A2beF877448182B07e1C9bF1b10753381B9EA\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qlJ4kFHU5yYWCsqewHfg4ZqpCL-3ozZPtODH34tonzg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mxwP4xpl3bwD31dUe6kwJ3N2es8JhlnKxtQCGu4Pgvs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MRUpdHtzw_7HmAsl0IMasvNgleyOQC__Oufk1mIPBk7eSTsSBLvbKZIbDEOIv779pCHXP_kE_OgAaATDsnvlIw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x94b4afc6be34b7d4ab3b0018e1a863b5db83240a53fc6b0238cc3b7d70a977604b8305ebe723c80a3af4d6f4deffd5a2791638552f393ca9d3f882b5eabe72731b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"qlJ4kFHU5yYWCsqewHfg4ZqpCL-3ozZPtODH34tonzg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mxwP4xpl3bwD31dUe6kwJ3N2es8JhlnKxtQCGu4Pgvs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Pc3HjwT5H79L2J5BJs-3WbKZw-yKzqLF-je8iX-DTWI\"}"
