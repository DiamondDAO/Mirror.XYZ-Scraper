"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"People have always asked us: What is the most important aspect that makes Web3 superior to any other Era of the Web before? The answer is both simple and complex: Communities.\\n\\n**Communities are the building blocks for Web3.** They can empower the individual and they can achieve things that were thought to be impossible not too long ago. Where Web2 focused on products and users, Web3 returns to the roots of the Internet movement by focusing on Humans and how they come together as collectives to form communities. But communities are not all the same, and they don’t necessarily translate to strong social ties or movements.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lXikc83WjVyZKp_r8c_x_.png?height=933&width=1400)\\n\\nCommunities can be made up of weak ties, people that come together for a shared goal but do not share any meaningful social connections, rarely interacting with the community unless its for their own gain. In sociology, we call these communities secondary social groups. Primary social groups on the other hand, are communities that share common characteristics (for example, a common goal or social categories like age, preferences, etc.) but even more importantly, they interact with the community and work together to achieve their shared goal.\\n\\nAs the story of Web3 unfolds, we see only the latter kind of communities will have a long lasting impact on the overall direction of the Blockchain Space. Communities with a shared vision and a strong alignment towards executing on this vision are making incredible things happen. They are the living proof of why Web3 will eventually succeed over the incumbents of Web2. Since these communities can work together and get all of their members involved, both in the creative and the development process, as well as the process of growth through word of mouth; what makes these communities special is the shared ownership and shared responsibility that each and every member of the community has. It does not end with a formal team or a company building a product or service, it really only starts with them.\\n\\nThis brings us to the topic of today, which as you might have guessed is: Community. Community stands at the center of all our efforts in building both the Centuries Collective as a force of change for the industry, as well as for the organizations and platforms that will be seeded by Centuries.\\n\\n**To leverage the power of our Community we need to come together to find ways to make our community members an active part instead of a passive part of the development process.** We will have thousands of members waiting for every new update and every new product we release. But that is an approach of the past. Our community is not going to just stand by and wait, they will be an active force in the process itself.\\n\\nHow will that play out? As we have seen over the recent weeks, there is an incredible amount of people that are already trying to participate in some capacity and that want to contribute their skills to make the community stronger and make the projects we work on better. This contribution can come in a variety of ways and capacities. For example, an independent artist using their creativity to help us connect with our community through music, visual art, cinematography, or by other means. Through their efforts, they can create value for the community and in return, the community gives them exposure and a place to share their creative efforts.\\n\\nBut art is not the only way to contribute. We have been approached by programmers and developers with all kinds of experiences, skills, and backgrounds. From web and front-end development to back-end, distributed ledger, and database development. No matter if you have experience in creating beautiful user experiences, or are a data genius that builds efficient databases or that collects unique insights by doing data analysis and data engineering — all of those are skills that can improve our products and bring value to our community.\\n\\nHowever, it does not end there. You might be wondering: I am neither an artist nor do I have any skills or experience in programming, but I still want to contribute and help the community, what can I do? There really is an endless amount of things that need to be done and that will bring value to the community. From translating our products into a language you are fluent in to help others get easier access, or to being an active part in the community itself by helping new members find the information they need by sharing knowledge with others. In the end, you are playing an important part in our community.\\n\\nTake a second to think about what you could do for others and how your unique set of skills could benefit the community. Because if the community gets stronger, so do you as an individual. **The magic about Web3 is that we can all benefit from each other if we pull on the same string.** It is not about maximizing individual gains — one person could never create as much value as a community of people that are aligned behind a powerful vision.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SD13SrVRYeiZtRscybq3b.png?height=1749&width=1400)\\n\\nGoing into our post-launch we will know exactly who our community members are. They are going to be the holders of our collection, as well as individual contributors from the outside that are doing their best to become part of the community. We are open for everyone to participate, and everyone who participates will reap the rewards that will come from making our vision a reality.\\n\\nTo our team, which will lead the efforts on making this reality come true, it was always clear that we will not be able to do everything alone. **Only with a strong community we can leverage the true power of Web3.** Which is why we will have a mix of individual volunteers from inside the community as well as people from the outside that might initially join for monetary rewards but will slowly become part of the bigger community.\\n\\nThe funds we raise through our first Centuries Collection will be the catalyst that will help us get off the ground and that will allows us to maintain community ownership, without having to give substantial control to outside investors whose goals might not be aligned with those of the community. It will allow us to hire specialists from the outside that will bring the necessary expertise and engineering experience to build our vision of a more connected Web3 space where the community themselves own the means of production and stays in control of their connections, relationships, and assets.\\n\\nBut we will not just hire specialists from the outside. We will also hire from within our community. Those who make the biggest contribution and show the biggest commitment will become an official part of our team. All the other smaller contributors will be rewarded for their help and time as well.\\n\\nWe hope this demonstrates to everyone both the opportunities, as well as the responsibility that each and every member of the community has in making a difference. Alone, we are weak and small, but together, we can achieve incredible things. That is the true power of community. It is what will allow us to make a real impact and to show everyone else that our passion and commitment are more powerful than even the biggest Giants of Web2. They might have unlimited capital, and armies of employees and talent, but they lack shared ownership and meaningful connections. Their power comes from control. They never asked for permission, they just took that control as their sacred right. The reality is most of them do not deserve that control — they are not building for communities but for shareholders, these two groups rarely align. It is time to take that control back and show them that we have a voice, and that we are not happy with how they have been using their power.\\n\\n**It is in our hands to make the future better than the past — but we can only do it together.**\",\"timestamp\":1642641744,\"title\":\"The Power of Community\"},\"digest\":\"hNMAMxREPi64GKmQ8hWEN6p5mI9lz1gVjqKatXaBeBQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA0125FDcb3e65A2cEaDF459B8d4454167eC51D7E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-nOFWbkoK9PSLA3JDGRX-wnsCUbJymikqvelk-BkrdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_r3lsgwQAf_faUv6tkrWGThd1jGAREcBaAehkGlbg2Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"u65UU0P_-gn3sOGZu8wNi47K2TVvigzVnjm-hiuP8gd3e2d4TN234XKcmDfYlP-2zoZR4vri1Zw6eXxXPZX8Ig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9e868e13b03919aa7bb14a324934ade02f141ff34c3832628a7251b1f53959e439822cbf823013c789f1a73c0946eae86ae0434369d0307ee7b367ed7fa426b11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-nOFWbkoK9PSLA3JDGRX-wnsCUbJymikqvelk-BkrdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_r3lsgwQAf_faUv6tkrWGThd1jGAREcBaAehkGlbg2Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"hNMAMxREPi64GKmQ8hWEN6p5mI9lz1gVjqKatXaBeBQ\"}"
