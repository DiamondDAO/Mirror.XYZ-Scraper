"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Over the last 12 months, I’ve tried to boil down my goals to their most basic form through [first-principles thinking](https://fs.blog/first-principles/). In doing this, it became clear that *consistently increasing the quality of my interaction with others* was the foundation to better health, stronger personal relationships, and an increasingly fulfilling career. I know, this sounds obvious at first…but my objective was to come up with a clear and simple mental model that would simplify this pursuit. This was a tougher ask and required much deeper thought and self-reflection. Ultimately, I came up with the **VIP Framework**, where V = **Value**, I = **Impact**, and P = **Positivity**.\\n\\nThese are the key points at the core of the VIP Framework:\\n\\n**Value:** How can I bring the most value to every interaction? The answer to this question will vary depending on the situation and baseline expectations. We must deeply understand those we are trying to serve and prepare accordingly. A quote from best-selling author Robin Sharma captures this well: *“Be viscerally on fire to bring value to a massive number of people. The one who helps the most wins”.*\\n\\n**Impact:** How can I help others achieve their most important goals? The value we bring to others must be aligned to their priorities. True impact requires action in the right direction. The fastest car in the world would be of no value without a steering wheel. As one of my first mentors used to say: “*Activity without results is meaningless.*”  \\n\\n**Positivity:** Do people feel hopeful or fearful after they interact with me? Being a pessimist is easy, but optimists are much more likely to change the world. Never forget that 55% of human communication is nonverbal. It’s about *what* you say, but also *how* you say it. Bringing the right energy is paramount.  \\n\\nThis framework has become my operating system in 2021. I have experienced firsthand how the focus on *high-quality interactions* has led to better results in all areas of my life. I intend to write a longer-form article to elaborate on each of the three elements above, but I wanted to share my initial thoughts on this short post as I’ve received unsolicited feedback from dozens of people who have highlighted how much this model has helped them.\\n\\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the VIP Framework, check out [my interview](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carsonvheady_performance-sales-value-activity-6767104282866139136-zWSk) with author Carson Heady.\",\"timestamp\":1640797989,\"title\":\"Reach 2022 Goals with the VIP Framework\"},\"digest\":\"o8_LzdwfLV_HJeVCZWCZkpouEt4Lps-MrqZZcFtoR_g\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4104b440ec1F234Df3FFebD2FA400f89B7117b22\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FJSOJ1NnyejAb8uBIH-K8GQFG-Gqgje-DHfhsScu49M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kd_LYFGC-Av9XEiYZyroxEv2ESM6oD9_iWiML2FeKOQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dvoibXwZFDjZuKrsGm5r1-67aDoHj5uG0E6OT5DE7FpF-QVl5NMcpq1zu5n1eM0xIWHG6RmA0dM6unUlbXgNPw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9587710e8462f5b944f51ff3440cc8bf8a119c6c553affad3eb09fc53194a0351e79bac80941b5f2ef2725401f7536bc22e08454175d63bf2cad789b8f03ff541b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FJSOJ1NnyejAb8uBIH-K8GQFG-Gqgje-DHfhsScu49M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kd_LYFGC-Av9XEiYZyroxEv2ESM6oD9_iWiML2FeKOQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6Y-wMkXaFLqU2jbDGsnR2EYpV2vf6bYgCtk2fqsODSs\"}"
