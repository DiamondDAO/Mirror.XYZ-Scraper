"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The boss must learn to transfer the contradiction to the team, don't ignite the fire, break up the hilltopism in the team, and break up the small teams in the team. In this way, the talents of the entire team are obedient. Easy to manage!\\n\\nFor example, give rewards to team members, or invite everyone to eat out together, the rewards are all\\n\\nThe same, the same is true for eating, so the team members will only comment together that the reward is not up to the level, whether the meal is good or not, and when it's done, just wipe it with your mouth and eat it for nothing. If it breaks, I scold the boss for stinging. They will automatically unite against the boss, which is why many bosses treat their employees kindly, and the employees are still dissatisfied.\\n\\nPeople are inherently different. If you treat every employee equally, you, the boss, are unfair.\\n\\nAnd if you divide the reward into several parts of different sizes, let them discuss for themselves who should get more and who should get less. They will discuss with each other who deserves more credit and who deserves less credit, and they will attack each other and compare each other. At this time, the smart ones of them will also ask the boss to make a decision, so that team members will not fight against the boss. . They themselves have turned themselves into a mess.\\n\\nAnd if the boss only rewards a few people, then they will compete with each other for this reward.\\n\\nTo be a boss, you must know these methods, instead of just knowing to be a good person, then starting a business or doing a business will basically end in failure.\",\"timestamp\":1634794909,\"title\":\"The boss must learn to transfer conflicts to the team\"},\"digest\":\"awSRlyjQLFDgNXiW5fJ8Ze4MZc58HeyjCKTI3a_SB1s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nisxrx2l8zR2NSD0xk-p1-QNQicXMfY9v7a-73LjVikb1yszN4oSO4UV7tmx9S5Hzrir3cW8C0E7mHnY-SMG-w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"awSRlyjQLFDgNXiW5fJ8Ze4MZc58HeyjCKTI3a_SB1s\"}"
