"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Cheese** is a [dairy product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dairy_product) and produced in wide ranges of flavors, [textures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouthfeel) and forms by [coagulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coagulation_(milk)) of the milk protein [casein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein). It comprises [proteins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) and [fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat) from milk, usually the milk of [cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cows), [buffalo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_buffalo), [goats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat), or [sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_milk). During production, the milk is usually [acidified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid) and the enzymes of either [rennet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rennet) or bacterial enzymes with similar activity are added to cause the casein to coagulate. The solid [curds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curd) are then separated from the liquid [whey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whey) and pressed into finished cheese.[\\\\[1\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese#cite_note-1) Some cheeses have aromatic [molds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mold_(fungus)) on the rind, the outer layer, or throughout. Most cheeses melt at cooking temperature.\\n\\nOver a thousand [types of cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_cheese) exist and are currently produced in various countries. Their styles, textures and flavors depend on the origin of the milk (including the animal's diet), whether they have been [pasteurized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurized), the [butterfat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfat) content, the [bacteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteria) and [mold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus), the processing, and how long they have been [aged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_ripening) for. [Herbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb), [spices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spice), or [wood smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoking_(cooking)) may be used as [flavoring agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavoring_agent). The yellow to red color of many cheeses is produced by adding [annatto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annatto). Other ingredients may be added to some cheeses, such as [black pepper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_pepper), [garlic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garlic), [chives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chives) or [cranberries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry). A **cheesemonger**, or specialist seller of cheeses, may have expertise with selecting the cheeses, purchasing, receiving, storing and ripening them.[\\\\[2\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese#cite_note-2)\\n\\nFor a few cheeses, the milk is [curdled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curd) by adding [acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid) such as [vinegar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinegar) or [lemon juice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemon_juice). Most cheeses are acidified to a lesser degree by bacteria, which turn [milk sugars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_sugar) into [lactic acid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactic_acid), then the addition of rennet completes the curdling. [Vegetarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetarian) alternatives to rennet are available; most are produced by [fermentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermentation) of the [fungus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus) *[Mucor miehei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mucor_miehei)*, but others have been extracted from various species of the *[Cynara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynara)* thistle family. [Cheesemakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesemaker) near a dairy region may benefit from fresher, lower-priced milk, and lower shipping costs.\\n\\nCheese is valued for its portability, long [shelf life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelf_life), and high content of [fat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat), [protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein), [calcium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium), and [phosphorus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus). Cheese is more compact and has a longer shelf life than milk, although how long a cheese will keep depends on the type of cheese.[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese#cite_note-johnson2017-3) [Hard cheeses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_cheese), such as [Parmesan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmesan), last longer than soft cheeses, such as [Brie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brie) or [goat's milk cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_cheese). The long storage life of some cheeses, especially when encased in a protective rind, allows selling when markets are favorable. [Vacuum packaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_packaging) of block-shaped cheeses and [gas-flushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas-flushing) of plastic bags with mixtures of [carbon dioxide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) and [nitrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen) are used for storage and [mass distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_distribution) of cheeses in the [21st century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21st_century).[\\\\[3\\\\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese#cite_note-johnson2017-3)\",\"timestamp\":1639489495,\"title\":\"Test Coinbase Wallet\"},\"digest\":\"u7lFVr5WTc3W8naz1BMZxeJPpYayJUKH-WOJKy8WMWo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa72164Bc2c50Ca339166Ff621e9A6ceD6384B661\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rxfAeDOT-mJ4roC_7MSBbYvCzoql2fy1MaiohVCKWA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"z67g50bYDQaqLjQ318kRqsEiItw0nurY3Sjjrp1rXZU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fmhvb5AFEw7AAehzoTpmyDSoJph5uopb2MQvAxYYLVbHNNc3_XlGYst2navLHt7iYmKcBdfKY5V3rVynONghIQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5d47921769889f0079a9dfd3c25f318b0233da2e48bb6775f10026d346aa1444725b65e0410895f1dad988db9945542c115d4ed8cdc7008750f98f53570e633f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"rxfAeDOT-mJ4roC_7MSBbYvCzoql2fy1MaiohVCKWA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"z67g50bYDQaqLjQ318kRqsEiItw0nurY3Sjjrp1rXZU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"u7lFVr5WTc3W8naz1BMZxeJPpYayJUKH-WOJKy8WMWo\"}"
