"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"How can we remember if we just read without remembering? The understanding and memory that can be achieved by subconscious and passive acceptance is obviously limited, and the information in the book will really become our knowledge only after conscious chewing and independent processing.\\n\\nMany people do not do reading notes, either because they do not know how to do, or is too time-consuming and laborious.\\n\\nThere are many ready-made templates for reading notes on the Internet, and I have combined the strengths of several versions, which are currently used as follows.\\n\\\\- Information (author, publisher, year of publication, number of pages, author's bio, reading start and end dates)\\n\\\\- Tags (i.e. keywords) - easy to retrieve later\\n\\\\- Value (overall rating, 1-10) - a reference indicator for whether to recommend\\n\\\\- Outline (list the important parts of the book in order) - can copy the table of contents or draw up your own outline\\n\\\\- Theme (briefly explain what the book is about, main ideas) - summarize in one sentence yourself\\n\\\\- Comments (reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with the author's views + what the book has taught me) - the key to remembering the book\\n\\\\- Memorization (excerpts from the best) - easy to quote later\\n\\\\- Related (other people's great book reviews, mind maps or PPTs) - as a backup for additional information\\n\\nA quick note. The first 4 of these items are all basic information that can be copied and pasted in 5 minutes.\\nThe 5th topic is similar to summarizing the central idea in elementary school. As long as you have refined it in one sentence, you will be able to present it concisely to others next time.\\n\\nThe 6th item, your own commentary, is the most critical part. But everything that is written down in your head, basically will not forget. A book is good, what is good, which points of the author touches you the most, whether you agree with it, and what kind of inspiration it has for you. All of these can become the content of the book review.\\n\\nIf it is a very watery book or a general novel, write a brief review of one or two hundred words. If it is of some value, I will write at least three points. For example, when I read Qian Mu's \\\"China's political gains and losses through the ages,\\\" I spent half an hour summarizing the three main values of reading history: piercing the illusion of history, breaking the superstition of the system, and recognizing the laws of progress, spending two to three hundred words on each point. Even if you don't remember the other aspects, later on, at least these three points can be shared with others in words.\\n\\nThe seventh excerpt, usually more time-consuming, people are too lazy to do. Here we recommend several pro-tested programs.\\n\\n(1) e-books are recommended to read with Kindle. No matter how much I still love paper books, since I bought the nibble bean gods, or by its lightweight completely subdued. The infinite number of books in the palm of your hand, that at any time and anywhere can be Borges said heaven - life without a Kindle is not worth living!\\n\\nKindle can be read while marking (Highlight), and then with Clippings, you can categorize these marked sentences by title, and export them to Impressions or Word documents in a second.\\n\\nIt's so convenient and time-saving that it's really touching! This is how you can do all the excerpts in 10,000 words. Specific operation see this link: <http://kindlefere.com/post/20.html> (cell phone open sometimes can not be fully displayed, it is recommended to use the computer to access)\\n\\n(2) paper books, while reading can be underlined, plus some key or star symbols marked, you can also write their own commentary in the margins, but these excerpts after the best electronic. There are several options as follows.\\n\\nA. Use online ready-made resources. There are excerpts of notes in Douban Reading, which are very efficient to filter and copy directly. If you are handy, you can finish a book in about half an hour. Although time saving, but the memory effect is poor, need to revisit later to review. In addition, according to the different tastes of people's finishing and appreciation, some sentences will be repeatedly organized, and some sentences will be missed.\\n\\nB. Use voice input software such as Xunfei. Read through the excerpted sentences in turn, 90% of the content can be accurately converted into text, after which punctuation and identification of misspelled words and then spend some time to change them. Time cost and memory effect is more balanced.\\n\\nC. Typing and finishing once by yourself. The time cost is higher, but the memory effect is best.\\n\\nD. Personally, I don't like to use Tu Book Notes, I can only share one note, which is not conducive to unification, and it is not convenient to search and export.\\n\\nThe 8th item is other related resources can be used as a supplement, especially some good diagrams and PPT. of course, you can also do it yourself, the effect is more very good, but accordingly spend more time. But the gains and losses are always matched, others organize the posting to remember ten times, the effect may not be as good as their own personal processing to do once.\\n\\nAfter reading a book, you have to take notes, which seems to be a lot of work on the surface. But through the optimization of tools, a book in addition to the review of the time can be controlled within 1 hour, plus book reviews 2 hours is enough. And once accumulated, it becomes its own database. In the future, not only to revisit a book will become efficient and easy, but also to write articles cited at your fingertips. So this investment is still extremely cost effective.\\n\\nThe truths learned from the book can also be actively shared with others. The essence of reading is still listening to others, the story is always someone else's. Only if you take the initiative to sell, that will internalize into their own. Last year, after listening to those things in the Ming Dynasty, several principles of the unity of knowledge and action are extremely loved, and once you have the opportunity to speak tirelessly to various people, recited three or five times, want to forget are difficult.\\n\\nSlowly pick up sesame seeds word by word, be careful of losing the watermelon\\n\\nOnce you encounter a good book, many serious partners are the same as me, can't wait to break each sentence into eight pieces, rubbed eat through, afraid to miss a little essence. As a result, the sesame seeds finally picked up a basket, but therefore lead to read very slowly, and later on can not remember what was said in front, it is difficult to grasp the most central point of view and the whole book pulse.\\n\\nTao Yuanming reading \\\"do not seek to understand\\\", Zhuge Liang used to \\\"view its overview\\\", we must not expect to squeeze a book dry at once.\\n\\nFirst, in case it is a very watery book, reading it carefully is too much of a loss.\\n\\nSecond, even if it is a good book, not every part is the essence. According to the law of twenty-eight, 80% of the value is created by 20% of the content.\\n\\nThird, the benefit-time ratio of squeezing only once is not as efficient as squeezing a few more times.\\n\\nFourth, no matter how carefully you read the first time, it is impossible to squeeze 100% dry. Without macro understanding, the absorption of details will be discounted.\\n\\nSo be sure to maintain a basic pace and speed of reading, feasible approaches include.\\n\\n(1) Macroscopic perspective\\n\\nWhen you decide that it is not the decisive 20% but the less important 80%, you don't have to understand it all, but can generally understand it. In this way, you will not dwell on the difficulties and inefficiencies of reading a particular page or pages.\\n\\n(2) Clear focus\\n\\nReading inefficiencies often occur when you are drowsy or distracted, so you can remind yourself by setting a time and number of pages. Setting a tomato clock, getting up and standing up to read, etc. can help keep you awake and focused. Unless the book is particularly difficult, I generally try to make sure that 1 page per minute, 2 tomato clocks (1 hour) per day can complete 60 pages, an average of 1 week a book should be fine. If it is a relatively easy book, you should do 80-100 pages in 1 hour. You can read about 2 books a week.\\n\\n(3) Easy first, then difficult\\n\\nIf the first book is too boring, it will not only be a slow read, but may also ruin the interest in exploring this area. Last year, I was very interested in Zeng Guofan, and I first read \\\"Zeng Wenzhenggong Jiayin Ban\\\" compiled by Liang Qichao, which was full of literary language, although it was equipped with a translation, but because I didn't know anything about Zeng Gong's life experience, and I didn't know anything about the background and characters of many good words, I had a hard time reading it. Later, my girlfriend recommended Tang Haoming's \\\"Zeng Guofan\\\". Although the three-volume book has more than 1,000 pages, the historical novel is a good read, and I was able to figure out the life history, main events and related characters of Wenzheng Gong in 10 days. At this point, I went back to \\\"JiaYinBao\\\" and finished reading it in 2 days, and realized the beauty of it.\\n\\nIf you want to read it once and remember it, do you think you are Hatoma Ji?\\n\\nAt the beginning of the year, when I read \\\"Three Thousand Years in Jerusalem\\\", there was a wide range of historical figures, but unfortunately I had never heard of any of them. I couldn't figure out what King David, Herod's family and Saladin were, even though the author had told me so well.\\n\\nI remember Jerusalem is very sad, the original repair of a temple is very noble, the results of the various religions are fighting for this piece of treasure, to make it scarred. The deepest grievances are Christianity and Islam, these two can fight, the Jews really poor.\\nThere are also Arabs, Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks in the Middle East and Europe you and me, what relationship between them, read or full of confusion. At that time, I really thought I had read for nothing.\\n\\nAs a result, recently read the \\\"History of Western Philosophy\\\", talking about the medieval philosophy of the Academy, look at the historical figures of Christianity and Islam at the time of the struggle, suddenly feel friendly, from time to time pop up a name seems to be very familiar. And then re-listen to Luo fat talk about the road to the Jewish Restoration, some history can be strung together.\\n\\nSo, read and remember, often because we opened a new field of knowledge, the past accumulation of their own in this area is too little.\\nSince we are not prodigies, there are only two paths.\\n\\n(1) good books to reread\\n\\n(2) Do thematic reading\\n\\nSome people say that they can't get through what they haven't read, so how can they have time to read old books? So many new areas have not been touched, but still on the old topic in a circle, it is not guilty?\\n\\nLast year, a best-selling book \\\"Rereading\\\" had a waistband that said: \\\"The only way to really read is to reread. I don't entirely agree with this statement, but my experience is indeed that ideas and information are mostly not memorized at once, and require not only memorization and forgetting like memorizing a text, but also multiple perspectives of perception, familiarity and understanding. The first time can only leave a little hazy impression like pepper spray, and then again when the concept can be formed as a knowledge fulcrum, read more books around the subject, repeatedly reinforced to form even out the logical clues.\\n\\nAs for how to do theme reading, I suggest you move to see \\\"how to read a book\\\", the absolute best in reading methodology, a hundred times clearer than I speak. When you select and read at least 10 books around a certain topic, you can form a basic knowledge framework and system in this field, and then read again to get the information can be quickly categorized and integrated into the established system, and naturally remember it.\\n\\nThe truth is that some people seem to be unforgettable.\",\"timestamp\":1639289379,\"title\":\"The key of note taking\"},\"digest\":\"ndEsvaJ2iEhr25NCK_eR8OngzxyOX4rUYtNj0ORUUUo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nfoG-CW606K4AadbGslUGcioPZ4-b0kK_uObgVsc2q0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V1m2-uFUqezX5i_liRFLTisOqXegZo4bDnBIokhWi9A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"3BY8w-t6whTrF8oLqoDTY24VzFgXXU59CCtUIQSSUfxzgwfRVT5nwQ2vNCambraxmnjo5ZUZRnNeKP_oSTNPUg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7764069a1a9d93366617eca68c4ca060e5f1166ab33dabc329cb61ebbb47d3f63a1afe7c37fbc1a2d2fee6051297eb48ad17c13afcc1d81c49950b56a76412721b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nfoG-CW606K4AadbGslUGcioPZ4-b0kK_uObgVsc2q0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"V1m2-uFUqezX5i_liRFLTisOqXegZo4bDnBIokhWi9A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ndEsvaJ2iEhr25NCK_eR8OngzxyOX4rUYtNj0ORUUUo\"}"
