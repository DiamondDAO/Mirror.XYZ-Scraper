"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Why are we here?\\n\\nWe believe artists lead culture. Their creativity and their vision are what help us sense-make as we progress our understanding of the world around us. Artists help us communicate complex ideas before we have the right words. They help us see the path ahead.\\n\\nWe love artists and want more of them to exist as artists in the world. This is the promise of web3.\\n\\nWe love collecting art and see cryptographic tokens as a way to do what we love while helping artists achieve financial freedom. Web3 requires zero compromise. Tokens are extremely innovative artist development tools. NFTs provide artists the opportunity to find their voice and communicate more clearly.\\n\\nPhlote is built amplify phenoms. We’re the ghostwriters, ghostproducers, ghosttalent that makes everything around you better, sometimes without anyone knowing it.  We make the suggestion so early it feels like intuition. We show you what’s coming next. We invest in quality art and the artists who make it. We support exceptional talent. \\n\\nWe will power an indie artists to a Grammy. We will sell an mp3 for $2 million. We will seed and help grow some of the world’s first global art super brands. The roadmap is there.\\n\\nThey say Web3 enables us to realign around shared values and goals, so here’s who we really are. Phlote is a community of givers. We believe great art transcends. And exist to help lead a global art revolution using crypto. \\n\\nWe're here to free the artists.\\n\\nHow do we do that?\\n\\nWe’re trying to figure it out and our thoughts are evolving.  But the goal is clear. A more creative world is a better one. So we’ll use this platform and others to free artists using crypto. We feel that anyone who believes their life’s work is valuable, would document it as an archive. So this  This goes for artists of all kinds. We must always also strive to show our future selves just how naive we were. \\n\\nOne day, we’ll all be much smarter, so today, I just want to show little we know. \",\"timestamp\":1632101666,\"title\":\"Hello World\",\"publication\":\"phlote\"},\"digest\":\"EKd_coDL-VGW39Vw9yLf4co5aR6n0yfZpDJ6YxSJq0E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEf58304E292fBAeacFdeC25b67b3438031FdE313\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ssst8sQaaHNa4Xf3jU_815iiPrt6uYOJTFDqIGorhhY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MOvC20qSEV0VOFPDpl-ax4jKLlHaWiY0Bt0ziSl3eQY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2xJ71TKx_Nn8ui1yiwyNln-QqbStceY1lGjfQkFfb6R_HsLOiSL-UC94rRd033krJPZgkMnCqiEPtEisVG3OSQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd5aa6a1645439f6974c904790e89cfbad0375a03d7c8e6a28295cbba28c738812cc385284ce4efe4cbcabbbc80c586a5c2a89fc800ff6b4c8b32d901b5179fb31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on phlote.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ssst8sQaaHNa4Xf3jU_815iiPrt6uYOJTFDqIGorhhY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MOvC20qSEV0VOFPDpl-ax4jKLlHaWiY0Bt0ziSl3eQY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RzPvnxUMmsWXzw9MALtY2NnMqDxYhZvNUhPghKoprSk\"}"
