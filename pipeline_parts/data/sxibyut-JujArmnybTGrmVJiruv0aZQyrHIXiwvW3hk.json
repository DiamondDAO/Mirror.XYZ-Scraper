"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Loot is a project that allows anyone to mint an NFT representing a set of 8 adventurer-themed gear items. These items have scarcity characteristics that are randomly distributed.\\n\\nIt is called a \\\"fair mint\\\" project, because the contract does not sell the NFTs - they are free to mint. Only 8,000 tokens can be minted in total, and the creator has reserved 222 of them for themselves as a reward (these tokens have the same scarcity distribution as everyone else's). All tokens have already been claimed.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, over 9k ETH (\\\\~$30 million) of Loot volume has traded on OpenSea's secondary market, with a floor price of 5.5 ETH each - making it one of the highest market cap collectibles of all time.\\n\\nIncluded with each token are 8 types of gear items:\\n\\n* Weapons\\n* Chest Armor\\n* Head Armor\\n* Waist Armor\\n* Foot Armor\\n* Hand Armor\\n* Necklaces\\n* Rings\\n\\nTo produce randomized scarcity, each item may be augmented by a prefix or suffix based on a hash of your token ID. There is a 42% chance of a suffix, and an 8.7% chance of a prefix.\\n\\nOne prefix might be \\\"Spirit Song\\\", and a suffix might be \\\"of Protection\\\" - combining with a \\\"Titanium Ring\\\" item to form: \\\"Spirit Titanium Ring of Protection\\\" (which would be very rare). Here's what a full set might look like:\\n\\n![An example of Loot items](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7fec08d4-9ad2-4a23-96bf-0e0301373a70.png?height=506&width=1012)\\n\\nThe names of the items are simply output as SVG in an image - as seen in the example above.\\n\\n## Claiming Tokens\\n\\nThere is no user interface for Loot, and there is no price to mint. People claim Loot by calling a function directly on the contract - usually [through Etherscan](https://www.notion.so/b16263c61d017ee9f65c50e4ae0113d7).\\n\\nBecause the claim functionality does not have sybil resistance, it is easy to mint many tokens via a script. Anish Agnihotri wrote [a script](https://www.notion.so/099274992e263a420aab49a46d2bf5b7) to do this (and likely has used it to claim many loot tokens), which is something to be aware of when considering the ownership distribution of this project.\\n\\n## Random Trait Attribution\\n\\nMinting the NFT assigns the owner a token ID, and trait attribution happens deterministically whenever NFT's tokenURI method is called.\\n\\nTrait randomization is random but deterministic. It uses a hashing function applied to the concatenation of the token's ID and the type of the item (e.g. \\\"CHEST\\\"), and converts this to an integer (`uint256` in Solidity). Each type of item has an array of options, and this integer is used to pluck a random item from those arrays.\\n\\nOnce an item is found, a new random integer is produced, bounded between 0 and 21, by taking the modulus of the random number and 21. If the new number is greater than 14 (about 42% chance), then the item gets a special suffix. If it is greater or equal to 19 (about a 8.7% chance), then it gets a prefix. This creates special scarcity properties for each of the items!\\n\\n## Closing Thoughts\\n\\nSome of the top creators in our industry have started creating interoperable games using Loot as a foundation. This is likely the start of a phenomenon in the NFT space.\\n\\nIt would be preferable to prevent sybil attacks when claiming - by only allowing one person to claim one token - since the distribution of ownership is certain to be extremely weighted towards a few technical or ETH-wealthy individuals.\\n\\nThis project has created life-changing wealth for many people who simply took the time to submit a simple Ethereum transaction. This points to the massive opportunity for everyone in space right now.\",\"timestamp\":1630470162,\"title\":\"Loot\",\"publication\":\"g\"},\"digest\":\"6IQaR7u_e1QIRLCdwwc6QubAVf5_j6Axz7rCQLK2Sao\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xCC65fA278B917042822538c44ba10AD646824026\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RFEDYmSKZ1sOYmb2SdUYHOjmyiRYVzBdVqwfPgbCZL8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UM9fl67QqugARIkSR_cRL0nSqMCqI04TY-PWxxI5N0Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"RxTCutBC77ZOiOZbWk0IZowmScUGpJ9FOrlQtSomo-BakntPyVhzQit-SMg_vEWb7ZnP_8zCC-AsI_TMNx2luw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x81063e6ab32bad121cd7f19539a2a7e5041164163b91293464cd429a590115e34a452e1d6a7376b5d17f283705c079b59e9df26be7c812ea186b7902547512661c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on g.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RFEDYmSKZ1sOYmb2SdUYHOjmyiRYVzBdVqwfPgbCZL8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UM9fl67QqugARIkSR_cRL0nSqMCqI04TY-PWxxI5N0Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"p3rjG4buPGWdu6LyWW30qfIzzQJw50wWNglPFdByPvE\"}"
