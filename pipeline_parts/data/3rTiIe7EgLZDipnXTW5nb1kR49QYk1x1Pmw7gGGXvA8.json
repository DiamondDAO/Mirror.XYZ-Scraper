"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The little choir now sung a service, King in F. They sung \\\"The Magnificat\\\" rudely, and rather profanely, but recovered themselves in the \\\"Dimittis.\\\"\\n\\nWhen it was over, Ina whispered, \\\"'To be a light to lighten the Gentiles.' That is an inspired duet. Oh, how it might be sung!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course it might,\\\" whispered Vizard; \\\"so you have something to get well for.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my friend--thanks to you and your sainted mother.\\\"\\n\\nThis, uttered in a voice which, under the healing influence of music, seemed to have regained some of its rich melody, was too much for our cynic, and he bustled off to hide his emotion, and invited the musicians to lunch.\\n\\nAll the servants had been listening on the stairs, and the hospitable old butler plied the boys with sparkling Moselle, which, being himself reared on mighty Port; he thought a light and playful wine--just the thing for women and children. So after luncheon they sung rather wild, and the Klosking told Vizard, dryly, that would do for the present.\\n\\nThen he ordered the carriage for them, and asked Mademoiselle Klosking when she would like them again.\\n\\n\\\"When *can* I?\\\" she inquired, rather timidly.\\n\\n\\\"Every day, if you like--Sundays and all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must be content with every other day.\\\"\\n\\nVizard said he would arrange it so, and was leaving her; but she begged him to stay a moment.\\n\\n\\\"She would be safer here,\\\" said she, very gravely.\\n\\nVizard was taken aback by the suddenness of this return to a topic he was simple enough to think she had abandoned. However, he said, \\\"She is safe enough. I have taken care of that, you may be sure.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have done well, sir,\\\" said Ina, very gravely.\\n\\nShe said no more to him; but just before dinner Fanny came in, and Miss Gale went for a walk in the garden. Ina pinned Fanny directly. \\\"Where is Miss Vizard?\\\" said she, quietly.\\n\\nFanny colored up; but seeing in a moment that fibs would be dangerous, said, mighty carelessly, \\\"She is at Aunt Maitland's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where does *she* live, dear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In a poky little place called 'Somerville Villa.'\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Far from this?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not very. It is forty miles by the railway, but not thirty by the road; and Zoe went in the barouche all the way.\\\"\\n\\nMademoiselle Klosking thought a little, and then taking Fanny Dover's hand, said to her, very sweetly, \\\"I beg you to honor me with your confidence, and tell me something. Believe me, it is for no selfish motive I ask you; but I think Miss Vizard is in danger. She is too far from her brother, and too far from me. Mr. Vizard says she is safe. Now, can you tell me what he means? How can she be safe? Is her heart turned to stone, like mine?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed,\\\" said Fanny. \\\"Yes, I will be frank with you; for I believe you are wiser than any one of us. Zoe is not safe, left to herself. Her heart is anything but stone; and Heaven knows what wild, mad thing she might be led into. But I know perfectly well what Vizard means: no, I don't like to tell it you all; it will give you pain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is little hope of that. I am past pain.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, then--Miss Gale will scold me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, she shall not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I know you have got the upper hand even of her; so if you promise I shall not be scolded, I'll tell you. You see, I had my misgivings about this very thing; and as soon as Vizard came home--it was he who took her to Aunt Maitland--I asked him what precautions he had taken to hinder that man from getting hold of her again. Well, then--oh, I ought to have begun by telling you Mr. Severne forged bills to get money out of Harrington.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Good Heavens!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Harrington will never punish him, if he keeps his distance; but he has advertised in all the papers, warning him that if he sets foot in Barfordshire he will be arrested and sent to prison.\\\"\\n\\nIna Klosking shook her head. \\\"When a man is in love with such a woman as that, dangers could hardly deter him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That depends upon the man, I think. But Harrington has done better than that. He has provided her with a watch-dog--the best of all watch-dogs--another lover. Lord Uxmoor lives near Aunt Maitland, and he adores Zoe; so Harrington has commissioned him to watch her, and cure her, and all. I wish he'd cure *me*--an earl's coronet and twenty thousand a year!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You relieve my mind,\\\" said Ina. Then after a pause--\\\"But let me ask you one question more. Why did you not tell me Miss Vizard was gone?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know,\\\" said Fanny, coloring up. *\\\"She* told me not.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, the Vixen in command. She orders everybody.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And why did she forbid you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you do. Kiss me, dear. There, I will distress you with no more questions. Why should I? Our instincts seldom deceive us. Well, so be it: I have something more to get well for, and I will.\\\"\\n\\nFanny looked up at her inquiringly.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said she; \\\"the daughter of this hospitable house will never return to it while I am in it. Poor girl; she thinks *she* is the injured woman. So be it. I will get well--and leave it.\\\"\\n\\nFanny communicated this to Miss Gale, and all she said was, \\\"She shall go no further than Hillstoke then; for I love her better than any man can love her.\\\"\\n\\nFanny did not tell Vizard; and he was downright happy, seeing the woman he loved recover, by slow degrees, her health, her strength, her color, her voice. Parting was not threatened. He did not realize that they should ever part at all. He had vague hopes that, while she was under his roof, opportunity might stand his friend, and she might requite his affection. All this would not bear looking into very closely: for that very reason he took particular care not to look into it very closely; but hoped all things, and was happy. In this condition he received a little shock.\\n\\nA one-horse fly was driven up to the door, and a card brought in--\\n\\n\\\"MR. JOSEPH ASHMEAD.\\\"\\n\\nVizard was always at home at Vizard Court, except to convicted Bores. Mr. Ashmead was shown into his study.\\n\\nVizard knew him at a glance. The velveteen coat had yielded to tweed; but another loud tie had succeeded to the one \\\"that fired the air at Homburg.\\\" There, too, was the wash-leather face, and other traits Vizard professed to know an actress's lover by. Yes, it was the very man at sight of whom he had fought down his admiration of La Klosking, and declined an introduction to her. Vizard knew the lady better now. But still he was a little jealous even of her acquaintances, and thought this one unworthy of her; so he received him with stiff but guarded politeness, leaving him to open his business.\\n\\nAshmead, overawed by the avenue, the dozen gables, four-score chimneys, etc., addressed him rather obsequiously, but with a certain honest trouble, that soon softened the bad impression caused by his appearance.\\n\\n\\\"Sir,\\\" said he, \\\"pray excuse this intrusion of a stranger, but I am in great anxiety. It is not for myself, but for a lady, a very distinguished lady, whose interests I am charged with. It is Mademoiselle Klosking, the famous singer.\\\"\\n\\nVizard maintained a grim silence.\\n\\n\\\"You may have heard of her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I almost fancy you once heard her sing--at Homburg.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/21](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/21)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637671215,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Not that I know of,\\\" said Vizard; but he could not help coloring a little.\"},\"digest\":\"4fB8wnJqzkecm9dLtK1DBmoMznuGxmoppmQOsmXG1ZQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x98485E752AD42d721892AE055281b72F1cA81833\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xSQloMxNH9JBHgzV9b_1MpOtSmeP96uQ6HN6rUmAeFI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wcsn8EZyERkkdhdK3Z6_CMRTQmibkZk1FWp8T9AjsH4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"x-hY61F2r526TOAdbedLoDcL-35lIyOw1RP_eT5Y56TdBOGhFLHh_Kn6n5_jhiRnvE96q5IuY6BTv-ZxalnREg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf01766d2843bc2d8f9b5aff8fafc917521bac1b4d4c4a9a5dda93fd4f1b04dfb6cfb0e34d81054d61c3153c6cf538198226d2d871fafca2629493bc80f4b8c0a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xSQloMxNH9JBHgzV9b_1MpOtSmeP96uQ6HN6rUmAeFI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Wcsn8EZyERkkdhdK3Z6_CMRTQmibkZk1FWp8T9AjsH4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4fB8wnJqzkecm9dLtK1DBmoMznuGxmoppmQOsmXG1ZQ\"}"
