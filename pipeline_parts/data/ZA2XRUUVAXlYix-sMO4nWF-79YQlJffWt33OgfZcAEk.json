"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Rose raised her head quickly from her brother's breast. His firmness had deserted him--he was trembling. She heard him whispering to himself, \\\"Rose, too! Oh, my God! I was not prepared for that.\\\" She heard these words, and dashed the tears from her eyes, and kissed him, saying:\\n\\n\\\"I am glad of it, Louis. We risked all together--we shall now suffer together. I am glad of it!\\\"\\n\\nDanville looked incredulously at Lomaque, after the first shock of astonishment was over.\\n\\n\\\"Impossible!\\\" he exclaimed. \\\"I never denounced my wife. There is some mistake; you have exceeded your orders.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Silence!\\\" retorted Lomaque, imperiously. \\\"Silence, citizen, and respect to a decree of the Republic!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You blackguard! show me the arrest-order!\\\" said Danville. \\\"Who has dared to denounce my wife?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have!\\\" said Lomaque, turning on him with a grin of contempt. \\\"You--and 'blackguard' back in your teeth! You, in denouncing her brother! Aha! we work hard in our office; we don't waste time in calling names--we make discoveries. If Trudaine is guilty, your wife is implicated in his guilt. We know it; and we arrest her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I resist the arrest,\\\" cried Danville. \\\"I am the authority here. Who opposes me?\\\"\\n\\nThe impassible chief agent made no answer. Some new noise in the street struck his quick ear. He ran to the window and looked out eagerly.\\n\\n\\\"Who opposes me?\\\" reiterated Danville.\\n\\n\\\"Hark!\\\" exclaimed Lomaque, raising his hand. \\\"Silence, and listen!\\\"\\n\\nThe heavy, dull tramp of men marching together became audible as he spoke. Voices humming low and in unison the Marseillaise hymn, joined solemnly with the heavy, regular footfalls. Soon the flare of torch-light began to glimmer redder and redder under the dim, starlight sky.\\n\\n\\\"Do you hear that? Do you see the advancing torch-light?\\\" cried Lomaque, pointing exultingly into the street. \\\"Respect to the national hymn, and to the man who holds in the hollow of his hand the destinies of all France! Hat off, Citizen Danville! Robespierre is in the street. His bodyguard, the Hard-hitters, are lighting him on his way to the Jacobin Club! Who shall oppose you, did you say? Your master and mine; the man whose signature is at the bottom of this order--the man who with a scratch of his pen can send both our heads rolling together into the sack of the guillotine! Shall I call to him as he passes the house? Shall I tell him that Superintendent Danville resists me in making an arrest? Shall I? Shall I?\\\" And in the immensity of his contempt, Lomaque seemed absolutely to rise in stature, as he thrust the arrest order under Danville's eyes and pointed to the signature with the head of his stick.\\n\\nRose looked round in terror, as Lomaque spoke his last words--looked round, and saw her husband recoil before the signature on the arrest order, as if the guillotine itself had suddenly arisen before him. Her brother felt her shrinking back in his arms, and trembled for the preservation of her self-control if the terror and suspense of the arrest lasted any longer.\\n\\n\\\"Courage, Rose, courage!\\\" he said. \\\"You have behaved nobly; you must not fail now. No, no! Not a word more. Not a word till I am able to think clearly again, and to decide what is best. Courage, love; our lives depend on it. Citizen,\\\" he continued, addressing himself to Lomaque, \\\"proceed with your duty--we are ready.\\\"\\n\\nThe heavy marching footsteps outside were striking louder and louder on the ground; the chanting voices were every moment swelling in volume; the dark street was flaming again with the brightening torch-light, as Lomaque, under pretext of giving Trudaine his hat, came close to him, and, turning his back toward Danville, whispered: \\\"I have not forgotten the eve of the wedding and the bench on the river bank.\\\"\\n\\nBefore Trudaine could answer, he had taken Rose's cloak and hood from one of his assistants, and was helping her on with it. Danville, still pale and trembling, advanced a step when he saw these preparations for departure, and addressed a word or two to his wife; but he spoke in low tones, and the fast-advancing march of feet and sullen low roar of singing outside drowned his voice. An oath burst from his lips, and he struck his fist, in impotent fury, on a table near him.\\n\\n\\\"The seals are set on everything in this room and in the bedroom,\\\" said Magloire, approaching Lomaque, who nodded and signed to him to bring up the other police agents at the door.\\n\\n\\\"Ready,\\\" cried Magloire, coming forward immediately with his men, and raising his voice to make himself heard. \\\"Where to?\\\"\\n\\nRobespierre and his Hard-hitters were passing the house. The smoke of the torch-light was rolling in at the window; the tramping footsteps struck heavier and heavier on the ground; the low sullen roar of the Marseillaise was swelling to its loudest, as Lomaque referred for a moment to his arrest-order, and then answered:\\n\\n\\\"To the prison of St. Lazare!\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER III.\\n\\nTHE head jailer of St. Lazare stood in the outer hall of the prison, two days after the arrest at Trudaine's lodgings, smoking his morning pipe. Looking toward the courtyard gate, he saw the wicket opened, and a privileged man let in, whom he soon recognized as the chief agent of the second section of Secret Police. \\\"Why, friend Lomaque,\\\" cried the jailer, a dvancing toward the courtyard, \\\"what brings you here this morning, business or pleasure?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Pleasure, this time, citizen. I have an idle hour or two to spare for a walk. I find myself passing the prison, and I can't resist calling in to see how my friend the head jailer is getting on.\\\" Lomaque spoke in a surprisingly brisk and airy manner. His eyes were suffering under a violent fit of weakness and winking; but he smiled, notwithstanding, with an air of the most inveterate cheerfulness. Those old enemies of his, who always distrusted him most when his eyes were most affected, would have certainly disbelieved every word of the friendly speech he had just made, and would have assumed it as a matter of fact that his visit to the head jailer had some specially underhand business at the bottom of it.\\n\\n\\\"How am I getting on?\\\" said the jailer, shaking his head. \\\"Overworked, friend--overworked. No idle hours in our department. Even the guilotine is getting too slow for us!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sent off your batch of prisoners for trial this morning?\\\" asked Lomaque, with an appearance of perfect unconcern.\\n\\n\\\"No; they're just going,\\\" answered the other. \\\"Come and have a look at them.\\\" He spoke as if the prisoners were a collection of pictures on view, or a set of dresses just made up. Lomaque nodded his head, still with his air of happy, holiday carelessness. The jailer led the way to an inner hall; and, pointing lazily with his pipe-stem, said: \\\"Our morning batch, citizen, just ready for the baking.\\\"\\n\\nIn one comer of the hall were huddled together more than thirty men and women of all ranks and ages; some staring round them with looks of blank despair; some laughing and gossiping recklessly. Near them lounged a guard of \\\"Patriots,\\\" smoking, spitting, and swearing. Between the patriots and the prisoners sat, on a rickety stool, the second jailer--a humpbacked man, with an immense red mustache--finishing his breakfast of broad beans, which he scooped out of a basin with his knife, and washed down with copious draughts of wine from a bottle. Carelessly as Lomaque looked at the shocking scene before him, his quick eyes contrived to take note of every prisoner's face, and to descry in a few minutes Trudaine and his sister standing together at the back of the group.\\n\\n\\\"Now then, Apollo!\\\" cried the head jailer, addressing his subordinate by a facetious prison nickname, \\\"don't be all day starting that trumpery batch of yours. And harkye, friend, I have leave of absence, on business, at my Section this afternoon. So it will be your duty to read the list for the guillotine, and chalk the prisoners' doors before the cart comes to-morrow morning. 'Ware the bottle, Apollo, to-day; 'ware the bottle, for fear of accidents with the death-list tomorrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thirsty July weather, this--eh, citizen?\\\" said Lomaque, leaving the head jailer, and patting the hunchback in the friendliest manner on the shoulder. \\\"Why, how you have got your batch huddled up together this morning! Shall I help you to shove them into marching order? My time is quite at your disposal. This is a holiday morning with me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ha, ha, ha! what a jolly dog he is on his holiday morning!\\\" exclaimed the head jailer, as Lomaque--apparently taking leave of his natural character altogether in the exhilaration of an hour's unexpected leisure--began pushing and pulling the prisoners into rank, with humorous mock apologies, at which not the officials only, but many of the victims themselves--reckless victims of a reckless tyranny--laughed heartily. Persevering to the last in his practical jest, Lomaque contrived to get close to Trudaine for a minute, and to give him one significant look before he seized him by the shoulders, like the rest. Now, then, rear-guard,\\\" cried Lomaque, pushing Trudaine on, \\\"close the line of march, and mind you keep step with your young woman there. Pluck up your spirits, citoyenne! one gets used to everything in this world, even to the guillotine!\\\"\\n\\nWhile he was speaking and pushing at the same time, Trudaine felt a piece of paper slip quickly between his neck and his cravat. \\\"Courage!\\\" he whispered, pressing his sister's hand, as he saw her shuddering under the assumed brutality of Lomaque's joke.\\n\\nSurrounded by the guard of \\\"Patriots,\\\" the procession of prisoners moved slowly into the outer courtyard, on its way to the revolutionary tribunal, the humpbacked jailer bringing up the rear. Lomaque was about to follow at some little distance, but the head jailer hospitably expostulated. \\\"What a hurry you're in!\\\" said he. \\\"Now that incorrigible drinker, my second in command, has gone off with his batch, I don't mind asking you to step in and have a drop of wine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thank you,\\\" answered Lomaque; \\\"but I have rather a fancy for hearing the trial this morning. Suppose I come back afterward? What time do you go to your Section? At two o'clock, eh? Good! I shall try if I can't get here soon after one.\\\" With these words he nodded and went out. The brilliant sunlight in the courtyard made him wink faster than ever. Had any of his old enemies been with him, they would have whispered within themselves, \\\"If you mean to come back at all, Citizen Lomaque, it will not be soon after one!\\\"\\n\\nOn his way through the streets, the chief agent met one or two police office friends, who delayed his progress; so that when he arrived at the revolutionary tribunal the trials of the day were just about to begin.\\n\\nThe principal article of furniture in the Hall of Justice was a long, clumsy, deal table, covered with green baize. At the head of this table sat the president and his court, with their hats on, backed by a heterogeneous collection of patriots officially connected in various ways with the proceedings that were to take place. Below the front of the table, a railed-off space, with a gallery beyond, was appropriated to the general public--mostly represented, as to the gallery, on this occasion, by women, all sitting together on forms, knitting, shirt-mending, and baby-linen-making, as coolly as if they were at home. Parallel with the side of the table furthest from the great door of entrance was a low platform railed off, on which the prisoners, surrounded by their guard, were now assembled to await their trial. The sun shone in brightly from a high window, and a hum of ceaseless talking pervaded the hall cheerfully as Lomaque entered it. He was a privileged man here, as at the prison; and he made his way in by a private door, so as to pass to the prisoners' platform, and to walk round it, before he got to a place behind the president's chair. Trudaine, standing with his sister on the outermost limits of the group, nodded significantly as Lomaque looked up at him for an instant. He had contrived, on his way to the tribunal, to get an opportunity of reading the paper which the chief agent had slipped into his cravat. It contained these lines:\\n\\n\\\"I have just discovered who the citizen and citoyenne Dubois are. There is no chance for you but to confess everything. By that means you may inculpate a certain citizen holding authority, and may make it his interest, if he loves his own life, to save yours and your sister's.\\\"\\n\\nArrived at the back of the president's chair, Lomaque recognized his two trusty subordinates, Magloire and Picard, waiting among the assembled patriot officials, to give their evidence. Beyond them, leaning against the wall, addressed by no one, and speaking to no one, stood the superintendent, Danville. Doubt and suspense were written in every line of his face; the fretfulness of an uneasy mind expressed itself in his slightest gesture--even in his manner of passing a handkerchief from time to time over his face, on which the perspiration was gathering thick and fast already.\\n\\n\\\"Silence!\\\" cried the usher of the court for the time being--a hoarse-voiced man in top-boots with a huge saber buckled to his side, and a bludgeon in his hand. \\\"Silence for the Citizen President!\\\" he reiterated, striking his bludgeon on the table.\\n\\nThe president rose and proclaimed that the sitting for the day had begun; then sat down again.\\n\\nThe momentary silence which followed was interrupted by a sudden confusion  among the prisoners on  the platform. Two of the guards sprang in among them. There was the thump of a heavy fall--a scream of terror from some of the female prisoners--then another dead silence, broken by one of the guards, who walked across the hall with a bloody knife in his hand, and laid it on the table. \\\"Citizen President,\\\" he said, \\\"I have to report that one of the prisoners has just stabbed himself.\\\" There was a murmuring exclamation, \\\"Is that all?\\\" among the women spectators, as they resumed their work. Suicide at the bar of justice was no uncommon occurrence, under the Reign of Terror.\\n\\n\\\"Name?\\\" asked the president, quietly taking up his pen and opening a book.\\n\\n\\\"Martigne,\\\" answered the humpbacked jailer, coming forward to the table.\\n\\n\\\"Description?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ex-royalist coach-maker to the tyrant Capet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Accusation?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Conspiracy in prison.\\\"\\n\\nThe president nodded, and entered in the book: \\\"Martigne, coachmaker. Accused of conspiring in prison. Anticipated course of law by suicide. Action accepted as sufficient confession of guilt. Goods confiscated. 1st Thermidor, year two of the Republic.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Silence!\\\" cried the man with the bludgeon, as the president dropped a little sand on the entry, and signing to the jailer that he might remove the dead body, closed the book.\\n\\n\\\"Any special cases this morning?\\\" resumed the president, looking round at the group behind him.\\n\\n\\\"There is one,\\\" said Lomaque, making his way to the back of the official chair. \\\"Will it be convenient to you, citizen, to take the case of Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville first? Two of my men are detained here as witnesses, and their time is valuable to the Republic.\\\"\\n\\nThe president marked a list of names before him, and handed it to the crier or usher, placing the figures one and two against Louis Trudaine and Rose Danville.\\n\\nWhile Lomaque was backing again to his former place behind the chair, Danville approached and whispered to him, \\\"There is a rumor that secret information has reached you about the citizen and citoyenne Dubois. Is it true? Do you know who they are?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" answered Lomaque; \\\"but I have superior orders to keep the information to myself just at present.\\\"\\n\\nThe eagerness with which Danville put his question, and the disappointment he showed on getting no satisfactory answer to it, were of a nature to satisfy the observant chief agent that his superintendent was really as ignorant as he appeared to be on the subject of the man and woman Dubois. That one mystery, at any rate was still, for Danville, a mystery unrevealed.\\n\\n\\\"Louis Trudaine! Rose Danville!\\\" shouted the crier, with another rap of his bludgeon.\\n\\nThe two came forward, at the appeal, to the front railing of the platform. The first sight of her judges, the first shock on confronting the pitiless curiosity of the audience, seemed to overwhelm Rose. She turned from deadly pale to crimson, then to pale again, and hid her face on her brother's shoulder. How fast she heard his heart throbbing! How the tears filled her eyes as she felt that his fear was all for her!\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said the president, writing down their names. \\\"Denounced by whom?\\\"\\n\\nMagloire and Picard stepped forward to the table. The first answered--\\\"By Citizen Superintendent Danville.\\\"\\n\\nThe reply made a great stir and sensation among both prisoners and audience.\\n\\n\\\"Accused of what?\\\" pursued the president.\\n\\n\\\"The male prisoner, of conspiracy against the Republic; the female prisoner, of criminal knowledge of the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Produce your proofs in answer to this order.\\\"\\n\\nPicard and Magloire opened their minutes of evidence, and read to the president the same particulars which they had formerly read to Lomaque in the secret police office.\\n\\n\\\"Good,\\\" said the president, when they had done, \\\"we need trouble ourselves with nothing more than the identifying of the citizen and citoyenne Dubois, which, of course, you are prepared for. Have you heard the evidence?\\\" he continued, turning to the prisoners; while Picard and Magloire consulted together in whispers, looking perplexedly toward the chief agent, who stood silent behind them. \\\"Have you heard the evidence, prisoners? Do you wish to say anything? If you do, remember that the time of this tribunal is precious, and that you will not be suffered to waste it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I demand permission to speak for myself and for my sister,\\\" answered Trudaine. \\\"My object is to save the time of the tribunal by making a confession.\\\"\\n\\nThe faint whispering, audible among the women spectators a moment before, ceased instantaneously as he pronounced the word confession. In the breathless silence, his low, quiet tones penetrated to the remotest corners of the hall; while, suppressing externally all evidences of the death-agony of hope within him, he continued his address in these words:\\n\\n\\\"I confess my secret visits to the house in the Rue de Clery. I confess that the persons whom I went to see are the persons pointed at in the evidence. And, lastly, I confess that my object in communicating with them as I did was to supply them with the means of leaving France. If I had acted from political motives to the political prejudice of the existing government, I admit that I should be guilty of that conspiracy against the Republic with which I am charged. But no political purpose animated, no political necessity urged me, in performing the action which has brought me to the bar of this tribunal. The persons whom I aided in leaving France were without political influence or political connections. I acted solely from private motives of humanity toward them and toward others--motives which a good republican may feel, and yet not turn traitor to the welfare of his country.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you ready to inform the court, next, who the man and woman Dubois really are?\\\" inquired the president, impatiently.\\n\\n\\\"I am ready,\\\" answered Trudaine. \\\"But first I desire to say one word in reference to my sister, charged here at the bar with me.\\\" His voice grew less steady, and, for the first time, his color began to change, as Rose lifted her face from his shoulder and looked up at him eagerly. I implore the tribunal to consider my sister as innocent of all active participation in what is charged against me as a crime--\\\" He went on. \\\"Having spoken with candor about myself, I have some claim to be believed when I speak of her; when I assert that she neither did help me nor could help me. If there be blame, it is mine only; if punishment, it is I alone who should suffer.\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped suddenly, and grew confused. It was easy to guard himself from the peril of looking at Rose, but he could not escape the hard trial to his self-possession of hearing her, if she spoke. Just as he pronounced the last sentence, she raised her face again from his shoulder, and eagerly whispered to him:\\n\\n\\\"No, no, Louis! Not that sacrifice, after all the others--not that, though you should force me into speaking to them myself!\\\"\\n\\nShe abruptly quitted her hold of him, and fronted the whole court in an instant. The railing in front of her shook with the quivering of her arms and hands as she held by it to support herself! Her hair lay tangled on her shoulders; her face had assumed a strange fixedness; her gentle blue eyes, so soft and tender at all other times, were lit up wildly. A low hum of murmured curiosity and admiration broke from the women of the audience. Some rose eagerly from the benches; others cried:\\n\\n\\\"Listen, listen! she is going to speak!\\\"\\n\\nShe did speak. Silvery and pure the sweet voice, sweeter than ever in sadness, stole its way through the gross sounds--through the coarse humming and the hissing whispers.\\n\\n\\\"My lord the president,\\\" began the poor girl firmly. Her next words were drowned in a volley of hisses from the women.\\n\\n\\\"Ah! aristocrat, aristocrat! None of your accursed titles here!\\\" was their shrill cry at her. She fronted that cry, she fronted the fierce gestures which accompanied it, with the steady light still in her eyes, with the strange rigidity still fastened on her face. She would have spoken again through the uproar and execration, but her brother's voice overpowered her.\\n\\n\\\"Citizen president,\\\" he cried, \\\"I have not concluded. I demand leave to complete my confession. I  implore the tribunal to  attach no importance to what my sister says. The trouble and terror of this day have shaken her intellects. She is not responsible for her words--I assert it solemnly, in the face of the whole court!\\\"\\n\\nThe blood flew up into his white face as he made the asseveration. Even at that supreme moment the great heart of the man reproached him for yielding himself to a deception, though the motive of it was to save his sister's life.\\n\\n\\\"Let her speak! let her speak!\\\" exclaimed the women, as Rose, without moving, without looking at her brother, without seeming even to have heard what he said, made a second attempt to address her judges, in spite of Trudaine's interposition.\\n\\n\\\"Silence!\\\" shouted the man with the bludgeon. \\\"Silence, you women! the citizen president is going to speak.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The prisoner Trudaine has the ear of the court,\\\" said the president, \\\"and may continue his confession. If the female prisoner wishes to speak, she may be heard afterward. I enjoin both the accused persons to make short work of it with their addresses to me, or they will make their case worse instead of better. I command silence among the audience, and if I am not obeyed, I will clear the hall. Now, prisoner Trudaine, I invite you to proceed. No more about your sister; let her speak for herself. Your business and ours is with the man and woman Dubois. Are you, or are you not, ready to tell the court who they are?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I repeat that I am ready,\\\" answered Trudaine. \\\"The citizen Dubois is a servant. The woman Dubois is the mother of the man who denounces me--Superintendent Danville.\\\"\\n\\nA low, murmuring, rushing sound of hundreds of exclaiming voices, all speaking, half-suppressedly, at the same moment, followed the delivery of the answer. No officer of the court attempted to control the outburst of astonishment. The infection of it spread to the persons on the platform, to the crier himself, to the judges of the tribunal, lounging, but the moment before, so carelessly silent in their chairs. When the noise was at length quelled, it was subdued in the most instantaneous manner by one man, who shouted from the throng behind the president's chair:\\n\\n\\\"Clear the way there! Superintendent Danville is taken ill!\\\"\\n\\nA vehement whispering and contending of many voices interrupting each other, followed; then a swaying among the assembly of official people; then a great stillness; then the sudden appearance of Danville, alone, at the table.\\n\\nThe look of him, as he turned his ghastly face toward the audience, silenced and steadied them in an instant, just as they were on the point of falling into fresh confusion. Every one stretched forward eagerly to hear what he would say. His lips moved; but the few words that fell from them were inaudible, except to the persons who happened to be close by him. Having spoken, he left the table supported by a police agent, who was seen to lead him toward the private door of the court, and, consequently, also toward the prisoners' platform. He stopped, however, halfway, quickly turned his face from the prisoners, and pointing toward the public door at the opposite side of the hall, caused himself to be led out into the air by that direction. When he had gone the president, addressing himself partly to Trudaine and partly to the audience, said:\\n\\n\\\"The Citizen Superintendent Danville has been overcome by the heat in the court. He has retired by my desire, under the care of a police agent, to recover in the open air; pledging himself to me to come back and throw a new light on the extraordinary and suspicious statement which the prisoner has just made. Until the return of Citizen Danville, I order the accused, Trudaine, to suspend any further acknowledgment of complicity which he may have to address to me. This matter must be cleared up before other matters are entered on. Meanwhile, in order that the time of the tribunal may not be wasted, I authorize the female prisoner to take this opportunity of making any statement concerning herself which she may wish to address to the judges.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Silence him!\\\" \\\"Remove him out of court!\\\" \\\"Gag him!\\\" \\\"Guillotine him!\\\" These cries rose from the audience the moment the president had done speaking. They were all directed at Trudaine, who had made a last desperate effort to persuade his sister to keep silence, and had been detected in the attempt by the spectators.\\n\\n\\\"If the prisoner speaks another word to his sister, remove him,\\\" said the president, addressing the guard round the platform.\\n\\n\\\"Good! we shall hear her at last. Silence! silence!\\\" exclaimed the women, settling themselves comfortably on their benches, and preparing to resume their work.\\n\\n\\\"Rose Danville, the court is waiting to hear you,\\\" said the president, crossing his legs and leaning back luxuriously in his large armchair.\\n\\nAmid all the noise and confusion of the last few minutes, Rose had stood ever in the same attitude, with that strangely fixed expression never altering on her face but once. When her husband made his way to the side of the table and stood there prominently alone, her lips trembled a little, and a faint shade of color passed swiftly over her cheeks. Even that slight change had vanished now--she was paler, stiller, more widely altered from her former self than ever, as she faced the president and said these words:\",\"timestamp\":1639129178,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Rose Danville,\\\" continued Lomaque, impassibly, \\\"you are included in the arrest of Louis Trudaine.\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"xH8H7B_tgeuq0GQkHnnBUK0Qt2qc40oVZsizXcDF_lA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xebb47BcE22955a8570D5570840798eda13Ec89EB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"udiX9U1qfwuTNXMOD6hLQxTL_AO5Pl5zVLplYPH3joU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"E_F0V_iS-7v7-8iZg2-SPnGyc7sgzJhZKSj2rGswbVA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oXE1bJm2v5xR6n7kssNdSoCvLweyHn0NxqEeKpzR9PLQcgFt4UaiQVGQDCfdWb_5UJI2Np_0qT2h3efFwz6Y8w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x41cd8c6e853490e7727e38444f7da0fdb0638654189141711e82a7c7213a4d4f441a36baed067f42f1b03eb722a970bc26de59e297183b6cb5ff06fa32fcb4461b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"udiX9U1qfwuTNXMOD6hLQxTL_AO5Pl5zVLplYPH3joU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"E_F0V_iS-7v7-8iZg2-SPnGyc7sgzJhZKSj2rGswbVA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xH8H7B_tgeuq0GQkHnnBUK0Qt2qc40oVZsizXcDF_lA\"}"
