We govern, share, and maintain them as a society. While imperfect in how they are built or administered, these objects draw us together in dialogue, debate, and common concern (Honig, 2017). More than mere things, natural landscapes and built environments are cultural touchpoints. They involve us in care for the public good.\\n\\n![Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard, now recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Clean air is an example of a naturally occurring public good, while the electric grid is a public good created by people. What are the public goods of today's industrial-knowledge society? Open source code, which supports millions of companies and independent developers, is often thought of this way. The cypherpunks considered privacy itself as a kind of public good. It seems only natural that online media archives and open digital infrastructure should qualify as well.\\n\\nMore recently, Vitalik Buterin and others in the cryptocurrency community have taken up the rhetoric of blockchain mechanisms as public goods. To be sure, crypto protocols are among the most compelling novel institutional forms. Their unique capabilities derive from their \\\"public\\\" qualities: unrestricted membership and participation, open APIs, transparent allocation of resources and power. But at the same time many of their characteristics contradict claims of public accessibility. Can crypto protocols be considered public goods if ownership is concentrated in the hands of a few whales? Colloquially, these market primitives are sometimes described as \\\"public infrastructure,\\\" but if blockchains serve a \\\"public\\\" today, it is primarily one of decentralized finance. Fundamentally, these tokenholders share only one common object of concern: price.\\n\\nSo while crypto protocols may qualify as public goods in the economic sense, where in these conversations is discussion of what's good for the public? Some of the crypto community's stated ambitions are to solve mass coordination problems, build post-national forms of sovereignty, and level the global playing field. But to create a majestic and egalitarian society requires a more expansive vision of public goods than what can be imagined with economics alone.\\n\\n![Ancient Ruins Used as Public Baths, Hubert Robert (1798)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/81fd1a35-4953-49c1-b54c-3ec794ec8db4.jpeg?height=853&width=1247)\\n\\nThe public bath houses of the Romans, accessible to both rich and poor, were the cornerstone of both the city's public health and its rich cultural life. At its peak, the Library of Alexandria held hundreds of thousands of texts, among the largest stores of public knowledge in the ancient world. Although exclusionary in many respects, these wonders are precursors to the public goods we know today. They point towards an ideal of openness and universality. As builders of a new digital society, we must be equipped with an even more inclusive and visionary concept of what \\\"public\\\" and \\\"good\\\" can mean. As protocol treasuries transition to community stewardship of public works, it's time to imagine how crypto protocols might uniquely conceive of public goods.\\n\\n## The Scope of the Public\\n\\nOur new understanding of public goods starts by exploring notions of the public. What makes something public? What constitutes *the* public?\\n\\nThe vernacular term \\\"public\\\" is understood to be something of the people, freely available for use—such as parks, roads, and common lands. Crypto protocols' strongest claim to publicness is based on this principle of open and permissionless access. Blockchains overcome a key limitation of Web 1 and Web 2 publics: their failure to satisfy the criteria of inalienable access. The internet's so-called \\\"public spaces\\\" are nothing like our cities' public parks. They are merely someone else's private server, where access can be revoked at will. By contrast, crypto protocols deliberately enforce unimpeded access.\\n\\nBut a public is more than a means of access to public space. Another key definition is a public as body of people, defined in relation to some political association. In 17th century England, a newly uncensored press circulated articles of public opinion, including notes from salon gatherings and critical journals. Often reproachful of the state, these published media brought \\\"private people together as a public\\\" for the first time (Habermas, 1989). Less than a century later, French revolutionaries orchestrated a new peoples' self-consciousness by organizing festivals, erecting monuments, and designating new communal spaces (Ozouf, 1975). In both instances, political bodies were raised to the status of institutions by establishing new venues for storytelling—venues in which people could begin to identify themselves as part of a collective whole, that is, a public.\\n\\n![Festival of the Supreme Being, organized in 1794 to inaugurate the new state religion after the French Revolution.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0c066ec4-6837-4f4f-b8de-4d6ac8cc7f01.jpeg?height=775&width=1120)\\n\\nThis notion of the public as a self-conscious entity has also taken hold on the internet, where adoption is driven by *publication* and circulation of media. To publish a web document or software application is more than making something public: it's an act of making a public (Warner, 2002). Cryptocurrency advocates often draw on this idea when they refer to token holders as a \\\"community,\\\" or compare protocols to nations with citizens. Sovereign moneys created by blockchains certainly offer a ready comparison to sovereign states, and their immutability means APIs can't be modified or revoked without broad consensus.\\n\\nThese ideas feed the notion of crypto protocols as public goods, yet together they present a complicated picture. Despite their \\\"open\\\" qualities, crypto protocols do not yet offer a satisfying answer to the scope of the public they address.\\n\\nIn today's crypto ecosystems, token-based membership determines key considerations such as resource allocation, on-chain incentives, and off-chain decision-making. While a blockchain's censorship resistance may seem like the solution to a world of gatekeepers, in reality, pay-to-play limits access in other ways. Protocols may be owned by thousands, even millions of stakeholders, but they are not in everyone's benefit—only those who have the time, expertise, or resources to participate.\\n\\nWhat then are the implications of defining a public as a set of users? Web 2 platforms offer us a crucial lesson. The social media platforms which dominate the web today claim to be tools made for \\\"communities\\\" of users who have opted to participate—but these platforms have also produced wide-reaching negative externalities: effects on third parties who did not agree to incur their costs. The externalities of platforms include incursions on personal privacy, the spread of misinformation, the devaluation of creative labor, even destabilization of the democratic process. These effects are often cited as a primary motivation for those now working in Web 3 to now establish sovereign spaces built on a foundation of public accountability.\\n\\nWhile social platforms offer one example of a misconstrued public, nascent Web 3 \\\"public spaces\\\" suffer similar problems of definition, scope, and representation. The equivalence of stake and voice in crypto is reminiscent of early American democracy, in which political representation was conditioned on property ownership. Under this regime, only 6% of the total US population was eligible to vote—a laughably exclusionary idea of the body politic by today's standards (Ratcliffe, 2013). Recall that the universal suffrage, human rights, and public services we enjoy today are the products of struggle by those who were excluded from the designated public to have their voice represented. In fact, the theory of \\\"counterpublics\\\" specifically addresses groups who are not admitted within the larger public sphere, groups whose members may not be deemed as persons (Warner, 2002).\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1625538747,\"title\":\"Positive Sum Worlds: Remaking Public Goods\",\"publication\":\"jktest\"},\"digest\":\"GkgcddGOSFa6NhCe0Feqk36vWOI2BD_4KRnIOc91E5Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x841fF85B6873d7bfB712C8f7A347C774355b6EC3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JMJMNe46c7MX6HPmzMgPEcSqvtL4e1Pzgn7haFrotk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SoFwdXGixpIoUQoNoP-vOkAPxehb_a9uKHbXN21Q7SE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qZpNg_S0byB2nbzlmILDFK2hdWI-Y3tlS8r8ie_pNSTx--u6BlD1WiiThrupMTYtU1_NTseXRjkqPH9WzNU1rw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x14c44ee34767047489370a52971282132b843d8f2c0fedcb5fd5ddce9c680250588ff9791a65ec8a471946de09058365d4fc8d3054254607ee0d72c4b335112b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jktest.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JMJMNe46c7MX6HPmzMgPEcSqvtL4e1Pzgn7haFrotk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SoFwdXGixpIoUQoNoP-vOkAPxehb_a9uKHbXN21Q7SE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OfKqtsM6xujpWVqZDTe0Z9ePMJpfYpAQ5Bx46dSYVyU\"}"
