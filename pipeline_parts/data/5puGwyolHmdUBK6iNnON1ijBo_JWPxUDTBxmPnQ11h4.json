"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Envelop Protocol is an NFT packaging and cross-chain protocol with collateral support and price discovery, which mainly provides intrinsic value and liquidity for NFT. Envelop Protocol mainly realizes the value discovery of NFT through Oracle, Index and Protocol, and through the Staking 2.0 and micro-DAO architecture of tokens, holders can share the expenditure and income of related DAOs, thereby reshaping and Change the existing NFT transaction and market structure.\\nEnvelop Protocol main process\\n\\nEnvelop Protocol mainly combines NFT metadata, mortgage assets and set smart contract conditions to synthesize and package NFT assets into wrapped NFT. We can regard wrapped NFT as a smart contract, and perform corresponding actions through the agreement within the contract. The transfer of the asset package and the corresponding unpacking operation will form the value support of NFT.\\nOrdinary NFT is mainly composed of two parts, namely metadata and newly generated Token, which are packaged to form a token, which forms the NFT asset as we know it. The NFT generated through the Envelop protocol consists of three parts, which are composed of metadata, mortgaged Token assets and smart contract conditions, which will bring more expanded gameplay to NFT.\\n\\nNFT value support. The main value of the packaged NFT is the added value of the NFT itself and the value of the mortgaged asset. The added value can be regarded as a part of the premium behavior. The value of the mortgaged asset is the floor price of this NFT. NFT can be used for mortgage assets. In the process of packing and unpacking, once the NFT price is lower than the value of the mortgaged asset, investors can unpack and carry out corresponding arbitrage operations to maintain the price of NFT in the market and prevent the occurrence of unmarketable or unsellable prices problem.\\n\\nEnvelop Protocol provides a price oracle machine for NFT. Through the oracle machine's valuation of mortgage assets, an overall valuation of NFT can be formed, thereby forming NFT pricing rules, expanding the trading activity of NFT in the market, and can be derived from it There are many gameplays, such as NFT pledge to generate stable coins or NFT pledge lending and other innovations with DEFI.\\n\\nThe NFT index can establish a complete index system through corresponding price monitoring of the wrapped NFT, so as to regulate the trading behavior of the existing NFT market and promote the healthy development of the NFT market.\",\"timestamp\":1634581590,\"title\":\"Envelop Protocol changes the existing NFT market structure\"},\"digest\":\"rO2Rurkh2FZV6-E7MQyVsq9SyxKFplIng44TGLzfCto\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA8Ce56681E8d90ccCF361Cf896e1B31BF15d29b2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Rk-M-k-Urzu5XOvBTC5uIOony_7XZ9eRTGeHm7NAweo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"B_YYLDZ20y15xH_koUluO1AEZMRp1rD5jgb0vpcZCxA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AetpTyjhJzMTkqu7cLGYwSfyJEkv_UMXXejyledEMstheWIZq3UvqhoR9UmDO8Azqe3DUcFKYGZA5HCe4Xz6Sw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x94fd2b870a89d4302b66f5f5bb507f08cc8a3b3978ea31b4afed7b184d614dc265d1356921a78aa4b65a6dc67e0824542d6b23e8942931f708b95f200c67413c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Rk-M-k-Urzu5XOvBTC5uIOony_7XZ9eRTGeHm7NAweo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"B_YYLDZ20y15xH_koUluO1AEZMRp1rD5jgb0vpcZCxA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rO2Rurkh2FZV6-E7MQyVsq9SyxKFplIng44TGLzfCto\"}"
