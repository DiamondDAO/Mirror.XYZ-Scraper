"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I'm using Mirror to auction the third piece in my Stem copy series, based on David Rudnick's Stem series. For every Stem that David has published, I've produced a copy in Paint on my computer. This is piece 3/4 in that series, and the only one currently for sale. You can see David's original here:\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/2000)\\n\\n\\n### History\\n\\nWhen David's [Stem I](https://zora.co/void/500) was originally released, @milkshapes minted \\\"Saved,\\\" a screenshot of the piece.\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/milkshapes/status/1361210453746085888?s=20)\\n\\nWith the original and the screenshot both off the table, I was forced to manually create my own version using MS Paint. I created Stem I copy, which you can see below.\\n\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/648)\\n\\nThis was meant to be a one-off joke piece, riffing on \\\"Saved.\\\" I created it on a whim when I saw the tweet, and completed it in about 45 minutes. I'm not a Rudnick stan, and I am not an artist. But by the time I published it, I actually liked the work I had made, and I liked the original work even more.\\n\\nI didn't know of plans for more stems, but a few weeks later, David released Stem II and Stem III. As soon as I saw the new pieces, I felt a strong compulsion to create copies of each, maintaining equilibrium between the paint copies and the originals.\\n\\nI created Stem II and Stem III copies, which you can see below as well.\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1372390863796600832?s=20)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/john_c_palmer/status/1372744224945414146?s=20)\\n\\nThese copies cemented something for me. As of today, I'm committed to making a copy of every stem that gets released. The idea has shifted away from being a joke and more towards feeling like something I must do. I don't really understand my motivation for doing it at this point. It's certainly not \\\"funny\\\" anymore, and I don't think it's very cool either. In many ways it's extremely annoying. But I feel an obsessive compulsion to keep doing it.\\n\\nAs of today, 4 stems have been created, as have 4 paint copies. Each copy takes about 5-6 hours and is completed in one sitting.\\n\\nStem I was sold by me on Zora. Stem II was also sold on Zora, but all proceeds went to charity. Stem IV was gifted to a friend in an art swap.\\n\\nThat makes Stem III the only remaining stem copy available for sale.\\n\\n### Auction and Split\\nUsing Mirror splits, I'm able to split up the earnings from this sale. 25% will go to David himself, and 25% will go to $ESSAY holders via the $ESSAY smart contract.\\n\\nStem III copy is visible in the embedded block below. The auction will be open for 24 hours. Thanks!\\n\\n\\n[Token #2280](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=2280)\\n\\n### Split\\n\\nThe auction is now over.
