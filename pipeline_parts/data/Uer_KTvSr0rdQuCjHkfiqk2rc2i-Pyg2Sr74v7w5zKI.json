"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello, and thanks for choosing Sherman Atlantic. We thank you in advance for your undivided attention during this brief pre-flight safety orientation. Please take a minute to review the safety instructions pamphlet located in the seat pocket to your left, and follow along while we go over one final protocol review. We’ll be on our way shortly. Welcome aboard!\\n\\nFirst things first, we’d like to extend our sincerest congratulations and express our honest bewilderment regarding your completion of our time traveling bootcamp program. Not only did you manage to successfully pass all of our prerequisite courses in general relativity, quantum mechanics, theoretical physics, and science fiction history, but your immune system also managed to survive immunization and inoculation for every disease known to mankind since the dawn of human history. From all of us here at Sherman Atlantic, congrats! And wow!\\n\\nSmoking is strictly prohibited during taxi, take off, teleportation, or landing, unless your reason for time traveling with us today is to prevent your past self from picking up your first cigarette. In that case, you’ll find a complimentary final smoke in the seat pocket to your left.\\n\\nWe would like to remind you that in the case of unexpected turbulence to just sit back, relax, clench your buttocks and hold your breath until it’s over. In case of an emergency water landing, this vehicle is equipped to convert into a naval grade submarine. We regret having overlooked submarine operation instruction during your bootcamp training, so in the rare chance this occurs during your flight, just do your best. In case of extraterrestrial contact during flight, press the red button under your seat to get in contact with NASA immediately. In case of spontaneous human combustion, you’re fucked.\\n\\nWe would now like to ensure that Sherman Atlantic has your full cooperation regarding our strict time traveler code of conduct. We are going to take this opportunity to review our policies with you, and you can accept them on the screen in front of you.\\n\\n*First, do you agree to not visit any MIT time traveler conventions, because those are for nerds?*\\n\\n*Thank you. Do you accept the Marty McFly rule, and agree that under no circumstances will you make any attempts during your visit to try and bang a younger version of your mom?*\\n\\n*Thank you. And finally, do you agree to make zero attempts to witness or disrupt the Kennedy assassination because it absolutely needed to happen for reasons we won’t get into and you should absolutely make no attempts to find out?*\\n\\n*Thank you.*\\n\\nShould a change in cabin air pressure occur during flight, an oxygen mask will appear in front of you. To start the flow of oxygen, pull the mask towards you. Place it firmly over your nose and mouth, secure the elastic band behind your head, and breathe normally. You might be expecting us to now say something along the lines of how you should secure your own mask before assisting any traveling companions, but we at Sherman Atlantic know that you are flying alone today, and that your desire to visit the past stems from a deep discontentment with your present and a growing anxiety towards the future. You probably want to go back and prevent yourself from saying that one stupid thing, or to stand up to that school yard bully who made you feel like nothing, or to stop your father from walking out on you. You probably think that if that one thing never happened, you wouldn’t be such a fuck up in life and maybe one person on this god forsaken planet could actually learn to love you for you, and not this strange, damaged and decrepit creature that you’ve become.\\n\\nAt this point we would like to lighten the mood with a little time travel humor. What do you call a device designed to bring extinct herbs back from the past? A thyme machine. Ha ha, ha ha.\\n\\nBefore we lock the the cabin doors, we are legally obligated to do one final check of approval-- Do you wish to proceed with your time travel flight with us today?\",\"timestamp\":1633535724,\"title\":\"A Time Traveller's Pre-Flight Safety Briefing\"},\"digest\":\"PNnSzNqAJYThXIIpyIE94Zy6IUwMyHuf8ReledMukEw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd2F156bBed5e8cdFa0E853403A554a7e9fe692f4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_ocGU9uGMiWrrvBEZRIu35X4U2ktg18OUS4FKlR_JT4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wsaxaVCSXAqTBEdofF93Oe84Dv39SjR5nnIrODJMkUA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MS5HMRqMsSTEMMXvfQ-kxlz7-h8wwQIjnWr7JuKOeMzZgJLViJYbbC-xX3M471b38rvz3qBaOJwWzWXXfSu42g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x59c203b2e56d5698690d0ce8531c8657276d3227bae1b6435a0042bc13db532f78ea50c6633348eec1efed67face51e72a86afd2f7079155188a188ca26cbb021c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_ocGU9uGMiWrrvBEZRIu35X4U2ktg18OUS4FKlR_JT4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wsaxaVCSXAqTBEdofF93Oe84Dv39SjR5nnIrODJMkUA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PNnSzNqAJYThXIIpyIE94Zy6IUwMyHuf8ReledMukEw\"}"
