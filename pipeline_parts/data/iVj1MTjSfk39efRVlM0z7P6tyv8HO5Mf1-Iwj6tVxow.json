"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Bitcoin’s ranging market continues because the leading cryptocurrency has not gotten the momentum needed to go back to the all-time high (ATH) levels of $66,900 witnessed recently.\\n\\nBTC was hovering around $62,212 during intraday trading, according to ***[CoinMarketCap](https://blockchain.news/tag/CoinMarketCap)***. This consolidation has been partly prompted by funding rates [hitting](https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1456383319696818178) a monthly low.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, Santiment [believes](https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1456429005289058307) the current situation in the Bitcoin market is because investors are not yet salivating to buy the dip opportunity.  \\n\\nNevertheless, market analyst Matthew Hyland recently [acknowledged](https://blockchain.news/analysis/bitcoin-might-explode-soon-bollinger-bands-continue-to-shrink) that the consolidating BTC market was a ticking time bomb, given that the Bollinger Bands (BB) had shrunk to levels last seen in October 2020 when the price was at $10,000.  \\n\\n**Big money moves have engulfed the Bitcoin market**\\n\\nDespite the current ranging market, big-money moves have dominated the Bitcoin network for the last two months. Market analyst Sam Rule [explained](https://twitter.com/samjrule/status/1456023117709692931):\\n\\n> *“Big money moving around the Bitcoin network over the last two months. $1M+ volume accounts for 81.56% of all transfer volume. $10M+ volume accounts for 61.7%.”*\\n\\nFurthermore, the share of whales [moving](https://twitter.com/JanWues/status/1456027114847809541) Bitcoin on-chain has been increasing.\\n\\n**49% of Bitcoin supply is held by entities with more than 1,000 BTC**\\n\\n[According](https://twitter.com/TXMCtrades/status/1455339456072912899) to an on-chain analyst under the pseudonym TXMC:\\n\\n> *“About half (49%) of all Bitcoin is held by entities with >1K BTC. \\\\* 26% of that half are held by all Exchanges. (13% of all BTC). Those exchanges serve an est. >100M customers globally. \\\\* 20% of that half are owned by miners (10% of all BTC).”*\\n\\nTherefore, miners and crypto exchanges take up the lion’s share of these entities. \\n\\nMeanwhile, BTC’s illiquid supply shock [broke](https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1456322805126074372) its 2021 highs.\\n\\nThis is bullish because it creates a supply deficit, and if demand rises, the price is expected to increase. \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1636177083,\"title\":\"Bitcoin Funding Hits a Monthly Low as Consolidation Continues\"},\"digest\":\"5AnShIWaevjVpzDso4cULPshUkXwOJN2JsmaiZzJpPg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD6f64a68E9435397C393FE9A7d7AA684a304e0f2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5bqVNud_LIyoFvYPHXNMahBjMjIdfnHE3Wu_oV2lRdQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dhO1pLnAh9XhVFG3suSRFbOSbgh3m8PAC6t3dlpTYzs\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2D3-MiNAFfpB5Dwt8kcfM6RhjjnestRxuMQXfrLcXAGbLv2Um8rVm1M1T_YKymp4sO-4I4IUEEN2RWCZOle-Yg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa75a3807108007e0d313027181c452b62b9aefe1a4744e7d8eb50a90b366cfce2667e720cc90608020ef92a14685fd4682c80cb9b295e1c5daaf75f2f94c789e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5bqVNud_LIyoFvYPHXNMahBjMjIdfnHE3Wu_oV2lRdQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dhO1pLnAh9XhVFG3suSRFbOSbgh3m8PAC6t3dlpTYzs\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5AnShIWaevjVpzDso4cULPshUkXwOJN2JsmaiZzJpPg\"}"
