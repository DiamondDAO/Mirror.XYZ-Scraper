"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*wz4naNagbkY6EuRX.jpg)\\n\\nHey friends 👋\\n\\nAs many of you know, I’ve really become obsessed with the world of cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (DeFi) and I’m trying to learn all I can about it so I can write great content that’s educational and entertaining (and of course not financial advice), but what I’ve discovered is that the biggest barrier to entry is cost 😅\\n\\nI’m a small fry 🍟 That means that I don’t make a lot of money and have to focus on debt paydown and saving money in my journey towards financial independence 💰 But I think I’m a pretty unique writer, and I can explain things well and in a way that’s genuinely fun to read. So I had an idea.\\n\\nWhat if my fans help fund my experiments and I’ll use that money to experiment in DeFi and write all about it? 🤔 How does that sound? Hold on though, there’s more. I’m a big believer in making content that is interactive and fun and rewards those of you who generously support my art, that’s why I came up with something that I think you’re gonna like 🎁\\n\\nIntroducing **Crypto Club Exclusives**: three exclusive series that ongoing supporters can access: **Rec’d**,\\\\*\\\\* Know Your Coin,\\\\*\\\\* **Crypto Misadventures** ✨\\n\\n## Rec’d\\n\\nRec’d is both a **[homophonic pun](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/what-is-a-pun-learn-about-the-different-types-of-puns-in-literature-and-tips-on-how-to-write-a-great-pun)** meant to sound like **[rekt](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/rekt)** and a common **[internet shorthand for the word “recommended”](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Rec%27d)** 🤓 This series is exactly that: recommendations for cool educational sites, podcasts, youtube channels, and wherever else you can learn more about DeFi and hopefully not get rekt 🤞\\n\\n## Know Your Coin\\n\\nThis series will aim to provide a bit of education around some of the coins and protocols I personally find super interesting and promising 👨‍🏫 There will not be any financial advice, buy/sell “alerts”, nor pumping here; just brief write-ups and links to learn more so that you can be an informed citizen of the DeFi ecosystem 🌍 And that in turn will probably help you make better financial decisions 🤓\\n\\n## Crypto Misadventures\\n\\nAnd of course, *[la pièce de résistance](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/piece-de-resistance)*, **Crypto Misadventures**, where I take the money you’ve generously provided as support for the blog and waste it on poorly-thought-out attempts at FOMOing my broke ass into DeFi projects that excite me 😂 Now, I’m pretty sure I’m obligated to say that **this is not financial advice, it is merely for entertainment**. So it might as well be entertaining right? 😂 No, but really, while this project is not intended to make me rich, I will try not to squander your generous contributions. The projects I experiment with will be unique, interesting, and promising in one or more ways.\\n\\nJust remember, I’m not a mutual fund. If you support, I want you to do so because you like the content I create, not because you expect an ROI.\\\\*\\\\* I’m an artist dammit!\\\\*\\\\* 👨‍🎨 What I can say is that I will use the majority of the funds provided by supporters towards buying cryptocurrency that I can make content about.\\n\\n**Update:** This content used to be paywalled for supporters. I wanted to provide content that was special and felt like a reward for those who chose to support. As I transition to Medium and Mirror, I’ve decided to drop the paywalls and hope that my fans will still generously support. Here the bonus will simply be more regular content. I will try to create a bonus in the future for supporters too, whether it be NFTs, giveaways, or other. That is TBD, and I make no promises.\\n\\nSo that’s my pitch: help make this blog sustainable and I’ll try to provide you with ongoing value. I’m interested enough in researching and writing about crypto and have made quite a bit of content on my super limited budget. What I need now is just some fuel for the fire 🔥 Then we can go to the moon 🚀\\n\\nYou in? 🤝\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nDid you enjoy this post? You can **[buy me a crypto coffee](https://www.buymeacryptocoffee.xyz/0x4d85e4f760fb58e380f02657ae5aafb8bd010601)** (Polygon or Ethereum) ☕️  I’m also available on **[ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/thumbsup)** for those who prefer to support in fiat. In Canada I accept support via Wealthsimple Cash: $thumbsup\\n\\nLastly I’ve set up thumbsupfinance.eth and thumbsupfinance.crypto to accept Bitcoin, Nano, Doge, Tezos, and more. Every bit helps me make more content 💖\",\"timestamp\":1639538740,\"title\":\"Introducing Crypto Club Exclusives (No Longer So Exclusive)\"},\"digest\":\"MNSOfir0kQhWUYzaOaO51bgRoQKk5JouH_hQiOpcWg4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4d85e4F760fb58E380f02657AE5Aafb8bd010601\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GJ07XkTvvtIz4d9Ecx3OEOJPuql-jBBatmCZtSQa1mQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VQ76Ir62rbxC1ZlPCh3itlzDwNd1Ud8G7iWf1UGnP-c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TRuCmOi8afsXXt3vkVba0YPzhwjoI8Zt5teM419UJNO4mEccD3g0fZVo6urmH3z-C4yRZeN7cND2pNgDtXOeaA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb00d27d0a09453c722e310ee9d08db2c14f4a71028e34076fbec0336228b08d754346a54f5ac46cbd68881f35ed8344d82eced30e30a4d7910d682384451c00f1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GJ07XkTvvtIz4d9Ecx3OEOJPuql-jBBatmCZtSQa1mQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"VQ76Ir62rbxC1ZlPCh3itlzDwNd1Ud8G7iWf1UGnP-c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"utrrjpJbOtEQlYXpZGMBxh9X7iQBPBBLx9RKl-NqnNs\"}"
