"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Disclaimer: It’s November 2021, I’m sitting in Athens, Greece, thinking about how to explain Web 3 to friends and family who keep asking about it. I decided to write up a couple of examples, this here is the introduction. I don’t code, so the following is not a technical description. My perspective is one of a professional dilettante who studied law, built and sold an innovative real estate company and then became a musician. I own some cryptocurrencies and experiment around with the apps available. It’s an incomplete rundown, I deliberately left some angles out to not overcomplicate it. If this text helps your thinking or if you think it’s wrong, please reach out to [luki.eth](https://twitter.com/scrptdfntsy) on twitter and lets discuss.*\\n\\ntldr: Bitcoin & Ethereum introduce the internet native equivalents of ownership, identity, scarcity and contractual obligations.\\n\\nLet’s start with [Chris Dixon](https://cdixon.org/)’s summary of how Web 3 is different from its predecessors:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1459036992050716697](https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1459036992050716697)\\n\\nIt’s a very short definition, so let me elaborate.\\n\\n* Web 1 was a one way street. You went to a webpage to read some news, maybe send a couple of emails. The content was provided by the company that ran the website you were surfing. It was kind of unclear at the time how things were going to be monetized.\\n* Web 2 was a two way street, services like Facebook. You went there to read the content your friends posted and to upload pictures of your food. While you and your friends created content, Facebook provided the platform for it and monetized. Through the leverage of 2 billion users it became the trillion dollar company it is today. The value accrued to Facebook because the system is designed in a way where it was impossible for you to own the fruits of your interactions.\\n* Web 3 is a structurally new form of internet that is not just a two way street, but one where you can own the restaurant on the corner too.\\n\\nI assume you’ve heard about [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/de/). I’m going to rehash the basics because the fundamentals are vital for understanding Web 3.\\n\\nBitcoin is a computer program that has a basic but robust set of functionalities:\\n\\n* It lets user create a finite amount (21m) of BTC, a digital token, in a predefined manner over time,\\n* it lets users obtain and move those tokens between participants of the network,\\n* it also makes users run a ledger to keep track of those tokens,\\n* and it allows all of the above to happen in a relatively secure environment on an infinite amount of computers everywhere on the globe, in real time, without a single party regulating anyones access to the network.\\n\\nThis basic set of functionalities is enough to keep the world debating Bitcoin’s use-case and usefulness since its introduction 13 years ago. With Bitcoin not breaking over those 13 years I’m going to move ahead and just assume that the program works as designed and will focus on three implications that derive from that. I call them the three mindfucks of Bitcoin.\\n\\nSummed up in one sentence, the three mindfucks of Bitcoin translate into “I own something of value.” which is a very familiar notion offline but a very strange one online. Let’s unbundle.\\n\\n**Ownership**, the first mindfuck of Bitcoin. Prior to Bitcoin, the internet did not have any function that made native ownership possible. The closest thing to ownership online was the concept of intellectual property enforced through offline legal systems. Let’s say you use Instagram (a Web 2 service) to upload an image. While the image is viewed and interacted with online, its ownership is attributed to you offline in the form of intellectual property rights. Online there is no way of proving it is yours. Why? Because there is no ledger. Without a ledger anyone can copy/paste anything and redistribute it. Bitcoin’s ledger changes the game because the transactions noted in the ledger can track where each bitcoin is from the moment it’s created. If the ledger doesn’t attribute any Bitcoin to you, you don’t have any, as simple as that. The knowledge created through a ledger (what when where) is a precondition to ownership. Now ownership in itself doesn’t necessarily drive value to the thing you own. You need the second mindfuck of Bitcoin for that:\\n\\n**Scarcity**. It’s a mindfuck because it’s literally the opposite of what we thought the internet was good for. The internet as we’ve come to understand it, is at its core a very elaborate mechanism for networking and file sharing. Files are digital objects and are infinitely duplicable, usually for free. Supply and demand dictates that if you can copy something infinitely, the object has little to no value. In order to drive value you need a mechanism of authentication that proves the object’s scarcity. Why are Da Vinci’s paintings valuable while photocopies of his paintings are not? Because there are only 20 paintings, but an infinite amount of photocopies. In order to make objects valuable, their supply has to be finite. Bitcoin does this through capping its maximum supply at 21M. That scarcity is one precondition to value. In addition you need demand, the existence of which the last decade has proven.\\n\\nWe’ve established that Bitcoin introduced online native ownership and has imbued the things you own with value through scarcity, but there is a third prerequisite for you to own something of value: You need to be you! **Identity** is the third mindfuck of Bitcoin. Prior to Bitcoin you did not have an identity online, you only had a username. The difference is simple: The two are distinguished by ownership. The actions of your identity accrue to you and you alone, while the actions of your username accrue to the service provider you got your username from. For example: When you check into a hotel in Paris, New York or London, you always check in with the same personal identification. Online (in Web 2 that is), for every service you check into, be it Instagram, Pinterest, Amazon, Uber or whatever else, you create an individual username and password. The interactions you have with one service don’t accrue to your username on the other. This presents a problem, because you cannot take ownership of your actions if you are a new entity with every party you interact with. A real identity is more like the offline version. It is portable and valid across different services. Bitcoin solves this problem by assigning you an address within Bitcoins ledger. This address accrues all interaction you have within the network and thus lets you take ownership of your digital identity.\\n\\nThe importance of these three mindfucks can not be overstated. They are fundamental to why Web 3 will drive an incredible amount of value back to its users and change the structure of how we interact with online services. Bitcoin translated these ownership, scarcity and identity into online native processes and that is unprecedented.\\n\\nThere is a fourth mindfuck in the wonderful world of Web 3 and it is the fourth cornerstone of business. It was introduced by another computer program that was built on the back of Bitcoins technological innovations and enhanced them. In addition to the three concepts above, [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) introduced the online native equivalent of **contractual obligations**. It’s the same story: Offline we are very familiar with contracts, we all use them every day, implicitly or explicitly. Online they are a novelty.\\n\\nThe business opportunities that arise by natively integrating the above concepts online are mind bogglingly huge. My assumption is that offline identity, ownership and contractual obligations enable most, if not all of our economic activity while scarcity drives their value. Web 3 is currently in the process of bringing all of them online in a native, transparent and verifiable way. What does this mean for how the internet and world will look when all this is widely implemented? I might just take some guesses in the subsequent articles.\",\"timestamp\":1637141399,\"title\":\"Making sense of Web 3\"},\"digest\":\"5TUa0KgJ_3_jSM7nmuzzClFN2mC1atRTXHyS8LBkmeo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1b33a20eC0b319Ba17F5f0bC4A80EFFbc38d4F81\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Pn7BxyZAcY80d7gKIUye1o-xLrz_5yzg5oceCuGoUh8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cmwaQWimxYALpckDJ1J-IdP_Bed68jnCTelSDdzVoE8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0Bgz40lGt934mrW7xpm1DFMPO9mNJLw9uH8km1jz3XveJHlt9OGRfNRstgioWZvaAwYYjkWXTt1Lp5C69gth4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc568dd1b21b87f202f4152de3fd3730cbe33cc16242fccfb9d612d6271b1d95c7023617fd183cbfd88f0026f2cddf559a55a907a6fe5eb373ec6b5b9f881fd461b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Pn7BxyZAcY80d7gKIUye1o-xLrz_5yzg5oceCuGoUh8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cmwaQWimxYALpckDJ1J-IdP_Bed68jnCTelSDdzVoE8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"V-CqmMrTDianEc-sDEmRDpZ6CH9UVH3TKJnZonB_aJg\"}"
