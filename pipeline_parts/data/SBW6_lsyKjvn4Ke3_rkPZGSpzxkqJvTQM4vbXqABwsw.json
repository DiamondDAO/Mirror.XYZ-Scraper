Shopify also has a nifty little [business name generator](https://www.shopify.com/tools/business-name-generator).\\n2. **Brand Voice**: Take a [brand personality quiz](http://brandpersonalityquiz.com/) to define your archetype. Copywriter Chanti Zak also has a nifty [brand voice quiz](https://www.chantizak.com/brand-voice-quiz/) on her website which I found quite illuminating. A more comprehensive resource would be Hubspot’s [guide for developing a brand identity](https://blog.hubspot.com/agency/develop-brand-identity).\\n3. **Colour Palette**: Use a palette generator such as [Coolors](https://coolors.co/2d2d2a-353831-38423b-3f5e5a-20fc8f), [Colormind](http://colormind.io/), [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) or [this spiffy little gadget from Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) which allows you to upload an image and extract a palette from it.\\n4. **Logo & Identity Design**: There is no dearth of logo makers out there. Some of my go-tos include [Hatchful](https://hatchful.shopify.com/) by Shopify, Canva’s [free logo maker](https://www.canva.com/create/logos/) or [this logo creator](https://www.squarespace.com/logo) by Squarespace. Both [Canva](http://www.canva.com/) and [Pixlr](https://pixlr.com/) are great image editing tools.\\n5. **Brand Story/Narrative**: Hubspot’s [guide to building a brand story](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/brand-story) and Creative Supply’s [Brand Story Canvas](https://creativesupply.com/en/resources/brand-story-canvas/) which includes a downloadable template. Given the importance of this step in building a brand, an investment here would be worth every dollar. Even though it’s not free\\\\*, I recommend [Storytech](https://www.storyte.ch/) which is an interactive brand story crafting platform that guides you step by step through the process of getting a world-class brand narrative.\\n6. **Miscellaneous**: Here are a smattering of tools that can help in your journey. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a great place for finding typefaces.

A Digital Marketing Strategy further extends this definition by incorporating data and technology along with carefully selected tactics to achieve and even extend that goal (e.g. from Customer Acquisition to Retention, Repurchase, Advocacy, etc.)\\n\\nIn his book [Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0307886239/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_KFW9ZF7D3QA7GCGK4BGZ), Richard Rumelt describes the kernel of a good strategy as containing three elements:\\n\\n```\\nThe Kernel of a Strategy1. A diagnoses that defines the challenge.2. A guiding policy (or principles) for dealing with the challenge.3. A set of coherent actions to accomplish the policy.This article by Jeff Zych captures the essence of the book and makes for an insightful read.\\n```\\n\\n> A good marketing strategy then must identify the challenge to be overcome and design a way to overcome it.\\n\\nHubspot’s [digital strategy guide](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/digital-strategy-guide) is a great resource to start with.

UX Strategy helps consistently and accurately deliver the intended user experience to every touch-point where users interact with your product or service. UX Design isn’t as much about aesthetics so much as it is about keeping the user at the heart of the solution design process.\\n\\n1. Some useful resources in learning how to create a UX Strategy include [this article from MentoMate](https://mentormate.com/blog/what-is-user-experience-strategy/) about User Experience Strategy\\n2. [UX Strategy Toolkit](https://userexperiencestrategy.com/) from Jaime Levy includes [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BhjXkbwhFWWjPbtxax1t3IW7TrZ9rEhYtO2wEYIRVuQ/edit#gid=120881635) to document competitive research/analysis, user research studies, and funnel design strategies.\\n\\n## Create Marketing Assets\\n\\n![Photo by Visual Design on Unsplash](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*uZgN2KVNUSR54EsXtCDplg.jpeg)\\n\\n[^ Back to the top](#3615)\\n\\nOnce the brand identity has been defined and the strategy worked out, you’re ready to get executing on those plans. There is a multitude of ways in which you can bring to life your strategic approach. This section deals with individual tactical elements such as websites, apps, social media, marketing automation, CRM, SEO, paid media, measurement and analytics. I expect this section to be a work in progress and new tools to be added periodically.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Web & App Development (Design, WYSIWYG, No/Low Code)\\\\*\\\\*Web Design is the process of orchestrating and strategically bringing together aesthetic and authored elements in crafting a website. Websites are integral components of digital strategies and the process of web design incorporates translating those strategies into tangible elements such as content, layouts and visuals. Increasingly, web design today uses themes/templates as starting points and seldom involves building something from the ground up.\\n\\n**Concept, Prototypes, Wireframes, Design Systems**\\n\\n![Photo by HalGatewood.com on Unsplash](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*5lLGYJXaxAKqdevef94-QQ.jpeg)\\n\\nThis stage of web design offers integrated tools that can transform simple ideas in your head into working prototypes and much more. [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) is a design toolkit which offers a feature unrestricted 30 days trial and [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) which has a forever free tier which should be more than sufficient to get you started. Both these tools are industry standards at this point for low/high fidelity wireframing, building design systems and prototyping. Another powerful multi-dimensional tool is [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) which offers a free starter plan with layouts, design, prototyping and animation features.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Building a Website\\\\*\\\\*For nearly two decades, open-source Content Management Systems (CMSes) have dominated the web-scape and truly revolutionized how we build and manage websites.\\n\\nWordPress is the undisputed leader here — used by 39% of the top websites on the internet and also happens to be my top recommendation in this category.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*2-c4UDTzkVmNySh5.png)\\n\\nThe WordPress community maintains a massive ecosystem of templates, extensions and plugins making it one of the most powerful and customisable website builders, period. There are several ways to establish a web presence using WordPress:\\n\\n1. Create a WordPress website using a free [Wordpress.com](http://wordpress.com/) account which comes with dozens of free themes. This is likely to be the easiest option for most users. As your website needs grow, it will be well worth upgrading to one of their premium plans.\\n2. Set up and host WordPress using [the forever free tier of Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/free). This is for advance users and provides extensive control. Some helpful resources to accomplish this include this [GCP setup guide from TerminalBytes](https://www.terminalbytes.com/forever-free-wordpress-blog-with-your-own-domain-on-google-cloud/), or this [step by step instructional video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG9kv5-5bPI&ab_channel=UTECHPIA) from Utechpia.\\n3.

The right agency is able to continually invest time and resources in identifying, curating and in some cases even developing the right solutions/products to provide brands an advantage over their competitors.\\n\\n> *While remaining objective, unencumbered and decoupled from the marketer’s blind spots, the right agency can be the voice of reason and innovation in the stasis laden world of traditional marketing.*\\n\\nA well-informed brand marketer can be a strong ally and partner for the right agency. Speaking the same language and unified in objective instead of the agency having to educate and in some cases spoon feed the next course of action. This partnership of equals can potentially create an outcome several orders of magnitudes greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nThis puts an added burden of responsibility on the agency. Those that don’t create value at scale for their clients will soon become irrelevant and be left behind. Perhaps what is happening at the network agency level is an early warning system, a canary in the coal mine if you will that agencies need to smarten up and shed all preconceived notions held onto — sometimes simply due to tradition.\\n\\nAlready independent offshoots are sprouting up all over vying to optimise and turn every little sliver of the customer’s journey into a product. Whatever is on offer and done poorly, will in a matter of time become a specialised service provided by an expert. An expert-as-a-service (EaaS) if you will.\\n\\nThe writing is on the wall for marketers and agencies alike.
