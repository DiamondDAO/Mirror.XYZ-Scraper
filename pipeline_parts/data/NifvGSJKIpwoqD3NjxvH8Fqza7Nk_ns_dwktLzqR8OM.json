There is also no shortage of [DAO catalogues](https://daocentral.com/) out there already and more will inevitably be added. These posts, therefore, aim to neither be particularly original, nor are they an effective or comprehensive DAO discovery tool. Instead, as I get into this practice, I hope to be able to settle on a way of understanding what any given DAO is about, to always have [something](https://twitter.com/successionreact/status/1460384128117977093?s=20) to write about, and yes, mint some [NFTs](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/guide/nfts) in the process!\\n\\n# Nouns DAO\\n\\n[nouns.wtf](https://nouns.wtf/)\\n\\n### Intro & Funds\\n\\n[https://opensea.io/assets/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03/0](https://opensea.io/assets/0x9c8ff314c9bc7f6e59a9d9225fb22946427edc03/0)\\n\\nIn the beginning there was a [Noun](https://nouns.notion.site/A-Brief-Introduction-to-Nouns-90485892d0c54ef1be05abf0ecfc18da), and the Noun was‚Ä¶ a 32x32 pixel image minted as [ERC-721](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-721/) Ethereum NFT on [2021-08-08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events/2021_August_8), the event and the [compressed](https://nouns.notion.site/Noun-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507#6bbc1162af90427bad2dda63a3b31254) [base64](https://docs.python.org/3/library/base64.html)-encoded SVG image itself immortalized in block [129857](https://etherscan.io/block/12985732) (along with [a few other](https://etherscan.io/txs?block=12985732) transactions).\\n\\nOne of these NFTs gets generated every day and goes to an auction, the totality of the proceeds from which end up in the [Nouns DAO treasury](https://etherscan.io/tokenholdings?a=0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10).\\n\\nAs of writing, a total of **162 Nouns** have been generated and the treasury contains **16,931.8 Œû** or **\\\\~$64.4 mil**. For comparison, the estimated [2021 revenue for the city of East Cleveland](https://webgen1files1.revize.com/eastclevelandoh/Document_Center/Department/Finance%20Department/Financial%20Reports/Monthly%20Reports/2021/November%202021%20Financial%20Report.pdf) is at about **$13 mil**.\\n\\n![Nouns < 200 have governance benefits and at \\\\~$172k someone must really want this one](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/FOn-3402h8uMBNt8nWQw6.png?height=1104&width=2326)\\n\\n### Governance\\n\\nHow does the treasury get utilized? Through decisions arrived at with a [governance mechanism](https://future.a16z.com/building-and-running-a-dao-why-governance-matters/) consisting of [proposals](https://nouns.notion.site/Submit-a-Proposal-to-the-DAO-0605e2437e184eae82dc07c30bcd2ed9), of course!\\n\\nTo submit a proposal today, one needs to have 0.5% of the total NOUN supply, (effectively by anyone in possession of at least one Noun before Noun #200).\\n\\nThe more NOUNs you have, the more voting power you bring to the proposals.\\n\\nWith [30 proposals](https://nouns.wtf/vote) to date, some delightful ones include a proposal to [Send a Noun to the International Space Station](https://nouns.wtf/vote/28) and [one to name a recently discovered species of glass frog after Nouns](https://nouns.wtf/vote/16).\\n\\n**1 NOUN = 1 vote**, and one wallet can have multiple. Votes can be delegated to others, allowing for NOUN holders to rely on an aligned representative in all governance manners. If a NOUN holder sells their NFT, their vote goes with it.\\n\\nAdditionally, a set of 10 og wallets (known as *Nounders*) have control over the multisig, as well as absolute veto power over any proposal. The DAO promises that they will\\n\\n> \\\\[‚Ä¶\\\\] revoke this veto right when they deem it safe to do so. This decision will be based on a healthy noun distribution and a community that is engaged in the governance process.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OLt1CzWbWw6OJTh4P2T9o.png?height=1216&width=1860)\\n\\n### Protocol\\n\\n[https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/](https://github.com/nounsDAO/nouns-monorepo/)\\n\\nThe protocol for generating the art and running auctions is written as a combination of TypeScript and Solidity respectively, and is [decently documented](https://nouns.notion.site/Noun-Protocol-32e4f0bf74fe433e927e2ea35e52a507) inside of Notion. What stands out are the considerations around auction timing and the compression mechanism for the pixel art itself.\\n\\nThe Nouns DAO governance protocol is a fork of [Compound Governance](https://compound.finance/docs/governance).\\n\\n### Utility & verdict\\n\\n**TL;DR** `ngmi üëé`\\n\\n> Nouns are an experimental attempt to improve the formation of on-chain avatar communities. While projects such as [Cryptopunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks) have attempted to bootstrap digital community and identity, Nouns attempt to bootstrap identity, community, governance and a treasury that can be used by the community.\\n\\nSource: *WTF?* at nouns.wtf\\n\\n> I think we should be bold with the Nouns DAO¬†[treasury](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0BC3807Ec262cB779b38D65b38158acC3bfedE10). We should fund and cultivate a community of builders by experimenting, taking risks, and ultimately funding every high quality proposal that could lead to interesting culture and software (especially ‚Äòmiddleware‚Äô) on the Nouns protocol:\\n>\\n> * Centralized and decentralized APIs (let‚Äôs turn Noun o‚Äôclock into an internet-wide event)\\n> * Artwork that adds something new to the cultural conversation\\n> * Integrations with other Ethereum primitives and dapps\\n> * iOS and Android apps\\n> * Hackathons and Documentation\\n> * Things we‚Äôve never seen before\\n\\nSource: *The Nouns Virtuous Cycle* at [nouns.notion.site](https://nouns.notion.site/The-Nouns-Virtuous-Cycle-b7f5bf4ba69d47bb93ce07ef21bea8ee)\\n\\nIn addition to purely whimsical value of [generating permutations of visual attributes](https://nouns.wtf/playground), the bigger vision for the so-called virtuous cycle in the community is to fund a set of projects referred to as middleware using a governance mechanism to shortlist the ones that are worth building.\\n\\nWhat does it mean for a community if its governance token can be bought? Here I think the [top addresses by voting weight](https://compound.finance/governance/leaderboard) of Compound Finance itself can be informative:\\n\\n![Robert Leshner in #5 is the founder of Compound Labs](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zfk85dO4sHIZ-ch3iV3t7.png?height=848&width=2038)\\n\\nWhile the governance token does not *have* to be [tradable on the secondary market](https://docs.crafteconomy.io/tokenomics/exp), in practice quite a few [governance tokens](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/governance) today are, [including NOUNs](https://opensea.io/collection/nouns?search%5BsortAscending%5D=false&search%5BsortBy%5D=LAST_SALE_DATE), and it is a DAO configuration default I hope changes in 2022.\\n\\nWith a treasury this impressive it is difficult to imagine that the DAO will not survive in some shape or form (even if the bear arrives for ETH üß∏).\\n\\nHowever, lest we want to preserve the existing realities of wealth inequality, allow for self-dealing, and attacks by well-monied adversaries, any DAO whose governance token I can buy in troves will automatically not make it in my estimation (as far as reshaping organizations and society for the better), even with multisig failsafes and off-chain reputational incentives for the *Nounders*.\\n\\n[https://music.apple.com/us/album/cryptomnesia/1559912146?i=1559912153](https://music.apple.com/us/album/cryptomnesia/1559912146?i=1559912153)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641202066,\"title\":\"DAO EVERYDAYS 1: Nouns DAO\"},\"digest\":\"vAVpdvn1vcESgXj8SciC1RdcItqy5C3tpVyqiQbvieA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2387bd5F598F55B0702E82E5A687E608810308e9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1WiV-GyBkvRaguc14YEfCE0ZaS2cZjuGM5pvfEvnpmo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Nsw9tyc19hMLhw_nMbVOXZduuDoxkMyV_nNaVticHQE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"m6MCvm0mZ_mIl1VKivojyQXe3CBWbVxRp2J5ROQP3m1PAl5Jmb6vOdj3sc_v3jhYvJkzPBsGn0UkyIMVVlleJQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xef885e52fb8c4d637a11db03d7ed589bcf070bec7f8588b5e758d12773748a51484e5749a8729e2a62995efd785bccf686509c253f19a7458082c06bfc37fe7e1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1WiV-GyBkvRaguc14YEfCE0ZaS2cZjuGM5pvfEvnpmo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Nsw9tyc19hMLhw_nMbVOXZduuDoxkMyV_nNaVticHQE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WaWyt6o7jYl0j1-j0wal7M0X9kkBcrTza6pZo_IUCD0\"}"
