"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We businessmen must deeply understand this concept to help us make more money and run our business better. For example, some people think that war is an ugly act, and they feel cruel to see the number of people killed in the war. But I don’t know how many times more creatures we humans kill every day than the number of people killed in war.\\n\\nSome people may say that these beasts are low-level creatures with no thoughts. It's not a pity to die. So when one day, when aliens who are tens of thousands of times more intelligent than ours come to the earth, aliens see us as if we see mice and decide to turn us into their domestic animals. You can recall our own position-death is not a pity.\\n\\n```\\nNature will also promote the evolution of some things to counter the rapid reproduction of humans. For example, various new germs or untreatable diseases have claimed the lives of many people. If you are a vegetarian, don’t think that you don’t kill. Because the bowl of rice and vegetables you eat requires a lot of pesticides to kill a lot of bugs before you can eat them. And if you eat it, other creatures can't eat it. They lose a bite of food and they have to starve to death.\\n\\nBusinessmen must deeply realize that cruelty is cruelty. It’s not because we are educated that we are not cruel, but we are cruel and concealed. The law of evolution and balance of nature is that the weak eat the strong. The essence of competition is one thing to live and one thing to die. There is no possibility of coexistence. Everyone should understand how fierce the merger war in the Internet industry is during this period. This cruel law also comes from our genes.\\n\\nEven a newborn baby is born only after the weak and the strong. Because he needs to defeat many competitors, hundreds of millions of sperm must be sacrificed heroically before a child will be born.\\n\\nIf you go to a lot of zoos, live chickens are fed to tigers and lions. You can experience the domineering and bloody cruel scenes of the tiger \\\"swallowing the world\\\". Thank you, everyone, you can add me to Jiu Yi Lu Jiu Jiu Wu Jiu, I wish you all a fortune. Then, before leaving, I looked back at the tiger, sympathized with it, and murmured with it, knowing and recognizing heroes: \\\"This is the world of the strong, and it is also the rules of the game of nature. Winners and losers should not be the weak Any complaints\\\".\\n\\nBecause tigers and lions are expensive kings of beasts, they have also been conquered by our humans and become Chinese food or playthings.\\n\\nI know Liu Qiangdong from Jingdong Mall, Zhiyuan Yang from Yahoo, and Bill Gates from Microsoft. I've said it all by appointment. \\\"I don't like the feeling of losing, I like competition, and I like winning in competition.\\\" The tone of this sentence seems arrogant and arrogant. But showing the domineering lions and tigers, expressing the mentality of every strong man.\\n\\nI'm sure to say that a strong person must have the mentality of a strong person, and must understand that this world is the weak and the strong. Therefore, everyone should strengthen themselves, because if you lose, you will be beaten if you are behind, and you will die! This is the way to be a business and a man.\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1634803316,\"title\":\"The weak and strong food is the way of heaven\"},\"digest\":\"FhigW3rBTOULTvoPq2Ikpuy_1186ie3oDY4NKFN6HgI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0B27cE1053585ef548Cd78618Ee0b73D84246712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8-Lm3Bab_dzq_eMlpmPMNcKAmDVqiTyJtejak-lZ0zCgw2L_HHqegk3MyFC-oGH8aeqCilKNxGfteNSgxv91lg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d86f85b2660a8cb6873525924f9adb0c5f51dfb6229fed7a757ade2793c2f19347cb8076af39b12116743e30b34d1bacb42c80a0030cd272dd62c1ad0ad21081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"FhigW3rBTOULTvoPq2Ikpuy_1186ie3oDY4NKFN6HgI\"}"
