"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The term “network” gets used in a variety of ways. We have financial networks, computer networks, data networks, business networks, and of course, social networks.\\n\\nBut what are networks exactly? The classical definition for a network is a collective of two or more *nodes* (people, computers, objects) who are connected to each other in some form, and who do or do not share a variety of *edges* (attributes, relationships, etc.). But how does that translate to the networks we have in the real world? For example, in a computer network, you have the *nodes* (computers) and they are connected via a wireless or a wired/cable connection. They can also take specific roles in the network — like being a server that holds data or a PC that allows a user to connect to the network — these roles or features are called *edges*.\\n\\n**Networks can either be small — a two-person peer-to-peer network — or very large.** Think of the global financial network which is made up of billions of people, institutions, and middlemen. Depending on the size and the role that these networks play, they can become a powerful force in our society.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WYoz-AyLrd-ZmDtvZavGO.png?height=952&width=1400)\\n\\nBut why do these *networks* matter so much? This is a very important question to understand; it gives us a wider view on how our society functions. We all are part of networks. We are part of social networks, big and small, that make up our families, friends, and acquaintances. Most of us are part of one or more financial networks, by having a bank account or by being part of the cryptocurrency industry. We are also part of bigger institutional networks like nation-states, or supranational networks like the EU or the UN.\\n\\n**These networks are vast and many people that are part of those networks might not necessarily understand that they are**. Most of these networks have distinct features and play some kind of societal role in our lives. Unfortunately, they often come with a hierarchy. In a financial network, high net worth individuals have more control than low net worth individuals. In a social network, people with a high amount of *edges* (connections, followers, etc.) have a greater influence than others.\\n\\nTake a second and think about the variety of networks that you are naturally a part of, and how much they influence your life and your role in society.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4RCU7BKB6C3R-r5KApkur.png?height=933&width=1400)\\n\\nNow that you understand what networks are and why they matter, we can come to the interesting part. Around the early 2000s, a business innovation gradually emerged. It was fueled by the PC and internet revolution that was taking over the world. Many people that worked in this new industry were fascinated by the incredible growth in adoption of these products that had not been seen before the rise of the internet. On their quest to find out what fueled this rapid growth, they coined a new term that would soon become the new buzzword for the start-up space: **Network Effects**.\\n\\nTo avoid any confusion, we are going to start by defining what *Network Effects* are. **A product or service is subject to positive *network effects* when increased usage by any user increases the value of the product or service for other users.**\\n\\nBut Network Effects are not equal and there is no single Network Effect. You can have User Network Effects, Business Network Effects, Sales Network Effects, and more. Generally, Network Effects are divided into 5 subcategories: Direct Network Effects, Indirect Network Effects, Two-sided Network Effects, Local Network Effects, and Compatibility and Standards. Instead of making this section lengthy by explaining each of them separately, we will refer you to an article which was written by one of the most prominent Network Effect researchers: <http://oz.stern.nyu.edu/io/network.html>.\\n\\n**So why are Network Effects so powerful?** Well as the definition explains, increased usage of the network increases the value for every other node in the network. This usually leads to the hockey stick style growth that you can observe with some of the biggest technological innovations of our time: from Google to Facebook and from Uber to Ethereum. All of them share one important factor that fueled their incredible growth: **Network Effects**.\\n\\nLet us take Ethereum as an example — Ethereum started off as the first Layer 1 Blockchain to support Smart Contracts. In the beginning, it had very few users and very few developers. But as more and more people got into crypto, the user and developer base for Ethereum exploded — this growth was fueled by both direct and indirect **Network Effects**. The Network Effects can be observed by the appreciation of Ether’s price. The more users that joined, the more the value of Eth increased — which rewarded early users and created more value for the entire Network. However, there is an even more important indirect **Network Effect** that Ethereum is benefitting from: the more users that joined, more developers that got interested in building dApps (decentralized applications) on Ethereum and vice versa; the more dApps that were built on Ethereum, the more users joined the Network. As you can see, these effects have powerful implications.\\n\\nEven though there are many Layer 1 alternatives to Ethereum today (with better functionality and lower cost…) Ethereum still remains the premier Layer 1 in the Blockchain Ecosystem. This is because Ethereum has incredibly strong **Network Effects**. The interesting thing about Network Effects is that they have two causal effects. They lower the barrier of entry for new users but they also increase the barrier of exit for existing users. The latter is the reason why superior Layer 1's have such a hard time keeping up with Ethereum.\\n\\nAnother great Example for adverse Network Effects is Facebook. Online Social Networks have some of the most powerful Network Effects that exist. Not only does the network become more valuable to you when more of your friends join in, it adversely makes it a lot harder for you to leave said network. This is the reason why 2.3 Billion people still use Facebook even though the company itself is generally scrutinized. Facebook benefits from the incredibly high barrier of exit that prevents their users to switch to a competitor.\\n\\n**Network Effects as a business innovation has been one of the most powerful tools in Silicon Valley’s repertoire to build giants of the industry.** They usually lead to “Winner takes most industries;” which is why Facebook is still the most dominant Social Network, Google has a monopoly in Search, and Netflix dominates the streaming market.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1ffMqyvOpW1ewCAEd3Zaa.png?height=933&width=1400)\\n\\n**In order for Web3 to succeed, we need to build strategic Network Effects into our products.** They are the most powerful tool to build incredibly successful products. **There is just one problem: Network Effects only work at scale.** You need to reach a certain network size to reap the benefits of Network Effects. But in order to to use them at all, we need to engineer them into the product long before we actually reach that scale. This is often overlooked by many projects. Knowing which network effects your product can leverage, can make or break your business in the long term.\\n\\nTo build a powerful Network that can deliver value to our community, we need to think about how we can build around Network Effects before we build our products. This will help us once we get into the Blitzscaling phase. If we as the Web3 community do not realize how to build those networks, then we will have no chance against the Web2 Giants — they know and they have known for decades. They have built their businesses on Network Effects and they will attempt to do it again. But if we educate our communities about Networks and leverage the power of community, we can beat them at their own game. **If specific industries are Winner takes most, which they will be, we need to make sure that the Winner is someone who shares our values and who is part of the community itself.** Otherwise, we will lose one fight after another to the Incumbents of Web2.\",\"timestamp\":1642641952,\"title\":\"Networks — What they are and why they matter\"},\"digest\":\"R1JBFQTVjQrTukwKCEqPJqLrJKlAGNImi3xhNwZQcMw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA0125FDcb3e65A2cEaDF459B8d4454167eC51D7E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-nOFWbkoK9PSLA3JDGRX-wnsCUbJymikqvelk-BkrdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_r3lsgwQAf_faUv6tkrWGThd1jGAREcBaAehkGlbg2Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"j5buW7-xYloNhgmngCBMgH0E4gHBSOav1Jy1XHDp_T728xhUoq-sVxLSH7ZdAtzKvbBOeHL9p3kmHyCddcr8kg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9e868e13b03919aa7bb14a324934ade02f141ff34c3832628a7251b1f53959e439822cbf823013c789f1a73c0946eae86ae0434369d0307ee7b367ed7fa426b11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-nOFWbkoK9PSLA3JDGRX-wnsCUbJymikqvelk-BkrdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_r3lsgwQAf_faUv6tkrWGThd1jGAREcBaAehkGlbg2Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"R1JBFQTVjQrTukwKCEqPJqLrJKlAGNImi3xhNwZQcMw\"}"
