"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*This goal of this project is to prove that all one reasonably needs to be traditionally successful is will, perspective, and an internet connection.*  \\n I have long felt this way and decided to embark on this mission as a first person account of my journey: the thoughts I have, the tools I use, and where I end up.\\n\\n## Metrics\\n\\nThe first order of business is to define metrics for failure, success, and excellence in this project, as well as some terms I use in the mission statement.\\n\\n* *all* and *reasonably* \\\\~ I am a kid with a laptop with some ether in her pocket. This is all you need to be.\\n* *traditionally successful* \\\\~ a healthy body, rich skillset, liberal arts education, purpose\\n* *excellence* \\\\~ within this six months my work reaches reaches > 10,000 people  \\n* *success* \\\\~ I have built enough skill and reputation to continue the project comfortably and with expectation of upward mobility\\n* *failure* \\\\~ anything else\\n\\n## This\\n\\nThis will be a log of my journey. The good, the bad, most importantly the real. The goal outlined in this document will remain the same but the means will change as will how I use this journal. Some things I would like this to be is 1) an inspiration for others to follow in their own way, 2) a place to curate open source resources, 3) a place to share the emotions that come with this journey. Expect links to tweets, book recs (and notes) links to online courses, newsletters, that sort. From time to time I might release a project, I encourage you to the same. \\n Think of this like Meditations by Marcus Aurelius but instead of being a roman emperor Iâ€™m a kid and instead of being humble I am arrogant\\n\\n## The Path\\n\\nI have found that structure is often necessary when creating your own environment for success; this is how I will start. The idea is to spend some of each day preserving health, then segregating different types of work heavily. Mornings will be spent cooking, reading, and goal setting; by 9AM I am awake with a plan of attack. The rest of the day will comprise of one of three forms of work: office work, learning, and interpersonal work (meetings, writing messages, community involvement).\\n\\nNow is the time for this experiment because the internet is at a tipping point. Web3 is enabling decentralized governance, finance, and infrastructure. Adoption is high enough that most all people sharing relevant ideas are connected by fiberglass. And there are kids like me, who have grown up internet native. \",\"timestamp\":1641632725,\"title\":\"Finding a Path\"},\"digest\":\"YI1vqC0qjZkb4g-3TKzJ7WQyPGVDQd2KgUgofV9qHeI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfB4A20f9c6D8562D1165e5f26F19a8E662046e4c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_tal3rXRaEPQyvfiPCqmArKQgU8UK8u1pp_mrjIV3Mc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jERl5Jc-3t35pBZuetgZyF_7ybYTOk8ggTQFgOIVu-A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Gr5qvynT9C05TxVPv72HNkHKDfAWowfKBlpsDWgWU19qulZo49PeuftDu6O3iDjv0_vhOkPfFMDm2FAtxyazyQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5314bbd8546a2ef6421ace2cbe85a77865e1c993151b107dd43841af2c2b41c7e02357592fda7090c62fa4a591c67699fadd57f0c13a2bfc56c6a5a7f21feec1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_tal3rXRaEPQyvfiPCqmArKQgU8UK8u1pp_mrjIV3Mc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jERl5Jc-3t35pBZuetgZyF_7ybYTOk8ggTQFgOIVu-A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YI1vqC0qjZkb4g-3TKzJ7WQyPGVDQd2KgUgofV9qHeI\"}"
