"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### I remember…\\n\\njust a few years back as we were all first on boarding to web3 and being introduced to “crypto”, the user experience - while different - was for the most part straight forward (though limiting). The path that I (and most people I was in contact with) took was to find an exchange to first buy some cryptocurrency from. Typically Bitcoin or Ethereum or both was purchased and either left in the exchange’s wallet or (as we were all so well advised to do) was transferred to a wallet that was stored less centrally than by the exchanges’ wallets. In 2017 when I made one of my first official wallets, I used Metamask, Coinbase and Ledger Live in combination - to buy and then reallocate my tokens. (Though I remember some people were using Toshi as well - as dapps were beginning to emerge more into view). The point being, there was a pretty standard process (at least within my circle) of buying cryptocurrency from an exchange, then transferring it to another wallet for longer storage. At that time, there was of course many new blockchains emerging and many other tokens for purchase as well, but in my  exploratory phase I did not venture past the initial purchase and hold step. For at this time, this exercise was to learn about how to navigate through the process of accessing, transferring and storing tokens.\\n\\n### the next step along the path was with NFTs…\\n\\nand I remember reading often through Fred Wilson’s blog, that him and his partners at USV were fascinated by various “digital trading cards” utilizing blockchains. This concept peaked my interest but still felt quite foreign to me because of how tedious and poor the UX was in order to acquire any of them… I figured these “things” were to be kept in this walled garden with the VC insiders, but my understanding of what they were excited about finally became clear when I read their following blog explaining their rationale for investing into CryptoKitties, in March of 2018. This was the early eureka moment for many concerning NFTs and the concept of “tokenization” (in my opinion)…\\n\\n[https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/03/cryptokitties-2/](https://www.usv.com/writing/2018/03/cryptokitties-2/)\\n\\nWhat I remember being so compelling about CryptoKitties was that it provided tangible utility to the previous “crypto” related arrangements I (and most people at the time) had  just set up. This was the on boarding mechanism -  I easily was able to connect my Metamask wallet to CryptoKitties to make an account, and from there I began learning about the different attributes each kitten had. This process led to the understanding between the different types of crypto related tokens that could exist (ERC-20, ERC-721… etc) and most importantly the power of smart contracts and what that could mean for building other services (with more functional utility than digital cats) that could push the adoption of web3 apps even further. The user experience, for the first real time, seemed clear and direct. However, I still did not make a purchase of a CryptoKitty as there were surely unknowns then about smart contracts, security, gas fees etc. There were still barriers to the UX, and by no means was this an easily adoptable game without some intermediate level crypto literacy. Albeit a major step in pushing web3 apps forward, there were still gaps in the UX.\\n\\n### Fast forward to now…\\n\\nand the web3, NFT and crypto ecosystem is drastically more advanced and evolved - but is still far from being easily adoptable with further UX hurdles that have to be overcome. Undoubtedly we can unpack a myriad of topics to discuss concerning whats changed within the crypto and web3 ecosystem in the past 3 years, but I’d like to highlight some key concepts to navigate around for the context of building a scaleable consumer facing service on web3 and the UX challenges that this task will face in the short term.\\n\\nCurrently at Peatix, the community and event management platform that I am a strategist and product manager for, we are focused on creating a smart contract protocol that will be community focused and allow for community organizers on our platform and other platforms to utilize. We feel it is extremely valuable to empower organizers and community members with access to more actual ownership in their communities and provide them with access to define clearer jurisdictions for community governance which blockchain powered services can provide. Peatix recognized that the emergence of the crypto and web3 space will be a resource to evolve the ways communities are built and maintained going forward, and so it became of great importance to its mission to help build this future’s infrastructure. It also now faces the challenge of integrating all of the aforementioned crypto components, which have historically been by design decoupled from legacy web2 apps and services, seamlessly into the UX of its current suite of applications.\\n\\nBy taking the steps now to “get ahead” so to say of the UX hurdle and establishing the understanding that this is a core problem to solve, it is far easier to begin to outline the attractive features of various blockchains and prioritize which functions will be necessary to build this protocol on top of.\\n\\n### “The Kickstarter model?”\\n\\nIt is with great excitement that we’ve seen another community focused company set out to develop a blockchain powered open protocol to empower its users.\\n\\n[https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/lets-build-whats-next-for-crowdfunding-creative-projects](https://www.kickstarter.com/articles/lets-build-whats-next-for-crowdfunding-creative-projects)\\n\\nAs Kickstarter mentions in their blog post above, they will be building this protocol on the Celo blockchain with a core objective to seamlessly integrate and migrate their current application to run through this protocol without any disruption in the UI and UX for their users.\\n\\nThis is the very key point for integrating a web3 app into a current legacy web2 service - and a point that I feel is not emphasized quite enough at the current moment. *It needs to integrate seamlessly to be successful at scale.*\\n\\n### UX’s moment …\\n\\nFrom the time I was browsing CryptoKitties to today, the web3 space has solved a ton of problems - and should be commended on such amazing progress. One of the most powerful advancements that was made was the alleviation of the some of the scaling issues (on Ethereum and Bitcoin’s blockchains) that layer 2 chains have assisted with. The result though has left a bit of a convoluted web of blockchains and tokens that need to be wrapped or bridged or with transactions that can be across chains. It is a great technical achievement, but one that has now created a void that needs to be addressed by equally great advancements in User Experience.\\n\\nI recently, in an attempt to support the Celo community and ecosystem, sought out to purchase a Celo Punk - one of the first NFTs on the Celo blockchain. This attempt and  experience magnified the disconnect in the current UX capabilities of some parts of web3 for me. I’ll explain very briefly my observation during this process. (Admittedly, I am in part in fault for the following but nonetheless…)\\n\\n* I was utilizing my Metamask wallet which had ETH in it\\n* I realized that I could not purchase a Celo Punk with ETH\\n* I then utilized Uniswap to swap my ETH for Wrapped Celo\\n* Wrapped Celo was not suitable for purchase so I next swapped more ETH for Celo\\n* I acquired Celo native token, but my MetaMask wallet was not in the Celo Mainnet\\n* I finally set up a Celo wallet which was separate from Metamask\\n* Some more trouble shooting etc. etc.\\n* It was a time consuming and far from seamless process\\n\\nThe point being, the UX was not seamless - and this is not in anyway related to Metamask, Ethereum or Celo - I very much enjoy these products, but without a cleaner UX it will be nearly impossible for a first time crypto user to navigate many of the current channels.\\n\\nThis is why I believe this is UX’s moment to take web3 forward and develop a revolutionary user interface that will allow the ecosystem to move in step, in the context of enabling mainstream adoption, with the technical advances we’ve seen in scaling and cross chain compatibility. It is with great excitement that Peatix is taking part and dedicating the resources to developing these new UI/UX advancements, and that companies like Kickstarter and protocols like Celo see this vision that enabling seamless integration will be a powerful force in web3’s future.\",\"timestamp\":1641482727,\"title\":\"navigating web3, the importance of the UX... \"},\"digest\":\"cYZnnCty-qB_24OxU6UebYF1oP7irsEzAogUMtyRdRM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf658FFF8f2D1805d07f28e1ae6F0b6a82928a7f9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iprU8lOCMjTVm4vLQwEehRiBPaovc4W7ixaCsKH_JKM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rOmauyp9YYt8XeSJUijeEH9KXvWUNe3y8XVYZCkl7YM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"2ZWu0CMH_GXT-6QQDWpo5nV1aCb2i_JbELxcbOhJJ2IZVTnTs9NnZUX1Cv3nLDlhRoXFytRhaiAQ734nLnC8hA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb918b9a08e1476f52351750df5bed6bfa4271d6ca718c303ab004c26aaebf94932e18b848eefb3a08bde8dd9f45b57059ce528848ce7d2406bce6533cd62310d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iprU8lOCMjTVm4vLQwEehRiBPaovc4W7ixaCsKH_JKM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rOmauyp9YYt8XeSJUijeEH9KXvWUNe3y8XVYZCkl7YM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lSvrK92M_dUWF9XNYevOGZqtz3iHhiuV1OdfjXbBa2w\"}"
