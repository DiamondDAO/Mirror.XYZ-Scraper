"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"to be every day subduing his passions and laying aside his prejudices.'  We are not philosophers, but we shall be enrolled in the foremost ranks of philosophy if we imitate such philosophers in their daily work, as we must do and shall do. Well, are we begun to do it?  Are we engaged in that work of theirs and ours every day?  Is God our witness and our judge that we are? Are we so engaged upon that inward work, and so succeeding in it, that we can read our most prejudiced newspaper with the same mind and spirit, with the same profit and progress, with which we read our Bible?  A good man, a humble man, a man acutely sensible of his ill-conditions, will look on every day as lost or won according as he has lost or won in this inward war.  If his partialities are dropping off his mind; if his prejudices are melting; if he can read books and papers with pleasure and instruction that once filled him with dark passions and angry outbursts; if his Calvinism lets him read Thomas A Kempis and Jeremy Taylor and William Law; if his High-Churchism lets him delight to worship God in an Independent or a Presbyterian church; if his Free-Churchism permits him to see the Establishment reviving, and his State-Churchism admits that the Free Churches have more to say to him than he had at one time thought; if his Toryism lets him take in a Radical paper, and his Radicalism a Unionist paper--then let him thank God, for God is in all that though he knew it not.  And when he counts up his incalculable benefits at each return of the Lord's table, let him count up as not the least of them an open mind and a well- conditioned heart, an unprejudiced mind, and an impartial heart.\\n\\n1. And now, to conclude:  Take old, angry, ill-conditioned Prejudice, his daily prayer:  'My Adorable God and Creator!  Thy Holy Church is by the wickedness of men divided into various communions, all hating, condemning, and endeavouring to destroy one another.  I made none of these divisions, nor am I any longer a defender of them.  I wish everything removed out of every communion that hinders the Common Unity.  The wranglings and disputings of whole churches and nations have so confounded all things that I have no ability to make a true and just judgment of the matters between them.  If I knew that any one of these communions was alone acceptable to Thee, I would do or suffer anything to make myself a member of it.  For, my Good God, I desire nothing so much as to know and to love Thee, and to worship Thee in the most acceptable manner.  And as I humbly presume that Thou wouldst not suffer Thy Church to be thus universally divided, if no divided portion could offer any worship acceptable unto Thee; and as I have no knowledge of what is absolutely best in these divided parts, nor any ability to put an end to them; so I fully trust in Thy goodness, that Thou wilt not suffer these divisions to separate me from Thy mercy in Christ Jesus; and that, if there be any better ways of serving Thee than those I already enjoy, Thou wilt, according to Thine infinite mercy, lead me into them, O God of my peace and my love.'  After this manner old, angry, ill-conditioned Prejudice prayed every day till he died, a little child, in charity with all men, and in acceptance with Almighty God.\\n\\nCHAPTER IX--CAPTAIN ANYTHING\\n\\n'I am made all things to all men . . . I please all men in all things.'--Paul\\n\\nCaptain Anything came originally from the ancient town of Fair- speech.\\n\\nFair-speech had many royal bounties and many special privileges bestowed upon it, and Captain Anything and his family had come to many titles and to great riches in that ancient, loyal, and honourable borough.  My Lord Turn-about, my Lord Time-server, my Lord Fair-speech (from whose ancestors that town first took its name), as also such well-known commoners as Mr. Smooth-man, Mr. Facing-both-ways, and Mr. Two-tongues were all sprung with Captain Anything from the same ancient and long-established ancestry.  As to his religion, from a child young Anything had sat under the parson of the parish, the same Reverend Two-tongues as has been mentioned above.  And our budding soldier followed the example of his minister in that he never strove too long against wind or tide, or was ever to be seen on the same side of the street with Religion when she was banished from court or had lost her silver slippers. The crest of the Anythings was a delicately poised weather-cock; and the motto engraved around the gyrating bird ran thus:  'Our judgment always jumps according to the occasion.'  As a military man, Captain Anything is described in military books as a proper man, and a man of courage and skill--to appearance.  He and his company under him were a sort of Swiss guard in Mansoul.  They held themselves open and ready for any master.  They lived not so much by religion or by loyalty as by the fates of worldly fortune.  In his secret despatches Diabolus was wont to address Captain Anything as My Darling; and be sure you recruit your Switzers well, Diabolus would say; but when the real stress of the war came, even Diabolus cast Captain Anything off.  And thus it came about that when both sides were against this despised creature he had to throw down his arms and flee into a safe skulking place for his life. \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* Spell checked to here--85 \\\\*\\\\*\\\\* 1.  In that half-papist, half-atheistic country called France there is a class of politicians known by the name of Opportunists.  They are a kind of public men that, we are thankful to say, are not known in Protestant and Evangelical England, but they may be pictured out and described to you in this homely way:  An Opportunist stands well out of the sparks of the fire, and well in behind the stone wall, till the fanatics for liberty, equality, and fraternity have snatched the chestnuts out of the fire, and then the Opportunist steps out from his safe place and blandly divides the well-roasted tid-bits among his family and his friends.  As long as there is any jeopardy, the Jacobins are denounced and held up to opprobrium; but when the jeopardy and the risk are well past, the sober-minded, cautious, conservative, and responsible statesmen walk off with the portfolios of place and privilege and pay under their honest arms.  But these are the unprincipled papists and infidels of a mushroom republic; and, thank God, such spurious patriotism, and such sham and selfish statesmanship, have not yet shown their miserable heads among faithful, fearless, straightforward, and uncalculating Englishmen.  At the same time, if ever that continental vice should attack our national character, we have two well-known essays in our ethical and casuistical literature that may with perfect safety be pitted against anything that either France or Italy has produced.  Even if they are but a master's irony, let all ambitious men keep Of Cunning and Of Wisdom for a Man's Self under their pillow.  Let all young men who would toady a great man; let all young ministers who would tune their pulpit to king, or court, or society; let all tradesmen and merchants who prefer their profits to their principles--if they have literature enough, let them soak their honest minds in our great Chancellor's sage counsels; and he who promoted Anything and dubbed him his Darling, he will, no doubt, publish both a post and a title on his birthday for you also.\\n\\n1. 'What religion is he of?' asks Dean Swift.  'He is an Anythingarian,' is the answer, 'for he makes his self-interest the sole standard of his life and doctrine.'  And Archbishop Leighton, a very different churchman from the bitter author of the Polite Conversations, is equally contemptuous toward the self-seeker in divine things.  'Your boasted peaceableness often proceeds from a superficial temper; and, not seldom, from a supercilious disdain of whatever has no marketable use or value, and from your utter indifference to true religion.  Toleration is an herb of spontaneous growth in the soil of indifference.  Much of our union of minds proceeds from want of knowledge and from want of affection to religion.  Many who boast of their church conformity, and that no one hears of their noise, may thank the ignorance of their minds for that kind of quietness.'  But by far the most powerful assault that ever was made upon lukewarmness in religion and upon self- seeking in the Church was delivered by Dante in the tremendous third canto of his Inferno:-\\n\\nVarious tongues, Horrible languages, outcries of woe, Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse, With hands together smote that swelled the sounds, Made up a tumult that for ever whirls Round through that air with solid darkness stain'd, Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies. I then, with error yet encompass'd, cried, 'O master!  What is this I hear?  What race Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?' He then to me:  'This miserable fate Suffer the wretched souls of those who lived Without or praise or blame, with that ill band Of angels mixed, who nor rebellious proved, Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves Were only.  Mercy and Justice scorn them both. Speak not of them, but look and pass them by.' Forthwith, I understood for certain this the tribe Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing And to His foes.  Those wretches who ne'er lived, Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung By wasps and hornets, which bedewed their cheeks With blood, that mix'd with tears dropp'd to their feet, And by disgustful worms was gathered there.\\n\\n1. Now, we must all lay it continually and with uttermost humiliation to heart that we all have Captain Anything's opportunism, his self-interest, his insincerity, his instability, and his secret deceitfulness in ourselves.  That man knows little of himself who does not despise and hate himself for his secret self-seeking even in the service of God.  For, how the love of praise will seduce and corrupt this man, and the love of gain that man!  How easy it is to flatter and adulate this man out of all his former opinions and his deepest principles, and how an expected advantage will make that other man forget now an old alliance and now a deep antipathy!  How often the side we take even in the most momentous matters is decided by the most unworthy motives and the most contemptible considerations!  Unstable as water, Reuben shall not excel.  Double-minded men, we, like Jacob's first-born, are unstable in all our ways.  We have no anchor, or, what anchor we sometimes have soon slips.  We have no fixed pole-star by which to steer our life.  Any will-o'-the-wisp of pleasure, or advantage, or praise will run us on the rocks.  The searchers of Mansoul, after long search, at last lighted on Anything, and soon made an end of him.  Seek him out in your own soul also.  Be you sure he is somewhere there.  He is skulking somewhere there.  And, having found him, if you cannot on the spot make an end of him, keep your eye on him, and never say that you are safe from him and his company as long as you are in this soul-deceiving life.  And, that Anything will not be let enter the gates of the city you are set on seeking, that will go largely to make that sweet and clean and truthful city your very heaven to you.\\n2. 'I am made all things to all men, and I please all men in all things.'  One would almost think that was Captain Anything himself, in a frank, cynical, and self-censorious moment.  But if you will look it up you will see that it was a very different man.  The words are the words of Anything, but the heart behind the words is the heart of Paul.  And this, again, teaches us that we should be like the Messiah in this also, not to judge after the sight of our eyes, nor to reprove after the hearing of our ears.  Miserable Anything! outcast alike of heaven and hell!  But, O noble and blessed Apostle! the man, says Thomas Goodwin, who shall be found seated next to Jesus Christ Himself in the kingdom of God.  Happy Paul:  happy even on this earth, since he could say, and in the measure he could say with truth and with sincerity, such self- revelations as these:  'Unto the Jews I am become as a Jew that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law.  To them that are without law, as without law, that I might gain them that are without law.  To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak; I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some.  Giving none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God.  Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.'  Noble words, and inspiring to read.  Yes: but look within, and think what Paul must have passed through; think what he must have been put through before he,--a man of like selfish passions as we are, a man of like selfish passions as Anything was,--could say all that.  Let his crosses and his thorns; his raptures up to the third heaven, and his body of death that he bore about with him all his days; let his magnificent spiritual gifts, and his still more magnificent spiritual graces tell how they all worked together to make the chief of sinners out of the blameless Pharisee, and, at the same time, Christ's own chosen vessel and the apostle of all the churches.  Boasting about his patron apostle, St. Augustine says:  'Far be it from so great an apostle, a vessel elect of God, an organ of the Holy Ghost, to be one man when he preached and another when he wrote; one man in private and another in public.  He was made all things to all men, not by the craft of a deceiver, but from the affection of a sympathiser, succouring the diverse diseases of souls with the diverse emotions of compassion; to the little ones dispensing the lesser doctrines, not false ones, but the higher mysteries to the perfect--all of them, however, true, harmonious, and divine.'  The exquisite irony of Socrates comes into my mind in this connection, and will not be kept out of my mind.  By instinct as well as by art Socrates mixed up the profoundest seriousness with the humorous affectation of qualities of mind and even of character the exact opposite of what all who loved him knew to be the real Socrates. 'Intellectually,' says Dr. Thomson, 'the acutest man of his age, Socrates represents himself in all companies as the dullest person present.  Morally the purest, he affects to be the slave of passion and borrows the language even of the lewd to describe a love and a goodwill far too exalted for the comprehension of his contemporaries.  This irony of his disarmed ridicule by anticipating it; it allayed jealousy and propitiated envy; and it possibly procured him admission into gay circles from which a more solemn teacher would have been excluded.  But all the time it had for its basis a real greatness of soul, a hearty and an unaffected disregard of public opinion, a perfect disinterestedness, and an entire abnegation of self.  He made himself a fool in order that fools by his folly might be made wise; he humbled himself to the level of those among whom his work lay that he might raise some few among them to his own level; he was all things to all men, if by any means he might save some.  Till Alcibiades ends the splendid eloge that Plato puts into his mouth with these words, \\\"All my master's vice and stupidity and worship of wealthy and great men is counterfeit.  It is all but the Silenus-mask which conceals the features of the god within; for if you remove the covering, how shall I describe to you, my friends and boon companions, the excellence of the beauty you will find within!  Whether any of you have seen Socrates in his serious mood, when he has thrown aside the mask and disclosed the divine features beneath it, is more than I know.  But I have seen them, and I can tell you that they seemed to me glorious and marvellous, and, truly, godlike in their beauty.\\\"'\\n\\nWell, now, I gather out of all that this great lesson:  that it is, to begin with, a mere matter of temperament, or what William Law would call a mere matter of complexion and sensibility, whether, to begin with, a man is hard, and dry, and narrow, and stiff, and proud, and scornful, and cruel; or again, whether he is soft and tender, broad and open, and full of sympathy and of the milk of human kindness.  At first, and to begin with, there is neither praise nor blame as yet in the matter.  A man is hard just as a stone is hard; it is his nature.  Or he is soft as clay is soft; it is again his nature.  But, inheriting such a nature, and his inherited nature beginning to appear, then is the time when the true man really begins to be made.  The bad man dwells in contentment, and, indeed, by preference, at home in his own hard, proud, scornful, resentful heart; or, again, in his facile, fawning, tide-waiting, time-serving heart; and thus he chooses, accepts, and prefers his evil fate, and never seeks the help either of God or man to enable him to rise above it.  Paul was not, when we meet him first, the sweet, humble, affable, placable, makeable man that he made himself and came to be after a lifetime of gospel- preaching and of adorning the gospel he preached.  And all the assistances and all the opportunities that came to Paul are still coming to you and to me; till, whether naturally pliable and affectionate or the opposite, we at last shall come to the temperament, the complexion, and the exquisite sensibility of Paul himself.  Are you, then, a hard, stiff, severe, censorious, proud, angry, scornful man?  Or are you a too-easy, too-facile man-pleaser and self-seeker, being all things to all men that you may make use of all men?  Are you?  Then say so.  Confess it to be so.  Admit that you have found yourself out.  And reflect every day what you have got to do in life.  Consider what a new birth you need and must have.  Number your days that are left you in which to make you a new heart, and a new nature, and a new character.  Consider well how you are to set about that divine work.  You have a minister, and your minister is called a divine because by courtesy he is supposed to understand that divine work, and to be engaged on it night and day in himself, and in season and out of season among his people.  He will tell you how you are to make you a new heart.  Or, if he does not and cannot do that; if he preaches about everything but that to a people who will listen to anything but that, then your soul is not in his hands but in your own.  You may not be able to choose your minister, but you can choose what books you are to buy, or borrow, and read.  And if there is not a minister within a hundred miles of you who knows his right hand from his left, then there are surely some booksellers who will advise you about the classical books of the soul till you can order them for yourselves. And thus, if it is your curse and your shame to be as spongy, and soapy, and oily, and slippery as Anything himself; if you choose your church and your reading with any originality, sense, and insight, you need not fear but that you will be let live till you die an honest, upright, honourable, fearless gentleman:  no timid friend to unfashionable truth, as you are to-night, but a man like Thomas Boston's Ettrick elder, who lies waiting the last trump under a gravestone engraven with this legend:  Here lies a man who had a brow for every good cause.  Only, if you would have that written and read on your headstone, you have no time to lose.  If I were you I would not sit another Sabbath under a minister whose preaching was not changing my nature, making my heart new, and transforming my character; no, not though the Queen herself sat in the same loft.  And I would leave the church even of my fathers, and become anything as far as churches go, if I could get a minister who held my face close and ever closer up to my own heart. Nor would I spend a shilling or an hour that I could help on any impertinent book,--any book that did not powerfully help me in the one remaining interest of my one remaining life:  a new nature and a new heart.  No, not I.  No, not I any more.\\n\\nCHAPTER X--CLIP-PROMISE\\n\\n' . . . the promise made of none effect.'--Paul\\n\\nToward the end of the thirteenth century Edward the First, the English Justinian, brought a select colony of artists from Italy to England and gave them a commission to execute their best coinage for the English Mint.  Deft and skilful as those artists were, the work they turned out was but rude and clumsy compared with some of the gold and silver and copper coins of our day.  The Florentine artists took a sheet of gold or of silver and divided the sheet up with great scissors, and then they hammered the cut-out pieces as only a Florentine hammerman could hammer them.  But, working with such tools, and working on such methods, those goldsmiths and silversmiths, with all their art, found it impossible to give an absolutely equal weight and worth to every piece of money that they turned out.  For one thing, their cut and hammered coins had no carved rims round their edges as all our gold and silver and even copper coinage now has.  And, accordingly, the clever rogues of that day soon discovered that it was far easier for them to take up a pair of shears and to clip a sliver of silver off the rough rim of a shilling, or a shaving of gold off a sovereign, than it was to take of their coats and work a hard day's work.  Till to clip the coin of the realm soon became one of the easiest and most profitable kinds of crime.  In the time of Elizabeth a great improvement was made in the way of coining the public money; but it was soon found that this had only made matters worse.  For now, side by side with a pure and unimpaired and full-valued currency, and mingled up everywhere with it, there was the old, clipped, debased, and far too light gold and silver money; till troubles arose in connection with the coinage and circulation of the country that can only be told by Macaulay's extraordinarily graphic pen. 'It may well be doubted,' Macaulay says, in the twenty-first chapter of his History of England, 'whether all the misery which has been inflicted on the English nation in a quarter of a century by bad Kings, bad Ministers, bad Parliaments, and bad Judges was equal to the misery caused in a single year by bad crowns and bad shillings.  Whether Whigs or Tories, Protestants or Papists were uppermost, the grazier drove his beasts to market, the grocer weighed out his currants, the draper measured out his broadcloth, the hum of buyers and sellers was as loud as ever in the towns; the cream overflowed the pails of Cheshire; the apple juice foamed in the presses of Herefordshire; the piles of crockery glowed in the furnaces of the Trent, and the barrows of coal rolled fast along the timber railways of the Tyne.  But when the great instrument of exchange became thoroughly deranged all trade and all industry were smitten as with a palsy.  Nothing could be purchased without a dispute.  Over every counter there was wrangling from morning to night.  The employer and his workmen had a quarrel as regularly as Saturday night came round.  On a fair day or a market day the clamours, the disputes, the reproaches, the taunts, the curses, were incessant.  No merchant would contract to deliver goods without making some stipulation about the quality of the coin in which he was to be paid.  The price of the necessaries of life, of shoes, of ale, of oatmeal, rose fast.  The bit of metal called a shilling the labourer found would not go so far as sixpence.  One day Tonson sends forty brass shillings to Dryden, to say nothing of clipped money.  The great poet sends them all back and demands in their place good guineas.  \\\"I expect,\\\" he says, \\\"good silver, not such as I had formerly.\\\"  Meanwhile, at every session of the Old Bailey the most terrible example of coiners and clippers was made. Hurdles, with four, five, six wretches convicted of counterfeiting or mutilating the money of the realm, were dragged month after month up Holborn Hill.'  But I cannot copy the whole chapter, wonderful as the writing is.  Suffice it to say that before the clippers could be rooted out, and confidence restored between buyer and seller, the greatest statesmen, the greatest financiers, and the greatest philosophers were all at their wits' end.  Kings' speeches, cabinet councils, bills of Parliament, and showers of pamphlets were all full in those days of the clipper and the coiner.  All John Locke's great intellect came short of grappling successfully with the terrible crisis the clipper of the coin had brought upon England.  Carry all that, then, over into the life of personal religion, after the manner of our Lord's parables, and after the manner of the Pilgrim's Progress and the Holy War, and you will see what an able and impressive use John Bunyan will make of the shears of the coin-clippers of his day.  Macaulay has but made us ready to open and understand Bunyan.  'After this, my Lord apprehended Clip-Promise.  Now, because he was a notorious villain, for by his doings much of the king's coin was abused, therefore he was made a public example.  He was arraigned and judged to be set first in the pillory, then to be whipped by all the children and servants in Mansoul, and then to be hanged till he was dead.  Some may wonder at the severity of this man's punishment, but those that are honest traders in Mansoul they are sensible of the great abuse that one clipper of promises in little time may do in the town of Mansoul; and, truly, my judgment is that all those of his name and life should be served out even as he.'\\n\\nThe grace of God is like a bullion mass of purest gold, and then Jesus Christ is the great ingot of that gold, and then Moses, and David, and Isaiah, and Hosea, and Paul, and Peter, and John are the inspired artists who have commission to take both bullion and ingot, and out of them to cut, and beat, and smelt, and shape, and stamp, and superscribe the promises, and then to issue the promises to pass current in the market of salvation like so many shekels, and pounds, and pence, and farthings, and mites, as the case may be.  And it was just these royal coins, imaged and superscribed so richly and so beautifully, that Clip-Promise so mutilated, abused, and debased, till for doing so he was hanged by the neck till he was dead.\\n\\n1. The very house of Israel herself, the very Mint-house, Tower Hill, and Lombard Street of Israel herself, was full of false coiners and clippers of the promises; as full as ever England was at her very worst.  Israel clipped her Messianic promises and lived upon the clippings instead of upon the coin.  Her coming Christ, and His salvation already begun, were the true spiritual currency of Old Testament times; while round that central Image of her great promise there ran an outside rim of lesser promises that all took their true and their only value from Him whose image and superscription stood within.  But those besotted and infatuated men of Israel, instead of entering into and living by the great spiritual promises given to them in their Messiah, made lands, and houses, and meat, and drink, all the Messiah they cared for. Matthew Henry says that when we go to the merchant to buy goods, he gives us the paper and the pack-thread to the bargain.  Well, those children and fools in Israel actually threw away the goods and hoarded and boasted over the paper and the pack-thread.  Our old Scottish lawyers have made us familiar with the distinction in the church between spiritualia and temporalia.  Well, the Jews let the spiritualia go to those who cared to take such things, while they held fast to the temporalia.  And all that went on till His disciples had the effrontery to clip and coin under our Lord's very eyes, and even to ask Him to hold the coin while they sharpened their shears.  'O faithless and perverse generation!  How long shall I be with you?  How long shall I suffer you?  Have I been so long with you, and yet hast thou not known Me, Philip?  O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! And beginning at Moses and all the prophets He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.'\\n2. But those who live in glass houses must take care not to throw stones.  And thus the greatest fool in Israel is safe from you and me.  For, like them, and just as if we had never read one word about them, we bend our hearts and our children's hearts to things seen and temporal, and then, after things seen and temporal have all cast us off, we begin to ask if there is any solace or sweetness for a cast-off heart in things unseen and eternal.  There are great gaps clipt out of our Bibles that not God Himself can ever print or paste in again.  Look and see if half the Book of Proverbs, for instance, with all its noble promises to a godly youth, is not clipt clean out of your dismembered Bible.  That fine leaf also, 'My son, give Me thine heart,' is clean gone out of the twenty-third chapter of the Proverbs years and years ago.  As is the best part of the noble Book of Daniel, and almost the whole of Second Timothy.  'Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness, and meat and drink, and wife and child shall be added unto you.'  Your suicidal shears have cut that golden promise for ever out of your Sermon on the Mount.  So much so that if any or all of these temporal mercies ever come to you, they will come of pure and undeserved mercy, for the time has long passed when you could plead any promise for them.  Still, there are two most excellent uses left to which you can even yet put your mangled and dismembered Bible.  You can make a splendid use of its gaps and of its gashes, and of those waste places where great promises at one time stood.  You can make a grand use even of those gaps if you will descend into them and draw out of them humiliation and repentance, compunction, contrition, and resignation.  And this use also:  When you are moved to take some man who is still young into your confidence, ask him to let you see his Bible and then let him see yours, and point out to him the rents and wounds and wilderness places in yours.  And thus, by these two uses of a clipped-up and half-empty Bible, you may make gains that shall yet set you above those whose Bibles of promises are still as fresh as when they came from God's own hand.  And Samson said, I will now put forth a riddle unto you:  Out of the eater came forth meat, and out of the strong came forth sweetness.\\n3. 'Go out,' said the Lord of Mansoul, 'and apprehend Clip-Promise and bring him before me.'  And they did so.  'Go down to Edinburgh to-night, and go to the door of such and such a church, and, as he comes out arrest Clip-the-Commandments, for he has heard My word all this day again but will not do it.'  Where would you be by midnight if God rose up in anger and swore at this moment that your disobedient time should be no longer?  You would be speechless before such a charge, for the shears are in your pocket at this moment with which you have clipped to pieces this Sabbath-day: shears red with the blood of the Fourth Commandment.  For, when did you rise off your bed this resurrection morning?  And what did you do when you did rise?  What has your reading and your conversation been this whole Lord's day?  How full your heart would have been of faith and love and holiness by this time of night had you not despised the Lord of the Sabbath, and cast all His commandments and opportunities to you behind your back?  What private exercise have you had all day with your Father who sees in secret?  How often have you been on your knees, and where, and how long, and for what, and for whom?  What work of mercy have you done to-day, or determined to do to-morrow?  And so with all the divine commandments:  Mosaic and Christian, legal and evangelical.  Such as:  A tenth of all I have given to thee; a covenant with a wandering eye; a mouth once speaking evil, is it now well watched? not one vessel only, but all the vessels of thy body sanctified till every thought and imagination is well under the obedience of Christ.  Lest His anger for all that begin to burn to-night, make your bed with Eli and Samuel in His sanctuary to-night, lest the avenger of the blood of the commandments leap out on you in your sleep!\\n4. The Old Serpent took with him the great shears of hell, and clipped 'Thou shalt surely die' out of the second chapter of Genesis.  And the same enemy of mankind will clip all the terror of the Lord out of your heart to-night again, if he can.  And he will do it in this way, if he can.  He will have some one at the church door ready and waiting for you.  As soon as the blessing is pronounced, some one will take you by the arm and will entertain you with the talk you love, or that you once loved, till you will be ashamed to confess that there is any terror or turning to God in your heart.  No!  Thou shalt not surely die, says the serpent still.  Why, hast thou not trampled Sabbaths and sermons past counting under thy feet?  What commandment, laid on body or soul, hast thou not broken, and thou art still adding drunkenness to thirst, and God doth not know!  'The woman said unto the serpent, We may not eat of it, neither may we touch it, lest we die.  And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die.'\\n5. You must all have heard of Clito, who used to say that he desired no more time for rising and dressing and saying his prayers than about a quarter of an hour.  Well, that was clipping the thing pretty close, wasn't it?  At the same time it must be admitted that a good deal of prayer may be got through in a quarter of an hour if you do not lose any moment of it.  Especially in the first quarter of the day, if you are expeditious enough to begin to pray before you even begin to dress.  And prayer is really a very strange experience.  There are things about prayer that no man has yet fully found out or told to any.  For one thing, once well began it grows upon a man in a most extraordinary and unheard-of way.  This same Clito for instance, some time after we find him at his prayers before his eyes are open; and then he keeps all morning making his bath, his soap, his towels, his brushes, and his clothes all one long artifice of prayer.  And that till there is not a single piece of his dressing-room furniture that is not ready to swear at the last day that its master long before he died had become a man full of secret prayer.  There is a fountain filled with blood! he exclaims, as he throws himself into his bath; and Jeremiah second and twenty-second he uses regularly to repeat to himself half a dozen times a day as he washes the smoke and dust of the city off his hands and face.  And then Revelation third and eighteenth till his toilet is completed.  Nay, this same Clito has come to be such a devotee to that he had at one time been so expeditious with, that I have seen him forget himself on the street and think that his door was shut.  But there is really no use telling you all that about Clito.  For, till you try closet-prayer for yourself, all that God or man can say to you on that subject will be water spilt on the ground.  All we can say is, Try it.  Begin it.  Some desperate day try it.  Stop when you are on the way to the pond and try it.  Stop when you are fastening up the rope and try it.  When the poison is moving in the cup, stop, shut your door first.  Try God first.  See if He is still waiting.  And, always after, when the steel shears of a too early, too crowded, and far too exacting day are clipping you out of all time for prayer, then what should you do?  What do you do when you simply cannot get your proper fresh air and exercise everyday?  Do you not fall back on the plasticity and pliability of nature and take your air and exercise in large parcels?  You take a ride into the country two or three times a week.  Or, two afternoons a week you have ten miles alone if you cannot get a godly friend.  And then two or three times a year, if you can afford it, you climb an Alp or a Grampian every day for a week or a month; and, so gracious and so adaptable is human nature, that, what others get daily, you get weekly, or monthly, or quarterly, or yearly.  And, though a soul is not to be too much presumed upon, Clito came to tell his friends that his soul could on occasion take in prayer and praise enough for a week in a single morning or afternoon, and, almost, for a whole year in a good holiday.  As Christ Himself did when He said:  Come away apart into a desert place and rest a while; for there are so many people coming and going here that we have no time so much as to eat.\\n6. But I see I must clip off my last point with you, which was to tell you what you already know only too well, and that is, what terrible shears a bad conscience is armed with, and what havoc she makes at all ages of a poor sinner's Bible.  But you can spare that head.  You can preach on that text to yourselves far better than all your ministers.  Only, take home with you these two lines I have clipped out of Fraser of Brea for you.  Nothing in man, he says to us, is to be a ground of despair, since the whole ground of all our hope is in Christ alone.  Christ's relation is always to men as they are sinners and not as they are righteous.  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  'Tis with sinners, then, Christ has to do.  Nothing damns but unbelief; and unbelief is just holding back from pressing God with this promise, that Christ came to save sinners.  This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, and it is still to be found standing in the most clipped-up Bible, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI--STIFF MR. LOTH-TO-STOOP\\n\\n'Thy neck is an iron sinew.'--Jehovah to the house of Jacob.\\n\\n'King Zedekiah humbled not himself, but stiffened his neck.'--The Chronicles.\\n\\n'He humbled himself.'--Paul on our Lord.\\n\\nAll John Bunyan's Characters, Situations, and Episodes are collected into this house to-night.  Obstinate and Pliable are here; Passion and Patience; Simple, Sloth, and Presumption; Madame Bubble and Mr. Worldly-wiseman; Talkative and By-ends; Deaf Mr. Prejudice is here also, and, sitting close beside him, stiff Mr. Loth-to-stoop; while good old Mr. Wet-eyes and young Captain Self- denial are not wholly wanting.  It gives this house an immense and an ever-green interest to me to see character after character coming trooping in, Sabbath evening after Sabbath evening, each man to see himself and his neighbour in John Bunyan's so truthful and so fearless glass.  But it stabs me to the heart with a mortal stab to see how few of us out of this weekly congregation are any better men after all we come to see and to hear.  At the same time, such a constant dropping will surely in time wear away the hardest rock. Let that so stiff old man, then, stiff old Mr. Loth-to-stoop, came forward and behold his natural face in John Bunyan's glass again to-night.  'Lord, is it I?' was a very good question, though put by a very bad man.  Let us, one and all, then, put the traitor's question to ourselves to-night.  Am I stiff old Loth-to-stoop?--let every man in this house say to himself all through this service, and then at home when reviewing the day, and then all to-morrow when to stoop will be so loathsome and so impossible to us all.\\n\\n1. To begin, then, at the very bottom of this whole matter, take stiff old Loth-to-stoop as a guilty sinner in the sight of God. Let us take this stiff old man in this dreadful character to begin with, because it is in this deepest and most dreadful aspect of his nature and his character that he is introduced to us in the Holy War.  And I shall stand aside and let John Bunyan himself describe Loth-to-stoop in the matter of his justification before God.  'That is a great stoop for a sinner to have to take,' says our apostolic author in another classical place, 'a too great stoop to have to suffer the total loss of all his own righteousness, and, actually, to have to look to another for absolutely everything of that kind. That is no easy matter for any man to do.  I assure you it stretches every vein in his heart before he will be brought to yield to that.  What! for a man to deny, reject, abhor, and throw away all his prayers, tears, alms, keeping of Sabbaths, hearing, reading, and all the rest, and to admit both himself and them to be abominable and accursed, and to be willing in the very midst of his sins to throw himself wholly upon the righteousness and obedience of another man!  I say to do that in deed and in truth is the biggest piece of the cross, and therefore it is that Paul calls it a suffering.  \\\"I have suffered the loss of all things that I might win Christ, and be found in Him, not having mine own righteousness.\\\"'  That is John Bunyan's characteristic comment on stiff old Loth-to-stoop as a guilty sinner, with the offer of a full forgiveness set before him.\\n2. And then our so truthful and so fertile author goes on to give us Loth-to-stoop as a half-saved sinner; a sinner, that is, trying to make his own terms with God about his full salvation.  Through three most powerful pages we see stiff old Loth-to-stoop engaged in beating down God's unalterable terms of salvation, and in bidding for his full salvation upon his own reduced and easy terms.  It was the tremendous stoop of the Son of God from the throne of God to the cradle and the carpenter's shop; and then, as if that were not enough, it was that other tremendous stoop of His down to the Garden and the Cross,--it was these two so tremendous stoops of Jesus Christ that made stiff old Loth-to-stoop's salvation even possible.  But, with all that, his true salvation was not possible without stoop after stoop of his own; stoop after stoop which, if not so tremendous as those of Christ, were yet tremendous enough, and too tremendous, for him.  Old Loth-to-stoop carries on a long and a bold debate with Emmanuel in order to lessen the stoop that Emmanuel demands of him; and your own life and mine, my brethren, at their deepest and at their closest to our own heart, are really at bottom, like Loth-to-stoop's life, one long roup of salvation, in which God tries to get us up to His terms and in which we try to get Him down to our terms.  His terms are, that we shall sell absolutely all that we have for the salvation of our souls; and our terms are, salvation or no salvation, to keep all that we have and to seek every day for more.  God absolutely demands that we shall stoop to the very dust every day, till we become the poorest, the meanest, the most despicable, and the most hopeless of men; whereas we meet that divine demand with the proud reply--Is Thy servant a dog?  It was with this offended mind that stiff old Loth-to-stoop at last left off from Emmanuel's presence; he would die rather than come down to such degrading terms.  And as Loth-to-stoop went away, Emmanuel looked after him, well remembering the terrible night when He Himself was, not indeed like Loth-to-stoop, nor near like him, but when His own last stoop was so deep that it made Him cry out, Father, save Me from this hour! and again, If it be possible let this so tremendous stoop pass from Me.  For a moment Emmanuel Himself was loth to stoop, but only for a moment.  For He soon rose from off His face in a bath of blood, saying, Not My will, but Thine be done!  When Thomas A Kempis is negotiating with the Loth- to-stoops of his unevangelical day, we hear him saying to them things like this:  'Jesus Christ was despised of men, forsaken of His friends and lovers, and in the midst of slanders.  He was willing, under His Father's will, to suffer and to be despised, and darest thou to complain of any man's usage of thee?  Christ, thy Master, had enemies and back-biters, and dost thou expect to have all men to be thy friends and benefactors?  Whence shall thy patience attain her promised crown if no adversity befall thee? Suffer thou with Jesus Christ, and for His sake, if thou wouldst reign with Him.  Set thyself, therefore, to bear manfully the cross of thy Lord, who, out of love, was crucified for thee.  Know for certain that thou must lead a daily dying life.  And the more that thou diest to thyself all that the more shalt thou live unto God.' With many such words as these did Thomas teach the saints of his day to stoop to their daily cross; a daily cross then, which has now been for long to him and to them an everlasting crown.\",\"timestamp\":1641297870,\"title\":\"'It is the work of a philosopher,' says Addison in one of his best Spectators\"},\"digest\":\"-IaUOnnV2VGsTFCqqBDju4q3HhQZ0YzLhCNvlR1T-mY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9dA14EBFe3CfE059a88A873b83F5D7f596175316\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"25ZMKCV0GixqwiUuK3KY9D7jE1lLZq1aRncNqAIRqPk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DEEmNVxS8WMDjtdOcuAyRs6hsc6cNQ8y6mtq1ByI4ss\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4vBeLOOJUdv9wMPddFNgpFRkuCFh3NomuDYn8nQt-4uyiUa9y37ggVSrVDlsRut7PwDoHPdoGYZ1AJAnzgNSZw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9a482074ae313f658f39f09f8b439252183d07fd9b265724093bffd963eb9d62769aba615ac0fac9eafb24b748488e9c69e8c1c85ea8ad9d5a9f27e5abd485b61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"25ZMKCV0GixqwiUuK3KY9D7jE1lLZq1aRncNqAIRqPk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DEEmNVxS8WMDjtdOcuAyRs6hsc6cNQ8y6mtq1ByI4ss\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-IaUOnnV2VGsTFCqqBDju4q3HhQZ0YzLhCNvlR1T-mY\"}"
