These are our inaugural projects.\\n\\n### The Salt Ruby Affair\\n\\nAn art-heist comedy set on the fictional island of San Gaspare in the 1960’s. Our community draws its name from this exciting project that has been in development for over a year.\\n\\n* **Animatic Storyboard Complete**. A shot-for-shot animation, edited together to provide the production team with a visual reference, shot list, and overall feel for the film before arriving on set.\\n* **Locations Scouted** on the Greek island of Corfu in the glistening Ionian Sea.\\n* **Department Heads** **Identified.** The Director, Cinematographer, and Production Designer are all accounted for, as well as partnered production companies for logistics.\\n* **Lead Actor Cast.** Yet to be revealed.\\n* **Tentative Start Date for Principal Photography**: April 2nd, 2022\\n\\n### Untitled Animated Space Opera Series\\n\\nCommissioned by the SpiceDAO, we have been brought on to create an animated anthology series inspired by the visuals from their recently acquired edition of Alejandro Jodorowsky’s *Dune* Bible.\\n\\n* **Financing Complete.**\\n* **Visual Artists identified.**\\n* **Pre-production coming soon.**\\n\\n### Future Projects\\n\\nOur two initial projects are just the first step. Once they get underway, we will begin the process of collectively deciding on future projects as a DAO. Our movie studio will be a space where **any member can suggest a potential project, any member can turn our attention to a budding filmmaker, and any member can feel responsible for making great art possible.**\\n\\n## Membership\\n\\nCurrently, membership is limited to those who hold a token from our NFT Portrait Collection: ***The Citizens of San Gaspare,*** the proceeds of which will go towards producing *The Salt Ruby Affair*.\\n\\n**Each token counts as a governance vote**, with those who hold more having greater say over our Film Society’s course.\\n\\nTokens are available on our project’s homepage: https://www.sangaspare.io\\n\\n> “The world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains, rivers & cities; but to know someone who thinks & feels with us, & who, though distant, is close to us in spirit, this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden.”\\n\\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe\\n\\nCome join us on a journey into a brighter future for the world of cinema.\\n\\n**Our doors are open to you.**\",\"timestamp\":1639079471,\"title\":\"The Film Society of San Gaspare - A Movie Studio DAO\"},\"digest\":\"ryzbw5BBDu4UVq3ICyuAlmVL66r-ZxQt5DrJrDKxBHk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe3b8f301941a193ea238526b1Ff16B7Daa1691d4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ygP6nabFEuJYSJiI4xoo7dEvTq02Ruod6KR51IAfwxY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NG2ZwuL5nIvM6Ws1WeUHqcwR4xj6UJ2ipQ1n4yYHzuM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AVVOcAz3meQi18jB3dG6QwsQhZG0J0HXEt43QZVmMacWtJy4lkDXA06TFYOtNKZOV9OVhVT1juYQBXuYvwiw-Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcd42027bf25c8978cf45e46a45f896de93bc8609ef0066667696b8553431dbd549b761e1dd7b087871cd3ff3620fb02521a5ff0aa1e23ef883303143fbef3e781c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ygP6nabFEuJYSJiI4xoo7dEvTq02Ruod6KR51IAfwxY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NG2ZwuL5nIvM6Ws1WeUHqcwR4xj6UJ2ipQ1n4yYHzuM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ryzbw5BBDu4UVq3ICyuAlmVL66r-ZxQt5DrJrDKxBHk\"}"
