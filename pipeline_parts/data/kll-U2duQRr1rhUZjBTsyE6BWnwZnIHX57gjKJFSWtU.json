"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Conwell smiles in genial reminiscence and without any apparent sense that he is telling of a great personal triumph, and goes on:\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Those two men both paid the money, and of course the church people themselves, who at first had not quite understood that I could be in earnest, joined in and helped, with work and money, and as, while the new church was building, it was peculiarly important to get and keep the congregation together, and as they had ceased to have a minister of their own, I used to run out from Boston and preach for them, in a room we hired.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`And it was there in Lexington, in 1879, that I determined to become a minister.  I had a good law practice, but I determined to give it up.  For many years I had felt more or less of a call to the ministry, and here at length was the definite time to begin.\\n\\n`Week by week I preached there''--how strange, now, to think of William Dean Howells and the colonel-preacher!--`and after a while the church was completed, and in that very church, there in Lexington, I was ordained a minister.''\\n\\nA marvelous thing, all this, even without considering the marvelous heights that Conwell has since attained--a marvelous thing, an achievement of positive romance!  That little church stood for American bravery and initiative and self-sacrifice and romanticism in a way that well befitted good old Lexington.\\n\\nTo leave a large and overflowing law practice and take up the ministry at a salary of six hundred dollars a year seemed to the relatives of Conwell's wife the extreme of foolishness, and they did not hesitate so to express themselves.  Naturally enough, they did not have Conwell's vision.  Yet he himself was fair enough to realize and to admit that there was a good deal of fairness in their objections; and so he said to the congregation that, although he was quite ready to come for the six hundred dollars a year, he expected them to double his salary as soon as he doubled the church membership.  This seemed to them a good deal like a joke, but they answered in perfect earnestness that they would be quite willing to do the doubling as soon as he did the doubling, and in less than a year the salary was doubled accordingly.\\n\\nI asked him if he had found it hard to give up the lucrative law for a poor ministry, and his reply gave a delightful impression of his capacity for humorous insight into human nature, for he said, with a genial twinkle:\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Oh yes, it was a wrench; but there is a sort of romance of self-sacrifice, you know.  I rather suppose the old-time martyrs rather enjoyed themselves in being martyrs!''\\n\\nConwell did not stay very long in Lexington.  A struggling little church in Philadelphia heard of what he was doing, and so an old deacon went up to see and hear him, and an invitation was given; and as the Lexington church seemed to be prosperously on its feet, and the needs of the Philadelphia body keenly appealed to Conwell's imagination, a change was made, and at a salary of eight hundred dollars a year he went, in 1882, to the little struggling Philadelphia congregation, and of that congregation he is still pastor--only, it ceased to be a struggling congregation a great many years ago!  And long ago it began paying him more thousands every year than at first it gave him hundreds.\\n\\nDreamer as Conwell always is in connection with his immense practicality, and moved as he is by the spiritual influences of life, it is more than likely that not only did Philadelphia's need appeal, but also the fact that Philadelphia, as a city, meant much to him, for, coming North, wounded from a battle-field of the Civil War, it was in Philadelphia that he was cared for until his health and strength were recovered.  Thus it came that Philadelphia had early become dear to him.\\n\\nAnd here is an excellent example of how dreaming great dreams may go hand-in-hand with winning superb results.  For that little struggling congregation now owns and occupies a great new church building that seats more people than any other Protestant church in America--and Dr. Conwell fills it!\\n\\nIII\\n\\nSTORY OF THE FIFTY-SEVEN CENTS\\n\\nAT every point in Conwell's life one sees that he wins through his wonderful personal influence on old and young.  Every step forward, every triumph achieved, comes not alone from his own enthusiasm, but because of his putting that enthusiasm into others.  And when I learned how it came about that the present church buildings were begun, it was another of those marvelous tales of fact that are stranger than any imagination could make them.  And yet the tale was so simple and sweet and sad and unpretending.\\n\\nWhen Dr. Conwell first assumed charge of the little congregation that led him to Philadelphia it was really a little church both in its numbers and in the size of the building that it occupied, but it quickly became so popular under his leadership that the church services and Sunday- school services were alike so crowded that there was no room for all who came, and always there were people turned from the doors.\\n\\nOne afternoon a little girl, who had eagerly wished to go, turned back from the Sunday-school door, crying bitterly because they had told her that there was no more room.  But a tall, black- haired man met her and noticed her tears and, stopping, asked why it was that she was crying, and she sobbingly replied that it was because they could not let her into the Sunday-school.\\n\\n`I lifted her to my shoulder,'' says Dr. Conwell, in telling of this; for after hearing the story elsewhere I asked him to tell it to me himself, for it seemed almost too strange to be true.  `I lifted her to my shoulder''--and one realizes the pretty scene it must have made for the little girl to go through the crowd of people, drying her tears and riding proudly on the shoulders of the kindly, tall, dark man!  \\\\`\\\\`I said to her that I would take her in, and I did so, and I said to her that we should some day have a room big enough for all who should come.  And when she went home she told her parents--I only learned this afterward--that she was going to save money to help build the larger church and Sunday-school that Dr. Conwell wanted!  Her parents pleasantly humored her in the idea and let her run errands and do little tasks to earn pennies, and she began dropping the pennies into her bank.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`She was a lovable little thing--but in only a few weeks after that she was taken suddenly ill and died; and at the funeral her father told me, quietly, of how his little girl had been saving money for a building-fund.  And there, at the funeral, he handed me what she had saved--just fifty- seven cents in pennies.''\\n\\nDr. Conwell does not say how deeply he was moved; he is, after all, a man of very few words as to his own emotions.  But a deep tenderness had crept into his voice.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`At a meeting of the church trustees I told of this gift of fifty-seven cents--the first gift toward the proposed building-fund of the new church that was some time to exist.  For until then the matter had barely been spoken of, as a new church building had been simply a possibility for the future.\\n\\n`The trustees seemed much impressed, and it turned out that they were far more impressed than I could possibly have hoped, for in a few days one of them came to me and said that he thought it would be an excellent idea to buy a lot on Broad Street--the very lot on which the building now stands.''  It was characteristic of Dr. Conwell that he did not point out, what every one who knows him would understand, that it was his own inspiration put into the trustees which resulted in this quick and definite move on the part of one of them.  `I talked the matter over with the owner of the property, and told him of the beginning of the fund, the story of the little girl.  The man was not one of our church, nor in fact, was he a church-goer at all, but he listened attentively to the tale of the fifty-seven cents and simply said he was quite ready to go ahead and sell us that piece of land for ten thousand dollars, taking--and the unexpectedness of this deeply touched me taking a first payment of just fifty-seven cents and letting the entire balance stand on a five-per-cent. mortgage!\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`And it seemed to me that it would be the right thing to accept this unexpectedly liberal proposition, and I went over the entire matter on that basis with the trustees and some of the other members, and all the people were soon talking of having a new church.  But it was not done in that way, after all, for, fine though that way would have been, there was to be one still finer.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Not long after my talk with the man who owned the land, and his surprisingly good-hearted proposition, an exchange was arranged for me one evening with a Mount Holly church, and my wife went with me.  We came back late, and it was cold and wet and miserable, but as we approached our home we saw that it was all lighted from top to bottom, and it was clear that it was full of people.  I said to my wife that they seemed to be having a better time than we had had, and we went in, curious to know what it was all about.  And it turned out that our absence had been intentionally arranged, and that the church people had gathered at our home to meet us on our return.  And I was utterly amazed, for the spokesman told me that the entire ten thousand dollars had been raised and that the land for the church that I wanted was free of debt.  And all had come so quickly and directly from that dear little girl's fifty-seven cents.''\\n\\nDoesn't it seem like a fairy tale!  But then this man has all his life been making fairy tales into realities.  He inspired the child.  He inspired the trustees.  He inspired the owner of the land.  He inspired the people.\\n\\nThe building of the great church--the Temple Baptist Church, as it is termed--was a great undertaking for the congregation; even though it had been swiftly growing from the day of Dr. Conwell's taking charge of it, it was something far ahead of what, except in the eyes of an enthusiast, they could possibly complete and pay for and support.  Nor was it an easy task.\\n\\nGround was broken for the building in 1889, in 1891 it was opened for worship, and then came years of raising money to clear it.  But it was long ago placed completely out of debt, and with only a single large subscription--one of ten thousand dollars--for the church is not in a wealthy neighborhood, nor is the congregation made up of the great and rich.\\n\\nThe church is built of stone, and its interior is a great amphitheater.  Special attention has been given to fresh air and light; there is nothing of the dim, religious light that goes with medieval churchliness.  Behind the pulpit are tiers of seats for the great chorus choir.  There is a large organ.  The building is peculiarly adapted for hearing and seeing, and if it is not, strictly speaking, beautiful in itself, it is beautiful when it is filled with encircling rows of men and women.\\n\\nMan of feeling that he is, and one who appreciates the importance of symbols, Dr. Conwell had a heart of olive-wood built into the front of the pulpit, for the wood was from an olive-tree in the Garden of Gethsemane.  And the amber-colored tiles in the inner walls of the church bear, under the glaze, the names of thousands of his people; for every one, young or old, who helped in the building, even to the giving of a single dollar, has his name inscribed there.  For Dr. Conwell wished to show that it is not only the house of the Lord, but also, in a keenly personal sense, the house of those who built it.\\n\\nThe church has a possible seating capacity of 4,200, although only 3,135 chairs have been put in it, for it has been the desire not to crowd the space needlessly.  There is also a great room for the Sunday-school, and extensive rooms for the young men's association, the young women's association, and for a kitchen, for executive offices, for meeting-places for church officers and boards and committees.  It is a spacious and practical and complete church home, and the people feel at home there.\\n\\n`You see again,'' said Dr. Conwell, musingly, `the advantage of aiming at big things.  That building represents $109,000 above ground.  It is free from debt.  Had we built a small church, it would now be heavily mortgaged.''\\n\\nIV\\n\\nHIS POWER AS ORATOR AND PREACHER\\n\\nEVEN as a young man Conwell won local fame as an orator.  At the outbreak of the Civil War he began making patriotic speeches that gained enlistments.  After going to the front he was sent back home for a time, on furlough, to make more speeches to draw more recruits, for his speeches were so persuasive, so powerful, so full of homely and patriotic feeling, that the men who heard them thronged into the ranks.  And as a preacher he uses persuasion, power, simple and homely eloquence, to draw men to the ranks of Christianity.\\n\\nHe is an orator born, and has developed this inborn power by the hardest of study and thought and practice.  He is one of those rare men who always seize and hold the attention.  When he speaks, men listen.  It is quality, temperament, control--the word is immaterial, but the fact is very material indeed.\\n\\nSome quarter of a century ago Conwell published a little book for students on the study and practice of oratory.  That `clear-cut articulation is the charm of eloquence'' is one of his insisted-upon statements, and it well illustrates the lifelong practice of the man himself, for every word as he talks can be heard in every part of a large building, yet always he speaks without apparent effort.  He avoids `elocution.''  His voice is soft-pitched and never breaks, even now when he is over seventy, because, so he explains it, he always speaks in his natural voice.  There is never a straining after effect.\\n\\n`A speaker must possess a large-hearted regard for the welfare of his audience,'' he writes, and here again we see Conwell explaining Conwellism.  `Enthusiasm invites enthusiasm,'' is another of his points of importance; and one understands that it is by deliberate purpose, and not by chance, that he tries with such tremendous effort to put enthusiasm into his hearers with every sermon and every lecture that he delivers.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`It is easy to raise a laugh, but dangerous, for it is the greatest test of an orator's control of his audience to be able to land them again on the solid earth of sober thinking.''  I have known him at the very end of a sermon have a ripple of laughter sweep freely over the entire congregation, and then in a moment he has every individual under his control, listening soberly to his words.\\n\\nHe never fears to use humor, and it is always very simple and obvious and effective.  With him even a very simple pun may be used, not only with- out taking away from the strength of what he is saying, but with a vivid increase of impressiveness.  And when he says something funny it is in such a delightful and confidential way, with such a genial, quiet, infectious humorousness, that his audience is captivated.  And they never think that he is telling something funny of his own; it seems, such is the skill of the man, that he is just letting them know of something humorous that they are to enjoy with him.\\n\\n`Be absolutely truthful and scrupulously clear,'' he writes; and with delightfully terse common sense, he says, `Use illustrations that illustrate''-- and never did an orator live up to this injunction more than does Conwell himself.  Nothing is more surprising, nothing is more interesting, than the way in which he makes use as illustrations of the impressions and incidents of his long and varied life, and, whatever it is, it has direct and instant bearing on the progress of his discourse.  He will refer to something that he heard a child say in a train yesterday; in a few minutes he will speak of something that he saw or some one whom he met last month, or last year, or ten years ago-- in Ohio, in California, in London, in Paris, in New York, in Bombay; and each memory, each illustration, is a hammer with which he drives home a truth.\\n\\nThe vast number of places he has visited and people he has met, the infinite variety of things his observant eyes have seen, give him his ceaseless flow of illustrations, and his memory and his skill make admirable use of them.  It is seldom that he uses an illustration from what he has read; everything is, characteristically, his own.  Henry M. Stanley, who knew him well, referred to him as `that double-sighted Yankee,'' who could `see at a glance all there is and all there ever was.''\\n\\nAnd never was there a man who so supplements with personal reminiscence the place or the person that has figured in the illustration.  When he illustrates with the story of the discovery of California gold at Sutter's he almost parenthetically remarks, `I delivered this lecture on that very spot a few years ago; that is, in the town that arose on that very spot.''  And when he illustrates by the story of the invention of the sewing-machine, he adds:  `I suppose that if any of you were asked who was the inventor of the sewing-machine, you would say that it was Elias Howe.  But that would be a mistake.  I was with Elias Howe in the Civil War, and he often used to tell me how he had tried for fourteen years to invent the sewing-machine and that then his wife, feeling that something really had to be done, invented it in a couple of hours.''  Listening to him, you begin to feel in touch with everybody and everything, and in a friendly and intimate way.\\n\\nAlways, whether in the pulpit or on the platform, as in private conversation, there is an absolute simplicity about the man and his words; a simplicity, an earnestness, a complete honesty.  And when he sets down, in his book on oratory, \\\\`\\\\`A man has no right to use words carelessly,'' he stands for that respect for word-craftsmanship that every successful speaker or writer must feel.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Be intensely in earnest,'' he writes; and in writing this he sets down a prime principle not only of his oratory, but of his life.\\n\\nA young minister told me that Dr. Conwell once said to him, with deep feeling, \\\\`\\\\`Always remember, as you preach, that you are striving to save at least one soul with every sermon.''  And to one of his close friends Dr. Conwell said, in one of his self-revealing conversations:\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`I feel, whenever I preach, that there is always one person in the congregation to whom, in all probability, I shall never preach again, and therefore I feel that I must exert my utmost power in that last chance.''  And in this, even if this were all, one sees why each of his sermons is so impressive, and why his energy never lags.  Always, with him, is the feeling that he is in the world to do all the good he can possibly do; not a moment, not an opportunity, must be lost.\\n\\nThe moment he rises and steps to the front of his pulpit he has the attention of every one in the building, and this attention he closely holds till he is through.  Yet it is never by a striking effort that attention is gained, except in so far that his utter simplicity is striking.  \\\\`\\\\`I want to preach so simply that you will not think it preaching, but just that you are listening to a friend,'' I remember his saying, one Sunday morning, as he began his sermon; and then he went on just as simply as such homely, kindly, friendly words promised.  And how effectively!\\n\\nHe believes that everything should be so put as to be understood by all, and this belief he applies not only to his preaching, but to the reading of the Bible, whose descriptions he not only visualizes to himself, but makes vividly clear to his hearers; and this often makes for fascination in result.\\n\\nFor example, he is reading the tenth chapter of I Samuel, and begins, \\\\`\\\\` \\\\`Thou shalt meet a company of prophets.' ''\\n\\n`` `Singers,' it should be translated,'' he puts in, lifting his eyes from the page and looking out over his people.  Then he goes on, taking this change as a matter of course, `` \\\\`Thou shalt meet a company of singers coming down from the high place--' ''\\n\\nWhereupon he again interrupts himself, and in an irresistible explanatory aside, which instantly raises the desired picture in the mind of every one, he says:  \\\\`\\\\`That means, from the little old church on the hill, you know.''  And how plain and clear and real and interesting--most of all, interesting--it is from this moment!  Another man would have left it that prophets were coming down from a high place, which would not have seemed at all alive or natural, and here, suddenly, Conwell has flashed his picture of the singers coming down from the little old church on the hill!  There is magic in doing that sort of thing.\\n\\nAnd he goes on, now reading:  \\\\`\\\\` \\\\`Thou shalt meet a company of singers coming down from the little old church on the hill, with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, and they shall sing.' ''\\n\\nMusic is one of Conwell's strongest aids.  He sings himself; sings as if he likes to sing, and often finds himself leading the singing--usually so, indeed, at the prayer-meetings, and often, in effect, at the church services.\\n\\nI remember at one church service that the choir-leader was standing in front of the massed choir ostensibly leading the singing, but that Conwell himself, standing at the rear of the pulpit platform, with his eyes on his hymn-book, silently swaying a little with the music and unconsciously beating time as he swayed, was just as unconsciously the real leader, for it was he whom the congregation were watching and with him that they were keeping time!  He never suspected it; he was merely thinking along with the music; and there was such a look of contagious happiness on his face as made every one in the building similarly happy.  For he possesses a mysterious faculty of imbuing others with his own happiness.\\n\\nNot only singers, but the modern equivalent of psaltery and tabret and cymbals, all have their place in Dr. Conwell's scheme of church service; for there may be a piano, and there may even be a trombone, and there is a great organ to help the voices, and at times there are chiming bells.  His musical taste seems to tend toward the thunderous--or perhaps it is only that he knows there are times when people like to hear the thunderous and are moved by it.\\n\\nAnd how the choir themselves like it!  They occupy a great curving space behind the pulpit, and put their hearts into song.  And as the congregation disperse and the choir filter down, sometimes they are still singing and some of them continue to sing as they go slowly out toward the doors.  They are happy--Conwell himself is happy--all the congregation are happy.  He makes everybody feel happy in coming to church; he makes the church attractive just as Howells was so long ago told that he did in Lexington.\\n\\nAnd there is something more than happiness; there is a sense of ease, of comfort, of general joy, that is quite unmistakable.  There is nothing of stiffness or constraint.  And with it all there is full reverence.  It is no wonder that he is accustomed to fill every seat of the great building.\\n\\nHis gestures are usually very simple.  Now and then, when he works up to emphasis, he strikes one fist in the palm of the other hand.  When he is through you do not remember that he has made any gestures at all, but the sound of his voice remains with you, and the look of his wonderful eyes.  And though he is past the threescore years and ten, he looks out over his people with eyes that still have the veritable look of youth.\\n\\nLike all great men, he not only does big things, but keeps in touch with myriad details.  When his assistant, announcing the funeral of an old member, hesitates about the street and number and says that they can be found in the telephone directory, Dr. Conwell's deep voice breaks quietly in with, \\\\`\\\\`Such a number \\\\[giving it\\\\], Dauphin Street''--quietly, and in a low tone, yet every one in the church hears distinctly every syllable of that low voice.\\n\\nHis fund of personal anecdote, or personal reminiscence, is constant and illustrative in his preaching, just as it is when he lectures, and the reminiscences sweep through many years, and at times are really startling in the vivid and homelike pictures they present of the famous folk of the past that he knew.\\n\\nOne Sunday evening he made an almost casual reference to the time when he first met Garfield, then a candidate for the Presidency.  \\\\`\\\\`I asked Major McKinley, whom I had met in Washington, and whose home was in northern Ohio, as was that of Mr. Garfield, to go with me to Mr. Garfield's home and introduce me.  When we got there, a neighbor had to find him.  \\\\`Jim!  Jim!' he called.  You see, Garfield was just plain Jim to his old neighbors.  It's hard to recognize a hero over your back fence!''  He paused a mo- ment for the appreciative ripple to subside, and went on:\\n\\n`We three talked there together''--what a rare talking that must have been-McKinley, Garfield, and Conwell--`we talked together, and after a while we got to the subject of hymns, and those two great men both told me how deeply they loved the old hymn, `The Old-Time Religion.'  Garfield especially loved it, so he told us, because the good old man who brought him up as a boy and to whom he owed such gratitude, used to sing it at the pasture bars outside of the boy's window every morning, and young Jim knew, whenever he heard that old tune, that it meant it was time for him to get up.  He said that he had heard the best concerts and the finest operas in the world, but had never heard anything he loved as he still loved `The Old-Time Religion.'  I forget what reason there was for McKinley's especially liking it, but he, as did Garfield, liked it immensely.''\\n\\nWhat followed was a striking example of Conwell's intentness on losing no chance to fix an impression on his hearers' minds, and at the same time it was a really astonishing proof of his power to move and sway.  For a new expression came over his face, and he said, as if the idea had only at that moment occurred to him--as it most probably had--`I think it's in our hymnal!''  And in a moment he announced the number, and the great organ struck up, and every person in the great church every man, woman, and child --joined in the swinging rhythm of verse after verse, as if they could never tire, of `The Old- Time Religion.''  It is a simple melody--barely more than a single line of almost monotone music:\\n\\n*It was good enough for mother and it's good enough for me!  It was good on the fiery furnace and it's good enough for me!*\\n\\nThus it went on, with never-wearying iteration, and each time with the refrain, more and more rhythmic and swaying:\\n\\n*The old-time religion,  The old-time religion,  The old-time religion--  It's good enough for me!*\\n\\nThat it was good for the Hebrew children, that it was good for Paul and Silas, that it will help you when you're dying, that it will show the way to heaven--all these and still other lines were sung, with a sort of wailing softness, a curious monotone, a depth of earnestness.  And the man who had worked this miracle of control by evoking out of the past his memory of a meeting with two of the vanished great ones of the earth, stood before his people, leading them, singing with them, his eyes aglow with an inward light.  His magic had suddenly set them into the spirit of the old camp-meeting days, the days of pioneering and hardship, when religion meant so much to everybody, and even those who knew nothing of such things felt them, even if but vaguely.  Every heart was moved and touched, and that old tune will sing in the memory of all who thus heard it and sung it as long as they live.\\n\\nV\\n\\nGIFT FOR INSPIRING OTHERS\\n\\nTHE constant earnestness of Conwell, his desire to let no chance slip by of helping a fellowman, puts often into his voice, when he preaches, a note of eagerness, of anxiety.  But when he prays, when he turns to God, his manner undergoes a subtle and unconscious change.  A load has slipped off his shoulders and has been assumed by a higher power.  Into his bearing, dignified though it was, there comes an unconscious increase of the dignity.  Into his voice, firm as it was before, there comes a deeper note of firmness.  He is apt to fling his arms widespread as he prays, in a fine gesture that he never uses at other times, and he looks upward with the dignity of a man who, talking to a higher being, is proud of being a friend and confidant.  One does not need to be a Christian to appreciate the beauty and fineness of Conwell's prayers.\\n\\nHe is likely at any time to do the unexpected, and he is so great a man and has such control that whatever he does seems to everybody a per- fectly natural thing.  His sincerity is so evident, and whatever he does is done so simply and naturally, that it is just a matter of course.\\n\\nI remember, during one church service, while the singing was going on, that he suddenly rose from his chair and, kneeling beside it, on the open pulpit, with his back to the congregation, remained in that posture for several minutes.  No one thought it strange.  I was likely enough the only one who noticed it.  His people are used to his sincerities.  And this time it was merely that he had a few words to say quietly to God and turned aside for a few moments to say them.\\n\\nHis earnestness of belief in prayer makes him a firm believer in answers to prayer, and, in fact, to what may be termed the direct interposition of Providence.  Doubtless the mystic strain inherited from his mother has also much to do with this.  He has a typically homely way of expressing it by one of his favorite maxims, one that he loves to repeat encouragingly to friends who are in difficulties themselves or who know of the difficulties that are his; and this heartening maxim is, \\\\`\\\\`Trust in God and do the next thing.''\\n\\nAt one time in the early days of his church work in Philadelphia a payment of a thousand dollars was absolutely needed to prevent a law- suit in regard to a debt for the church organ.  In fact, it was worse than a debt; it was a note signed by himself personally, that had become due--he was always ready to assume personal liability for debts of his church--and failure to meet the note would mean a measure of disgrace as well as marked church discouragement.\\n\\nHe had tried all the sources that seemed open to him, but in vain.  He could not openly appeal to the church members, in this case, for it was in the early days of his pastorate, and his zeal for the organ, his desire and determination to have it, as a necessary part of church equipment, had outrun the judgment of some of his best friends, including that of the deacon who had gone to Massachusetts for him.  They had urged a delay till other expenses were met, and he had acted against their advice.\\n\\nHe had tried such friends as he could, and he had tried prayer.  But there was no sign of aid, whether supernatural or natural.\\n\\nAnd then, literally on the very day on which the holder of the note was to begin proceedings against him, a check for precisely the needed one thousand dollars came to him, by mail, from a man in the West--a man who was a total stranger to him.  It turned out that the man's sister, who was one of the Temple membership, had written to her brother of Dr. Conwell's work.  She knew nothing of any special need for money, knew nothing whatever of any note or of the demand for a thousand dollars; she merely outlined to her brother what Dr. Conwell was accomplishing, and with such enthusiasm that the brother at once sent the opportune check.\\n\\nAt a later time the sum of ten thousand dollars was importunately needed.  It was due, payment had been promised.  It was for some of the construction work of the Temple University buildings.  The last day had come, and Conwell and the very few who knew of the emergency were in the depths of gloom.  It was too large a sum to ask the church people to make up, for they were not rich and they had already been giving splendidly, of their slender means, for the church and then for the university.  There was no rich man to turn to; the men famous for enormous charitable gifts have never let themselves be interested in any of the work of Russell Conwell.  It would be unkind and gratuitous to suggest that it has been because their names could not be personally attached, or because the work is of an unpretentious kind among unpretentious people; it need merely be said that neither they nor their agents have cared to aid, except that one of the very richest, whose name is the most distinguished in the entire world as a giver, did once, in response to a strong personal application, give thirty-five hundred dollars, this being the extent of the association of the wealthy with any of the varied Conwell work.\\n\\nSo when it was absolutely necessary to have ten thousand dollars the possibilities of money had been exhausted, whether from congregation or individuals.\\n\\nRussell Conwell, in spite of his superb optimism, is also a man of deep depressions, and this is because of the very fire and fervor of his nature, for always in such a nature there is a balancing.  He believes in success; success must come!--success is in itself almost a religion with him--success for himself and for all the world who will try for it!  But there are times when he is sad and doubtful over some particular possibility.  And he intensely believes in prayer--faith can move mountains; but always he believes that it is better not to wait for the mountains thus to be moved, but to go right out and get to work at moving them.  And once in a while there comes a time when the mountain looms too threatening, even after the bravest efforts and the deepest trust.  Such a time had come--the ten-thousand-dollar debt was a looming mountain that he had tried in vain to move.  He could still pray, and he did, but it was one of the times when he could only think that something had gone wrong.\\n\\nThe dean of the university, who has been closely in touch with all his work for many years, told me of how, in a discouragement which was the more notable through contrast with his usual unfailing courage, he left the executive offices for his home, a couple of blocks away\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`He went away with everything looking dark before him.  It was Christmas-time, but the very fact of its being Christmas only added to his depression--Christmas was such an unnatural time for unhappiness!  But in a few minutes he came flying back, radiant, overjoyed, sparkling with happiness, waving a slip of paper in his hand which was a check for precisely ten thousand dollars!  For he had just drawn it out of an envelope handed to him, as he reached home, by the mail-carrier.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`And it had come so strangely and so naturally!  For the check was from a woman who was profoundly interested in his work, and who had sent the check knowing that in a general way it was needed, but without the least idea that there was any immediate need.  That was eight or nine years ago, but although the donor was told at the time that Dr. Conwell and all of us were most grateful for the gift, it was not until very recently that she was told how opportune it was.  And the change it made in Dr. Conwell!  He is a great man for maxims, and all of us who are associated with him know that one of his favorites is that \\\\`It will all come out right some time!'  And of course we had a rare opportunity to tell him that he ought never to be discouraged.  And it is so seldom that he is!''\\n\\nWhen the big new church was building the members of the church were vaguely disturbed by noticing, when the structure reached the second story, that at that height, on the side toward the vacant and unbought land adjoining, there were several doors built that opened literally into nothing but space!\\n\\nWhen asked about these doors and their purpose, Dr. Conwell would make some casual reply, generally to the effect that they might be excellent as fire-escapes.  To no one, for quite a while, did he broach even a hint of the great plan that was seething in his mind, which was that the buildings of a university were some day to stand on that land immediately adjoining the church!\\n\\nAt that time the university, the Temple University as it is now called, was not even a college, although it was probably called a college.  Conwell had organized it, and it consisted of a number of classes and teachers, meeting in highly inadequate quarters in two little houses.  But the imagination of Conwell early pictured great new buildings with accommodations for thousands!  In time the dream was realized, the imagination became a fact, and now those second-floor doors actually open from the Temple Church into the Temple University!\\n\\nYou see, he always thinks big!  He dreams big dreams and wins big success.  All his life he has talked and preached success, and it is a real and very practical belief with him that it is just as easy to do a large thing as a small one, and, in fact, a little easier!  And so he naturally does not see why one should be satisfied with the small things of life.  `If your rooms are big the people will come and fill them,'' he likes to say.  The same effort that wins a small success would, rightly directed, have won a great success.  `Think big things and then do them!''\\n\\nMost favorite of all maxims with this man of maxims, is `Let Patience have her perfect work.''  Over and over he loves to say it, and his friends laugh about his love for it, and he knows that they do and laughs about it himself.  `I tire them all,'' he says, \\\\`\\\\`for they hear me say it every day.''\\n\\nBut he says it every day because it means so much to him.  It stands, in his mind, as a constant warning against anger or impatience or over-haste --faults to which his impetuous temperament is prone, though few have ever seen him either angry or impatient or hasty, so well does he exercise self-control.  Those who have long known him well have said to me that they have never heard him censure any one; that his forbearance and kindness are wonderful.\\n\\nHe is a sensitive man beneath his composure; he has suffered, and keenly, when he has been unjustly attacked; he feels pain of that sort for a long time, too, for even the passing of years does not entirely deaden it.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`When I have been hurt, or when I have talked with annoying cranks, I have tried to let Patience have her perfect work, for those very people, if you have patience with them, may afterward be of help.''\\n\\nAnd he went on to talk a little of his early years in Philadelphia, and he said, with sadness, that it had pained him to meet with opposition, and that it had even come from ministers of his own denomination, for he had been so misunder- stood and misjudged; but, he added, the momentary somberness lifting, even his bitter enemies had been won over with patience.\\n\\nI could understand a good deal of what he meant, for one of the Baptist ministers of Philadelphia had said to me, with some shame, that at first it used actually to be the case that when Dr. Conwell would enter one of the regular ministers' meetings, all would hold aloof, not a single one stepping forward to meet or greet him.\\n\\n`And it was all through our jealousy of his success,'' said the minister, vehemently.  `He came to this city a stranger, and he won instant popularity, and we couldn't stand it, and so we pounced upon things that he did that were altogether unimportant.  The rest of us were so jealous of his winning throngs that we couldn't see the good in him.  And it hurt Dr. Conwell so much that for ten years he did not come to our conferences.  But all this was changed long ago.  Now no minister is so welcomed as he is, and I don't believe that there ever has been a single time since he started coming again that he hasn't been asked to say something to us.  We got over our jealousy long ago and we all love him.''\\n\\nNor is it only that the clergymen of his own denomination admire him, for not long ago, such having been Dr. Conwell's triumph in the city of his adoption, the rector of the most powerful and aristocratic church in Philadelphia voluntarily paid lofty tribute to his aims and ability, his work and his personal worth.  `He is an inspiration to his brothers in the ministry of Jesus Christ,'' so this Episcopalian rector wrote.  `He is a friend to all that is good, a foe to all that is evil, a strength to the weak, a comforter to the sorrowing, a man of God.  These words come from the heart of one who loves, honors, and reverences him for his character and his deeds.''\\n\\nDr. Conwell did some beautiful and unusual things in his church, instituted some beautiful and unusual customs, and one can see how narrow and hasty criticisms charged him, long ago, with sensationalism--charges long since forgotten except through the hurt still felt by Dr. Conwell himself.  \\\\`\\\\`They used to charge me with making a circus of the church--as if it were possible for me to make a circus of the church!''  And his tone was one of grieved amazement after all these years.\\n\\nBut he was original and he was popular, and therefore there were misunderstanding and jealousy.  His Easter services, for example, years ago, became widely talked of and eagerly anticipated because each sermon would be wrought around some fine symbol; and he would hold in his hand, in the pulpit, the blue robin's egg, or the white dove, or the stem of lilies, or whatever he had chosen as the particular symbol for the particular sermon, and that symbol would give him the central thought for his discourse, accented as it would be by the actual symbol itself in view of the congregation.  The cross lighted by elec- tricity, to shine down over the baptismal pool, the little stream of water cascading gently down the steps of the pool during the baptismal rite, the roses floating in the pool and his gift of one of them to each of the baptized as he or she left the water-- all such things did seem, long ago, so unconventional.  Yet his own people recognized the beauty and poetry of them, and thousands of Bibles in Philadelphia have a baptismal rose from Dr. Conwell pressed within the pages.\\n\\nHis constant individuality of mind, his constant freshness, alertness, brilliancy, warmth, sympathy, endear him to his congregation, and when he returns from an absence they bubble and effervesce over him as if he were some brilliant new preacher just come to them.  He is always new to them.  Were it not that he possesses some remarkable quality of charm he would long ago have become, so to speak, an old story, but instead of that he is to them an always new story, an always entertaining and delightful story, after all these years.\\n\\nIt is not only that they still throng to hear him either preach or lecture, though that itself would be noticeable, but it is the delightful and delighted spirit with which they do it.  Just the other evening I heard him lecture in his own church, just after his return from an absence, and every face beamed happily up at him to welcome him back, and every one listened as intently to his every word as if he had never been heard there before; and when the lecture was over a huge bouquet of flowers was handed up to him, and some one embarrassedly said a few words about its being because he was home again.  It was all as if he had just returned from an absence of months--and he had been away just five and a half days!\\n\\nVI\\n\\nMILLIONS OF HEARERS\\n\\nTHAT Conwell is not primarily a minister-- that he is a minister because he is a sincere Christian, but that he is first of all an Abou Ben Adhem, a man who loves his fellow-men, becomes more and more apparent as the scope of his life- work is recognized.  One almost comes to think that his pastorate of a great church is even a minor matter beside the combined importance of his educational work, his lecture work, his hospital work, his work in general as a helper to those who need help.\\n\\nFor my own part, I should say that he is like some of the old-time prophets, the strong ones who found a great deal to attend to in addition to matters of religion.  The power, the ruggedness, the physical and mental strength, the positive grandeur of the man--all these are like the general conceptions of the big Old Testament prophets.  The suggestion is given only because it has often recurred, and therefore with the feeling that there is something more than fanciful in the com- parison; and yet, after all, the comparison fails in one important particular, for none of the prophets seems to have had a sense of humor!\\n\\nIt is perhaps better and more accurate to describe him as the last of the old school of American philosophers, the last of those sturdy-bodied, high- thinking, achieving men who, in the old days, did their best to set American humanity in the right path--such men as Emerson, Alcott, Gough, Wendell Phillips, Garrison, Bayard Taylor, Beecher; men whom Conwell knew and admired in the long ago, and all of whom have long since passed away.\\n\\nAnd Conwell, in his going up and down the country, inspiring his thousands and thousands, is the survivor of that old-time group who used to travel about, dispensing wit and wisdom and philosophy and courage to the crowded benches of country lyceums, and the chairs of school-houses and town halls, or the larger and more pretentious gathering-places of the cities.\\n\\nConwell himself is amused to remember that he wanted to talk in public from his boyhood, and that very early he began to yield to the inborn impulse.  He laughs as he remembers the variety of country fairs and school commencements and anniversaries and even sewing-circles where he tried his youthful powers, and all for experience alone, in the first few years, except possibly for such a thing as a ham or a jack-knife!  The first money that he ever received for speaking was, so he remembers with glee, seventy-five cents; and even that was not for his talk, but for horse hire!  But at the same time there is more than amusement in recalling these experiences, for he knows that they were invaluable to him as training.  And for over half a century he has affectionately remembered John B. Gough, who, in the height of his own power and success, saw resolution and possibilities in the ardent young hill-man, and actually did him the kindness and the honor of introducing him to an audience in one of the Massachusetts towns; and it was really a great kindness and a great honor, from a man who had won his fame to a young man just beginning an oratorical career.\\n\\nConwell's lecturing has been, considering everything, the most important work of his life, for by it he has come into close touch with so many millions--literally millions!--of people.\\n\\nI asked him once if he had any idea how many he had talked to in the course of his career, and he tried to estimate how many thousands of times he had lectured, and the average attendance for each, but desisted when he saw that it ran into millions of hearers.  What a marvel is such a fact as that!  Millions of hearers!\\n\\nI asked the same question of his private secretary, and found that no one had ever kept any sort of record; but as careful an estimate as could be made gave a conservative result of fully eight million hearers for his lectures; and adding the number to whom he has preached, who have been over five million, there is a total of well over thirteen million who have listened to Russell Conwell's voice!  And this staggering total is, if anything, an underestimate.  The figuring was done cautiously and was based upon such facts as that he now addresses an average of over forty-five hundred at his Sunday services (an average that would be higher were it not that his sermons in vacation time are usually delivered in little churches; when at home, at the Temple, he addresses three meetings every Sunday), and that he lectures throughout the entire course of each year, including six nights a week of lecturing during vacation-time.  What a power is wielded by a man who has held over thirteen million people under the spell of his voice!  Probably no other man who ever lived had such a total of hearers.  And the total is steadily mounting, for he is a man who has never known the meaning of rest.\\n\\nI think it almost certain that Dr. Conwell has never spoken to any one of what, to me, is the finest point of his lecture-work, and that is that he still goes gladly and for small fees to the small towns that are never visited by other men of great reputation.  He knows that it is the little places, the out-of-the-way places, the submerged places, that most need a pleasure and a stimulus, and he still goes out, man of well over seventy that he is, to tiny towns in distant states, heedless of the discomforts of traveling, of the poor little hotels that seldom have visitors, of the oftentimes hopeless cooking and the uncleanliness, of the hardships and the discomforts, of the unventilated and overheated or underheated halls.  He does not think of claiming the relaxation earned by a lifetime of labor, or, if he ever does, the thought of the sword of John Ring restores instantly his fervid earnestness.\\n\\nHow he does it, how he can possibly keep it up, is the greatest marvel of all.  I have before me a list of his engagements for the summer weeks of this year, 1915, and I shall set it down because it will specifically show, far more clearly than general statements, the kind of work he does.  The list is the itinerary of his vacation.  Vacation!  Lecturing every evening but Sunday, and on Sundays preaching in the town where he happens to be!\\n\\nJune 24 Ackley, Ia.

He sincerely believes that to write his life would be, in the main, just to tell what people have done for him.  He knows and admits that he works unweariedly, but in profound sincerity he ascribes the success of his plans to those who have seconded and assisted him.  It is in just this way that he looks upon every phase of his life.  When he is reminded of the devotion of his old soldiers, he remembers it only with a sort of pleased wonder that they gave the devotion to him, and he quite forgets that they loved him because he was always ready to sacrifice ease or risk his own life for them.\\n\\nHe deprecates praise; if any one likes him, the liking need not be shown in words, but in helping along a good work.  That his church has succeeded has been because of the devotion of the people; that the university has succeeded is because of the splendid work of the teachers and pupils; that the hospitals have done so much has been because of the noble services of physicians and nurses.  To him, as he himself expresses it, realizing that success has come to his plans, it seems as if the realities are but dreams.  He is astonished by his own success.  He thinks mainly of his own shortcomings.  `God and man have ever been very patient with me.''  His depression is at times profound when he compares the actual results with what he would like them to be, for always his hopes have gone soaring far in advance of achievement.  It is the `Hitch your chariot to a star'' idea.\\n\\nHis modesty goes hand-in-hand with kindliness, and I have seen him let himself be introduced in his own church to his congregation, when he is going to deliver a lecture there, just because a former pupil of the university was present who, Conwell knew, was ambitious to say something inside of the Temple walls, and this seemed to be the only opportunity.\\n\\nI have noticed, when he travels, that the face of the newsboy brightens as he buys a paper from him, that the porter is all happiness, that conductor and brakeman are devotedly anxious to be of aid.  Everywhere the man wins love.  He loves humanity and humanity responds to the love.\\n\\nHe has always won the affection of those who knew him, and Bayard Taylor was one of the many; he and Bayard Taylor loved each other for long acquaintance and fellow experiences as world- wide travelers, back in the years when comparatively few Americans visited the Nile and the Orient, or even Europe.\\n\\nWhen Taylor died there was a memorial service in Boston at which Conwell was asked to preside, and, as he wished for something more than addresses, he went to Longfellow and asked him to write and read a poem for the occasion.  Longfellow had not thought of writing anything, and he was too ill to be present at the services, but, there always being something contagiously inspiring about Russell Conwell when he wishes something to be done, the poet promised to do what he could.  And he wrote and sent the beautiful lines beginning:\\n\\n*Dead he lay among his books,  The peace of God was in his looks*.\\n\\nMany men of letters, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, were present at the services, and Dr. Conwell induced Oliver Wendell Holmes to read the lines, and they were listened to amid profound silence, to their fine ending.\\n\\nConwell, in spite of his widespread hold on millions of people, has never won fame, recognition, general renown, compared with many men of minor achievements.  This seems like an impossibility.  Yet it is not an impossibility, but a fact.  Great numbers of men of education and culture are entirely ignorant of him and his work in the world--men, these, who deem themselves in touch with world-affairs and with the ones who make and move the world.  It is inexplicable, this, except that never was there a man more devoid of the faculty of self-exploitation, self-advertising, than Russell Conwell.  Nor, in the mere reading of them, do his words appeal with anything like the force of the same words uttered by himself, for always, with his spoken words, is his personality.  Those who have heard Russell Conwell, or have known him personally, recognize the charm of the man and his immense forcefulness; but there are many, and among them those who control publicity through books and newspapers, who, though they ought to be the warmest in their enthusiasm, have never felt drawn to hear him, and, if they know of him at all, think of him as one who pleases in a simple way the commoner folk, forgetting in their pride that every really great man pleases the common ones, and that simplicity and directness are attributes of real greatness.\\n\\nBut Russell Conwell has always won the admiration of the really great, as well as of the humbler millions.  It is only a supposedly cultured class in between that is not thoroughly acquainted with what he has done.\\n\\nPerhaps, too, this is owing to his having cast in his lot with the city, of all cities, which, consciously or unconsciously, looks most closely to family and place of residence as criterions of merit--a city with which it is almost impossible for a stranger to become affiliated--or aphiladelphiated, as it might be expressed--and Philadelphia, in spite of all that Dr. Conwell has done, has been under the thrall of the fact that he went north of Market Street--that fatal fact understood by all who know Philadelphia--and that he made no effort to make friends in Rittenhouse Square.  Such considerations seem absurd in this twentieth century, but in Philadelphia they are still potent.  Tens of thousands of Philadelphians love him, and he is honored by its greatest men, but there is a class of the pseudo- cultured who do not know him or appreciate him.  And it needs also to be understood that, outside of his own beloved Temple, he would prefer to go to a little church or a little hall and to speak to the forgotten people, in the hope of encouraging and inspiring them and filling them with hopeful glow, rather than to speak to the rich and comfortable.\\n\\nHis dearest hope, so one of the few who are close to him told me, is that no one shall come into his life without being benefited.  He does not say this publicly, nor does he for a moment believe that such a hope could be fully realized, but it is very dear to his heart; and no man spurred by such a hope, and thus bending all his thoughts toward the poor, the hard-working, the unsuccessful, is in a way to win honor from the Scribes; for we have Scribes now quite as much as when they were classed with Pharisees.  It is not the first time in the world's history that Scribes have failed to give their recognition to one whose work was not among the great and wealthy.\\n\\nThat Conwell himself has seldom taken any part whatever in politics except as a good citizen standing for good government; that, as he expresses it, he never held any political office except that he was once on a school committee, and also that he does not identify himself with the so-called \\\\`\\\\`movements'' that from time to time catch public attention, but aims only and constantly at the quiet betterment of mankind, may be mentioned as additional reasons why his name and fame have not been steadily blazoned.\\n\\nHe knows and will admit that he works hard and has all his life worked hard.  \\\\`\\\\`Things keep turning my way because I'm on the job,'' as he whimsically expressed it one day; but that is about all, so it seems to him.\\n\\nAnd he sincerely believes that his life has in itself been without interest; that it has been an essentially commonplace life with nothing of the interesting or the eventful to tell.  He is frankly surprised that there has ever been the desire to write about him.  He really has no idea of how fascinating are the things he has done.  His entire life has been of positive interest from the variety of things accomplished and the unexpectedness with which he has accomplished them.\\n\\nNever, for example, was there such an organizer.  In fact, organization and leadership have always been as the breath of life to him.  As a youth he organized debating societies and, before the war, a local military company.  While on garrison duty in the Civil War he organized what is believed to have been the first free school for colored children in the South.  One day Minneapolis happened to be spoken of, and Conwell happened to remember that he organized, when he was a lawyer in that city, what became the first Y.M.C.A. branch there.  Once he even started a newspaper.  And it was natural that the organizing instinct, as years advanced, should lead him to greater and greater things, such as his church, with the numerous associations formed within itself through his influence, and the university--the organizing of the university being in itself an achievement of positive romance.\\n\\n`A life without interest!''  Why, when I happened to ask, one day, how many Presidents he had known since Lincoln, he replied, quite casually, that he had `written the lives of most of them in their own homes''; and by this he meant either personally or in collaboration with the American biographer Abbott.\\n\\nThe many-sidedness of Conwell is one of the things that is always fascinating.  After you have quite got the feeling that he is peculiarly a man of to-day, lecturing on to-day's possibilities to the people of to-day, you happen upon some such fact as that he attracted the attention of the London *Times* through a lecture on Italian history at Cambridge in England; or that on the evening of the day on which he was admitted to practice in the Supreme Court of the United States he gave a lecture in Washington on \\\\`\\\\`The Curriculum of the Prophets in Ancient Israel.''  The man's life is a succession of delightful surprises.\\n\\nAn odd trait of his character is his love for fire.  He could easily have been a veritable fire- worshiper instead of an orthodox Christian!  He has always loved a blaze, and he says reminiscently that for no single thing was he punished so much when he was a child as for building bonfires.  And after securing possession, as he did in middle age, of the house where he was born and of a great acreage around about, he had one of the most enjoyable times of his life in tearing down old buildings that needed to be destroyed and in heaping up fallen trees and rubbish and in piling great heaps of wood and setting the great piles ablaze.  You see, there is one of the secrets of his strength--he has never lost the capacity for fiery enthusiasm!\\n\\nAlways, too, in these later years he is showing his strength and enthusiasm in a positively noble way.  He has for years been a keen sufferer from rheumatism and neuritis, but he has never permitted this to interfere with his work or plans.  He makes little of his sufferings, and when he slowly makes his way, bent and twisted, downstairs, he does not want to be noticed.  `I'm all right,'' he will say if any one offers to help, and at such a time comes his nearest approach to impatience.  He wants his suffering ignored.  Strength has always been to him so precious a belonging that he will not relinquish it while he lives.  `I'm all right!''  And he makes himself believe that he is all right even though the pain becomes so severe as to demand massage.  And he will still, even when suffering, talk calmly, or write his letters, or attend to whatever matters come before him.  It is the Spartan boy hiding the pain of the gnawing fox.  And he never has let pain interfere with his presence on the pulpit or the platform.  He has once in a while gone to a meeting on crutches and then, by the force of will, and inspired by what he is to do, has stood before his audience or congregation, a man full of strength and fire and life.\\n\\nVII\\n\\nHOW A UNIVERSITY WAS FOUNDED\\n\\nTHE story of the foundation and rise of Temple University is an extraordinary story; it is not only extraordinary, but inspiring; it is not only inspiring, but full of romance.\\n\\nFor the university came out of nothing!--nothing but the need of a young man and the fact that he told the need to one who, throughout his life, has felt the impulse to help any one in need and has always obeyed the impulse.\\n\\nI asked Dr. Conwell, up at his home in the Berkshires, to tell me himself just how the university began, and he said that it began because it was needed and succeeded because of the loyal work of the teachers.  And when I asked for details he was silent for a while, looking off into the brooding twilight as it lay over the waters and the trees and the hills, and then he said:\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`It was all so simple; it all came about so naturally.  One evening, after a service, a young man of the congregation came to me and I saw that he was disturbed about something.  I had him sit down by me, and I knew that in a few moments he would tell me what was troubling him.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\` `Dr. Conwell,' he said, abruptly, `I earn but little money, and I see no immediate chance of earning more.  I have to support not only myself, but my mother.  It leaves nothing at all.  Yet my longing is to be a minister.  It is the one ambition of my life.  Is there anything that I can do?'\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\` `Any man,' I said to him, `with the proper determination and ambition can study sufficiently at night to win his desire.'\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\` `I have tried to think so,' said he, `but I have not been able to see anything clearly.  I want to study, and am ready to give every spare minute to it, but I don't know how to get at it.'\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`I thought a few minutes, as I looked at him.  He was strong in his desire and in his ambition to fulfil it--strong enough, physically and mentally, for work of the body and of the mind--and he needed something more than generalizations of sympathy.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\` `Come to me one evening a week and I will begin teaching you myself,' I said, `and at least you will in that way make a beginning'; and I named the evening.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`His face brightened and he eagerly said that he would come, and left me; but in a little while he came hurrying back again.  \\\\`May I bring a friend with me?' he said.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`I told him to bring as many as he wanted to, for more than one would be an advantage, and when the evening came there were six friends with him.  And that first evening I began to teach them the foundations of Latin.''\\n\\nHe stopped as if the story was over.  He was looking out thoughtfully into the waning light, and I knew that his mind was busy with those days of the beginning of the institution he so loves, and whose continued success means so much to him.  In a little while he went on:\\n\\n`That was the beginning of it, and there is little more to tell.  By the third evening the number of pupils had increased to forty; others joined in helping me, and a room was hired; then a little house, then a second house.  From a few students and teachers we became a college.  After a while our buildings went up on Broad Street alongside the Temple Church, and after another while we became a university.  From the first our aim''--(I noticed how quickly it had become `our'' instead of `my'')--`our aim was to give education to those who were unable to get it through the usual channels.  And so that was really all there was to it.''\\n\\nThat was typical of Russell Conwell--to tell with brevity of what he has done, to point out the beginnings of something, and quite omit to elaborate as to the results.  And that, when you come to know him, is precisely what he means you to understand--that it is the beginning of anything that is important, and that if a thing is but earnestly begun and set going in the right way it may just as easily develop big results as little results.\\n\\nBut his story was very far indeed from being \\\\`\\\\`all there was to it,'' for he had quite omitted to state the extraordinary fact that, beginning with those seven pupils, coming to his library on an evening in 1884, the Temple University has numbered, up to Commencement-time in 1915, 88,821 students!  Nearly one hundred thousand students, and in the lifetime of the founder!  Really, the magnitude of such a work cannot be exaggerated, nor the vast importance of it when it is considered that most of these eighty-eight thousand students would not have received their education had it not been for Temple University.  And it all came from the instant response of Russell Conwell to the immediate need presented by a young man without money!\\n\\n`And there is something else I want to say,'' said Dr. Conwell, unexpectedly.  `I want to say, more fully than a mere casual word, how nobly the work was taken up by volunteer helpers; professors from the University of Pennsylvania and teachers from the public schools and other local institutions gave freely of what time they could until the new venture was firmly on its way.  I honor those who came so devotedly to help.  And it should be remembered that in those early days the need was even greater than it would now appear, for there were then no night schools or manual-training schools.  Since then the city of Philadelphia has gone into such work, and as fast as it has taken up certain branches the Temple University has put its energy into the branches just higher.  And there seems no lessening of the need of it,'' he added, ponderingly.\\n\\nNo; there is certainly no lessening of the need of it!  The figures of the annual catalogue would alone show that.\\n\\nAs early as 1887, just three years after the beginning, the Temple College, as it was by that time called, issued its first catalogue, which set forth with stirring words that the intent of its founding was to:\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Provide such instruction as shall be best adapted to the higher education of those who are compelled to labor at their trade while engaged in study.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Cultivate a taste for the higher and most useful branches of learning.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Awaken in the character of young laboring men and women a determined ambition to be useful to their fellow-men.''\\n\\nThe college--the university as it in time came to be--early broadened its scope, but it has from the first continued to aim at the needs of those unable to secure education without such help as, through its methods, it affords.\\n\\nIt was chartered in 1888, at which time its numbers had reached almost six hundred, and it has ever since had a constant flood of applicants.  `It has demonstrated,'' as Dr. Conwell puts it, `that those who work for a living have time for study.''  And he, though he does not himself add this, has given the opportunity.\\n\\nHe feels especial pride in the features by which lectures and recitations are held at practically any hour which best suits the convenience of the students.  If any ten students join in a request for any hour from nine in the morning to ten at night a class is arranged for them, to meet that request!  This involves the necessity for a much larger number of professors and teachers than would otherwise be necessary, but that is deemed a slight consideration in comparison with the immense good done by meeting the needs of workers.\\n\\nAlso President Conwell--for of course he is the president of the university--is proud of the fact that the privilege of graduation depends entirely upon knowledge gained; that graduation does not depend upon having listened to any set number of lectures or upon having attended for so many terms or years.  If a student can do four years' work in two years or in three he is encouraged to do it, and if he cannot even do it in four he can have no diploma.\\n\\nObviously, there is no place at Temple University for students who care only for a few years of leisured ease.  It is a place for workers, and not at all for those who merely wish to be able to boast that they attended a university.  The students have come largely from among railroad clerks, bank clerks, bookkeepers, teachers, preachers, mechanics, salesmen, drug clerks, city and United States government employees, widows, nurses, housekeepers, brakemen, firemen, engineers, motormen, conductors, and shop hands.\\n\\nIt was when the college became strong enough, and sufficiently advanced in scholarship and standing, and broad enough in scope, to win the name of university that this title was officially granted to it by the State of Pennsylvania, in 1907, and now its educational plan includes three distinct school systems.\\n\\nFirst: it offers a high-school education to the student who has to quit school after leaving the grammar-school.\\n\\nSecond: it offers a full college education, with the branches taught in long-established high- grade colleges, to the student who has to quit on leaving the high-school.\\n\\nThird: it offers further scientific or professional education to the college graduate who must go to work immediately on quitting college, but who wishes to take up some such course as law or medicine or engineering.\\n\\nOut of last year's enrolment of 3,654 it is interesting to notice that the law claimed 141; theology, 182; medicine and pharmacy and dentistry combined, 357; civil engineering, 37; also that the teachers' college, with normal courses on such subjects as household arts and science, kindergarten work, and physical education, took 174; and still more interesting, in a way, to see that 269 students were enrolled for the technical and vocational courses, such as cooking and dress- making, millinery, manual crafts, school-gardening, and story-telling.  There were 511 in high- school work, and 243 in elementary education.  There were 79 studying music, and 68 studying to be trained nurses.  There were 606 in the college of liberal arts and sciences, and in the department of commercial education there were 987--for it is a university that offers both scholarship and practicality.\\n\\nTemple University is not in the least a charitable institution.  Its fees are low, and its hours are for the convenience of the students themselves, but it is a place of absolute independence.  It is, indeed, a place of far greater independence, so one of the professors pointed out, than are the great universities which receive millions and millions of money in private gifts and endowments.\\n\\nTemple University in its early years was sorely in need of money, and often there were thrills of expectancy when some man of mighty wealth seemed on the point of giving.  But not a single one ever did, and now the Temple likes to feel that it is glad of it.  The Temple, to quote its own words, is \\\\`\\\\`An institution for strong men and women who can labor with both mind and body.''\\n\\nAnd the management is proud to be able to say that, although great numbers have come from distant places, \\\\`\\\\`not one of the many thousands ever failed to find an opportunity to support himself.''\\n\\nEven in the early days, when money was needed for the necessary buildings (the buildings of which Conwell dreamed when he left second-story doors in his church!), the university--college it was then called--had won devotion from those who knew that it was a place where neither time nor money was wasted, and where idleness was a crime, and in the donations for the work were many such items as four hundred dollars from factory-workers who gave fifty cents each, and two thousand dollars from policemen who gave a dollar each.  Within two or three years past the State of Pennsylvania has begun giving it a large sum annually, and this state aid is public recognition of Temple University as an institution of high public value.  The state money is invested in the brains and hearts of the ambitious.\\n\\nSo eager is Dr. Conwell to place the opportunity of education before every one, that even his servants must go to school!  He is not one of those who can see needs that are far away but not those that are right at home.  His belief in education, and in the highest attainable education, is profound, and it is not only on account of the abstract pleasure and value of education, but its power of increasing actual earning power and thus making a worker of more value to both himself and the community.\\n\\nMany a man and many a woman, while continuing to work for some firm or factory, has taken Temple technical courses and thus fitted himself or herself for an advanced position with the same employer.  The Temple knows of many such, who have thus won prominent advancement.  And it knows of teachers who, while continuing to teach, have fitted themselves through the Temple courses for professorships.  And it knows of many a case of the rise of a Temple student that reads like an Arabian Nights' fancy!--of advance from bookkeeper to editor, from office- boy to bank president, from kitchen maid to school principal, from street-cleaner to mayor!  The Temple University helps them that help themselves.\\n\\nPresident Conwell told me personally of one case that especially interested him because it seemed to exhibit, in especial degree, the Temple possibilities; and it particularly interested me because it also showed, in high degree, the methods and personality of Dr. Conwell himself.\\n\\nOne day a young woman came to him and said she earned only three dollars a week and that she desired very much to make more.  \\\\`\\\\`Can you tell me how to do it?'' she said.\\n\\nHe liked her ambition and her directness, but there was something that he felt doubtful about, and that was that her hat looked too expensive for three dollars a week!\\n\\nNow Dr. Conwell is a man whom you would never suspect of giving a thought to the hat of man or woman!  But as a matter of fact there is very little that he does not see.\\n\\nBut though the hat seemed too expensive for three dollars a week, Dr. Conwell is not a man who makes snap-judgments harshly, and in particular he would be the last man to turn away hastily one who had sought him out for help.  He never felt, nor could possibly urge upon any one, contentment with a humble lot; he stands for advancement; he has no sympathy with that dictum of the smug, that has come to us from a nation tight bound for centuries by its gentry and aristocracy, about being contented with the position in which God has placed you, for he points out that the Bible itself holds up advancement and success as things desirable.\\n\\nAnd, as to the young woman before him, it developed, through discreet inquiry veiled by frank discussion of her case, that she had made the expensive-looking hat herself!  Whereupon not only did all doubtfulness and hesitation vanish, but he saw at once how she could better herself.  He knew that a woman who could make a hat like that for herself could make hats for other people, and so, \\\\`\\\\`Go into millinery as a business,'' he advised.\\n\\n`Oh--if I only could!'' she exclaimed.  `But I know that I don't know enough.''\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`Take the millinery course in Temple University,'' he responded.\\n\\nShe had not even heard of such a course, and when he went on to explain how she could take it and at the same time continue at her present work until the course was concluded, she was positively ecstatic--it was all so unexpected, this opening of the view of a new and broader life.\\n\\n`She was an unusual woman,'' concluded Dr. Conwell, `and she worked with enthusiasm and tirelessness.  She graduated, went to an up-state city that seemed to offer a good field, opened a millinery establishment there, with her own name above the door, and became prosperous.  That was only a few years ago.  And recently I had a letter from her, telling me that last year she netted a clear profit of three thousand six hundred dollars!''\\n\\nI remember a man, himself of distinguished position, saying of Dr. Conwell, \\\\`\\\\`It is difficult to speak in tempered language of what he has achieved.''  And that just expresses it; the temptation is constantly to use superlatives--for superlatives fit!  Of course he has succeeded for himself, and succeeded marvelously, in his rise from the rocky hill farm, but he has done so vastly more than that in inspiring such hosts of others to succeed!\\n\\nA dreamer of dreams and a seer of visions-- and what realizations have come!  And it interested me profoundly not long ago, when Dr. Conwell, talking of the university, unexpectedly remarked that he would like to see such institu- tions scattered throughout every state in the Union.  `All carried on at slight expense to the students and at hours to suit all sorts of working men and women,'' he added, after a pause; and then, abruptly, `I should like to see the possibility of higher education offered to every one in the United States who works for a living.''\\n\\nThere was something superb in the very imagining of such a nation-wide system.  But I did not ask whether or not he had planned any details for such an effort.  I knew that thus far it might only be one of his dreams--but I also knew that his dreams had a way of becoming realities.  I had a fleeting glimpse of his soaring vision.  It was amazing to find a man of more than three- score and ten thus dreaming of more worlds to conquer.  And I thought, what could the world have accomplished if Methuselah had been a Conwell!--or, far better, what wonders could be accomplished if Conwell could but be a Methuselah!\\n\\nHe has all his life been a great traveler.  He is a man who sees vividly and who can describe vividly.  Yet often his letters, even from places of the most profound interest, are mostly concerned with affairs back home.  It is not that he does not feel, and feel intensely, the interest of what he is visiting, but that his tremendous earnestness keeps him always concerned about his work at home.  There could be no stronger example than what I noticed in a letter he wrote from Jerusa- lem.  `I am in Jerusalem!  And here at Gethsemane and at the Tomb of Christ''--reading thus far, one expects that any man, and especially a minister, is sure to say something regarding the associations of the place and the effect of these associations on his mind; but Conwell is always the man who is different--`And here at Gethsemane and at the Tomb of Christ, I pray especially for the Temple University.''  That is Conwellism!\\n\\nThat he founded a hospital--a work in itself great enough for even a great life is but one among the striking incidents of his career.  And it came about through perfect naturalness.  For he came to know, through his pastoral work and through his growing acquaintance with the needs of the city, that there was a vast amount of suffering and wretchedness and anguish, because of the inability of the existing hospitals to care for all who needed care.  There was so much sickness and suffering to be alleviated, there were so many deaths that could be prevented--and so he decided to start another hospital.\\n\\nAnd, like everything with him, the beginning was small.  That cannot too strongly be set down as the way of this phenomenally successful organizer.  Most men would have to wait until a big beginning could be made, and so would most likely never make a beginning at all.  But Conwell's way is to dream of future bigness, but be ready to begin at once, no matter how small or insignificant the beginning may appear to others.\\n\\nTwo rented rooms, one nurse, one patient--this was the humble beginning, in 1891, of what has developed into the great Samaritan Hospital.  In a year there was an entire house, fitted up with wards and operating-room.  Now it occupies several buildings, including and adjoining that first one, and a great new structure is planned.  But even as it is, it has a hundred and seventy beds, is fitted with all modern hospital appliances, and has a large staff of physicians; and the number of surgical operations performed there is very large.\\n\\nIt is open to sufferers of any race or creed, and the poor are never refused admission, the rule being that treatment is free for those who cannot pay, but that such as can afford it shall pay according to their means.\\n\\nAnd the hospital has a kindly feature that endears it to patients and their relatives alike, and that is that, by Dr. Conwell's personal order, there are not only the usual week-day hours for visiting, but also one evening a week and every Sunday afternoon.  `For otherwise,'' as he says, `many would be unable to come because they could not get away from their work.''\\n\\nA little over eight years ago another hospital was taken in charge, the Garretson--not founded by Conwell, this one, but acquired, and promptly expanded in its usefulness.\\n\\nBoth the Samaritan and the Garretson are part of Temple University.  The Samaritan Hospital has treated, since its foundation, up to the middle of 1915, 29,301 patients; the Garretson, in its shorter life, 5,923.  Including dispensary cases as well as house patients, the two hospitals together, under the headship of President Conwell, have handled over 400,000 cases.\\n\\nHow Conwell can possibly meet the multifarious demands upon his time is in itself a miracle.  He is the head of the great church; he is the head of the university; he is the head of the hospitals; he is the head of everything with which he is associated!  And he is not only nominally, but very actively, the head!\\n\\nVIII\\n\\nHIS SPLENDID EFFICIENCY\\n\\nCONWELL has a few strong and efficient executive helpers who have long been associated with him; men and women who know his ideas and ideals, who are devoted to him, and who do their utmost to relieve him; and of course there is very much that is thus done for him; but even as it is, he is so overshadowing a man (there is really no other word) that all who work with him look to him for advice and guidance the professors and the students, the doctors and the nurses, the church officers, the Sunday-school teachers, the members of his congregation.  And he is never too busy to see any one who really wishes to see him.\\n\\nHe can attend to a vast intricacy of detail, and answer myriad personal questions and doubts, and keep the great institutions splendidly going, by thorough systematization of time, and by watching every minute.  He has several secretaries, for special work, besides his private secretary.  His correspondence is very great.  Often he dictates to a secretary as he travels on the train.  Even in the few days for which he can run back to the Berkshires, work is awaiting him.  Work follows him.  And after knowing of this, one is positively amazed that he is able to give to his country-wide lectures the time and the traveling that they inexorably demand.  Only a man of immense strength, of the greatest stamina, a veritable superman, could possibly do it.  And at times one quite forgets, noticing the multiplicity of his occupations, that he prepares two sermons and two talks on Sunday!\\n\\nHere is his usual Sunday schedule, when at home.  He rises at seven and studies until breakfast, which is at eight-thirty.  Then he studies until nine-forty-five, when he leads a men's meeting at which he is likely also to play the organ and lead the singing.  At ten-thirty is the principal church service, at which he preaches, and at the close of which he shakes hands with hundreds.  He dines at one, after which he takes fifteen minutes' rest and then reads; and at three o'clock he addresses, in a talk that is like another sermon, a large class of men--not the same men as in the morning.  He is also sure to look in at the regular session of the Sunday-school.  Home again, where he studies and reads until supper-time.  At seven- thirty is the evening service, at which he again preaches and after which he shakes hands with several hundred more and talks personally, in his study, with any who have need of talk with him.  He is usually home by ten-thirty.  I spoke of it, one evening, as having been a strenuous day, and he responded, with a cheerfully whimsical smile:  \\\\`\\\\`Three sermons and shook hands with nine hundred.''\\n\\nThat evening, as the service closed, he had said to the congregation:  `I shall be here for an hour.  We always have a pleasant time together after service.  If you are acquainted with me, come up and shake hands.  If you are strangers''-- just the slightest of pauses--`come up and let us make an acquaintance that will last for eternity.''  I remember how simply and easily this was said, in his clear, deep voice, and how impressive and important it seemed, and with what unexpectedness it came.  \\\\`\\\\`Come and make an acquaintance that will last for eternity!''  And there was a serenity about his way of saying this which would make strangers think--just as he meant them to think--that he had nothing whatever to do but to talk with them.  Even his own congregation have, most of them, little conception of how busy a man he is and how precious is his time.\\n\\nOne evening last June to take an evening of which I happened to know--he got home from a journey of two hundred miles at six o'clock, and after dinner and a slight rest went to the church prayer-meeting, which he led in his usual vigorous way at such meetings, playing the organ and leading the singing, as well as praying and talk- ing.  After the prayer-meeting he went to two dinners in succession, both of them important dinners in connection with the close of the university year, and at both dinners he spoke.  At the second dinner he was notified of the sudden illness of a member of his congregation, and instantly hurried to the man's home and thence to the hospital to which he had been removed, and there he remained at the man's bedside, or in consultation with the physicians, until one in the morning.  Next morning he was up at seven and again at work.\\n\\n\\\\`\\\\`This one thing I do,'' is his private maxim of efficiency, and a literalist might point out that he does not one thing only, but a thousand things, not getting Conwell's meaning, which is that whatever the thing may be which he is doing he lets himself think of nothing else until it is done.\\n\\nDr. Conwell has a profound love for the country and particularly for the country of his own youth.  He loves the wind that comes sweeping over the hills, he loves the wide-stretching views from the heights and the forest intimacies of the nestled nooks.  He loves the rippling streams, he loves the wild flowers that nestle in seclusion or that unexpectedly paint some mountain meadow with delight.  He loves the very touch of the earth, and he loves the great bare rocks.\\n\\nHe writes verses at times; at least he has written lines for a few old tunes; and it interested me greatly to chance upon some lines of his that picture heaven in terms of the Berkshires:\\n\\n_ The wide-stretching valleys in colors so fadeless,  Where trees are all deathless and flowers e'er bloom_.\\n\\nThat is heaven in the eyes of a New England hill-man!  Not golden pavement and ivory palaces, but valleys and trees and flowers and the wide sweep of the open.\\n\\nFew things please him more than to go, for example, blackberrying, and he has a knack of never scratching his face or his fingers when doing so.  And he finds blackberrying, whether he goes alone or with friends, an extraordinarily good time for planning something he wishes to do or working out the thought of a sermon.  And fishing is even better, for in fishing he finds immense recreation and restfulness and at the same time a further opportunity to think and plan.\\n\\nAs a small boy he wished that he could throw a dam across the trout-brook that runs near the little Conwell home, and--as he never gives up-- he finally realized the ambition, although it was after half a century!  And now he has a big pond, three-quarters of a mile long by half a mile wide, lying in front of the house, down a slope from it-- a pond stocked with splendid pickerel.  He likes to float about restfully on this pond, thinking or fishing, or both.  And on that pond he showed me how to catch pickerel even under a blaze of sunlight!\\n\\nHe is a trout-fisher, too, for it is a trout stream that feeds this pond and goes dashing away from it through the wilderness; and for miles adjoining his place a fishing club of wealthy men bought up the rights in this trout stream, and they approached him with a liberal offer.  But he declined it.  \\\\`\\\\`I remembered what good times I had when I was a boy, fishing up and down that stream, and I couldn't think of keeping the boys of the present day from such a pleasure.  So they may still come and fish for trout here.''\\n\\nAs we walked one day beside this brook, he suddenly said:  \\\\`\\\\`Did you ever notice that every brook has its own song?  I should know the song of this brook anywhere.''\\n\\nIt would seem as if he loved his rugged native country because it is rugged even more than because it is native!  Himself so rugged, so hardy, so enduring--the strength of the hills is his also.\\n\\nAlways, in his very appearance, you see something of this ruggedness of the hills; a ruggedness, a sincerity, a plainness, that mark alike his character and his looks.  And always one realizes the strength of the man, even when his voice, as it usually is, is low.  And one increasingly realizes the strength when, on the lecture platform or in the pulpit or in conversation, he flashes vividly into fire.\\n\\nA big-boned man he is, sturdy-framed, a tall man, with broad shoulders and strong hands.  His hair is a deep chestnut-brown that at first sight seems black.  In his early manhood he was superb in looks, as his pictures show, but anxiety and work and the constant flight of years, with physical pain, have settled his face into lines of sadness and almost of severity, which instantly vanish when he speaks.  And his face is illumined by marvelous eyes.\\n\\nHe is a lonely man.  The wife of his early years died long, long ago, before success had come, and she was deeply mourned, for she had loyally helped him through a time that held much of struggle and hardship.  He married again; and this wife was his loyal helpmate for many years.  In a time of special stress, when a defalcation of sixty-five thousand dollars threatened to crush Temple College just when it was getting on its feet, for both Temple Church and Temple College had in those early days buoyantly assumed heavy indebtedness, he raised every dollar he could by selling or mortgaging his own possessions, and in this his wife, as he lovingly remembers, most cordially stood beside him, although she knew that if anything should happen to him the financial sacrifice would leave her penniless.  She died after years of companionship; his children married and made homes of their own; he is a lonely man.  Yet he is not unhappy, for the tremendous demands of his tremendous work leave him little time for sadness or retrospect.  At times the realization comes that he is getting old, that friends and comrades have been passing away, leaving him an old man with younger friends and helpers.  But such realization only makes him work with an earnestness still more intense, knowing that the night cometh when no man shall work.\\n\\nDeeply religious though he is, he does not force religion into conversation on ordinary subjects or upon people who may not be interested in it.  With him, it is action and good works, with faith and belief, that count, except when talk is the natural, the fitting, the necessary thing; when addressing either one individual or thousands, he talks with superb effectiveness.\\n\\nHis sermons are, it may almost literally be said, parable after parable; although he himself would be the last man to say this, for it would sound as if he claimed to model after the greatest of all examples.  His own way of putting it is that he uses stories frequently because people are more impressed by illustrations than by argument.\\n\\nAlways, whether in the pulpit or out of it, he is simple and homelike, human and unaffected.  If he happens to see some one in the congregation to whom he wishes to speak, he may just leave his pulpit and walk down the aisle, while the choir is singing, and quietly say a few words and return.\\n\\nIn the early days of his ministry, if he heard of a poor family in immediate need of food he would be quite likely to gather a basket of provisions and go personally, and offer this assistance and such other as he might find necessary when he reached the place.  As he became known he ceased from this direct and open method of charity, for he knew that impulsiveness would be taken for intentional display.  But he has never ceased to be ready to help on the instant that he knows help is needed.  Delay and lengthy investigation are avoided by him when he can be certain that something immediate is required.  And the extent of his quiet charity is amazing.  With no family for which to save money, and with no care to put away money for himself, he thinks only of money as an instrument for helpfulness.  I never heard a friend criticize him except for too great open-handedness.\\n\\nI was strongly impressed, after coming to know him, that he possessed many of the qualities that made for the success of the old-time district leaders of New York City, and I mentioned this to him, and he at once responded that he had himself met `Big Tim,'' the long-time leader of the Sullivans, and had had him at his house, Big Tim having gone to Philadelphia to aid some henchman in trouble, and having promptly sought the aid of Dr. Conwell.  And it was characteristic of Conwell that he saw, what so many never saw, the most striking characteristic of that Tammany leader.  For, `Big Tim Sullivan was so kind-hearted!''  Conwell appreciated the man's political unscrupulousness as well as did his enemies, but he saw also what made his underlying power--his kind-heartedness.  Except that Sullivan could be supremely unscrupulous, and that Conwell is supremely scrupulous, there were marked similarities in these masters over men; and Conwell possesses, as Sullivan possessed, a wonderful memory for faces and names.\\n\\nNaturally, Russell Conwell stands steadily and strongly for good citizenship.  But he never talks boastful Americanism.  He seldom speaks in so many words of either Americanism or good citizenship, but he constantly and silently keeps the American flag, as the symbol of good citizenship, before his people.  An American flag is prominent in his church; an American flag is seen in his home; a beautiful American flag is up at his Berkshire place and surmounts a lofty tower where, when he was a boy, there stood a mighty tree at the top of which was an eagle's nest, which has given him a name for his home, for he terms it \\\\`\\\\`The Eagle's Nest.''\\n\\nRemembering a long story that I had read of his climbing to the top of that tree, though it was a well-nigh impossible feat, and securing the nest by great perseverance and daring, I asked him if the story were a true one.  \\\\`\\\\`Oh, I've heard something about it; somebody said that somebody watched me, or something of the kind.  But I don't remember anything about it myself.''\\n\\nAny friend of his is sure to say something, after a while, about his determination, his insistence on going ahead with anything on which he has really set his heart.  One of the very important things on which he insisted, in spite of very great opposition, and especially an opposition from the other churches of his denomination (for this was a good many years ago, when there was much more narrowness in churches and sects than there is at present), was with regard to doing away with close communion.  He determined on an open communion; and his way of putting it, once decided upon, was:  \\\\`\\\\`My friends, it is not for me to invite you to the table of the Lord.  The table of the Lord is open.  If you feel that you can come to the table, it is open to you.''  And this is the form which he still uses.\\n\\nHe not only never gives up, but, so his friends say, he never forgets a thing upon which he has once decided, and at times, long after they supposed the matter has been entirely forgotten, they suddenly find Dr. Conwell bringing his original purpose to pass.  When I was told of this I remembered that pickerel-pond in the Berkshires!\\n\\nIf he is really set upon doing anything, little or big, adverse criticism does not disturb his serenity.  Some years ago he began wearing a huge diamond, whose size attracted much criticism and caustic comment.  He never said a word in defense; he just kept on wearing the diamond.  One day, however, after some years, he took it off, and people said, `He has listened to the criticism at last!''  He smiled reminiscently as he told me about this, and said:  `A dear old deacon of my congregation gave me that diamond and I did not like to hurt his feelings by refusing it.  It really bothered me to wear such a glaring big thing, but because I didn't want to hurt the old deacon's feelings I kept on wearing it until he was dead.  Then I stopped wearing it.''\\n\\nThe ambition of Russell Conwell is to continue working and working until the very last moment of his life.  In work he forgets his sadness, his loneliness, his age.  And he said to me one day, \\\\`\\\\`I will die in harness.''\\n\\nIX\\n\\nTHE STORY OF ACRES OF DIAMONDS\\n\\nCONSIDERING everything, the most remarkable thing in Russell Conwell's remarkable life is his lecture, `Acres of Diamonds.''  That is, the lecture itself, the number of times he has delivered it, what a source of inspiration it has been to myriads, the money that he has made and is making, and, still more, the purpose to which he directs the money.  In the circumstances surrounding `Acres of Diamonds,'' in its tremendous success, in the attitude of mind revealed by the lecture itself and by what Dr. Conwell does with it, it is illuminative of his character, his aims, his ability.\\n\\nThe lecture is vibrant with his energy.  It flashes with his hopefulness.  It is full of his enthusiasm.  It is packed full of his intensity.  It stands for the possibilities of success in every one.  He has delivered it over five thousand times.  The demand for it never diminishes.  The success grows never less.\\n\\nThere is a time in Russell Conwell's youth of which it is pain for him to think.  He told me of it one evening, and his voice sank lower and lower as he went far back into the past.  It was of his days at Yale that he spoke, for they were days of suffering.  For he had not money for Yale, and in working for more he endured bitter humiliation.  It was not that the work was hard, for Russell Conwell has always been ready for hard work.  It was not that there were privations\\n\\nand difficulties, for he has always found difficulties only things to overcome, and endured privations with cheerful fortitude.  But it was the humiliations that he met--the personal humiliations that after more than half a century make him suffer in remembering them--yet out of those humiliations came a marvelous result.\\n\\n`I determined,'' he says, `that whatever I could do to make the way easier at college for other young men working their way I would do.''\\n\\nAnd so, many years ago, he began to devote every dollar that he made from \\\\`\\\\`Acres of Diamonds'' to this definite purpose.  He has what may be termed a waiting-list.  On that list are very few cases he has looked into personally.  Infinitely busy man that he is, he cannot do extensive personal investigation.  A large proportion of his names come to him from college presidents who know of students in their own colleges in need of such a helping hand.\\n\\n`Every night,'' he said, when I asked him to tell me about it, `when my lecture is over and the check is in my hand, I sit down in my room in the hotel''--what a lonely picture, tool--`I sit down in my room in the hotel and subtract from the total sum received my actual expenses for that place, and make out a check for the difference and send it to some young man on my list.  And I always send with the check a letter of advice and helpfulness, expressing my hope that it will be of some service to him and telling him that he is to feel under no obligation except to his Lord.  I feel strongly, and I try to make every young man feel, that there must be no sense of obligation to me personally.  And I tell them that I am hoping to leave behind me men who will do more work than I have done.  Don't think that I put in too much advice,'' he added, with a smile, `for I only try to let them know that a friend is trying to help them.''\\n\\nHis face lighted as he spoke.  `There is such a fascination in it!'' he exclaimed.  `It is just like a gamble!  And as soon as I have sent the letter and crossed a name off my list, I am aiming for the next one!''\\n\\nAnd after a pause he added:  `I do not attempt to send any young man enough for all his expenses.  But I want to save him from bitterness, and each check will help.  And, too,'' he concluded, na<i:>vely, in the vernacular, `I don't want them to lay down on me!''\\n\\nHe told me that he made it clear that he did not wish to get returns or reports from this branch of his life-work, for it would take a great deal of time in watching and thinking and in the reading and writing of letters.  `But it is mainly,'' he went on, `that I do not wish to hold over their heads the sense of obligation.''\\n\\nWhen I suggested that this was surely an example of bread cast upon the waters that could not return, he was silent for a little and then said, thoughtfully:  \\\\`\\\\`As one gets on in years there is satisfaction in doing a thing for the sake of doing it.  The bread returns in the sense of effort made.''\\n\\nOn a recent trip through Minnesota he was positively upset, so his secretary told me, through being recognized on a train by a young man who had been helped through \\\\`\\\\`Acres of Diamonds,'' and who, finding that this was really Dr. Conwell, eagerly brought his wife to join him in most fervent thanks for his assistance.  Both the husband and his wife were so emotionally overcome that it quite overcame Dr. Conwell himself.\\n\\nThe lecture, to quote the noble words of Dr. Conwell himself, is designed to help \\\\`\\\\`every person, of either sex, who cherishes the high resolve of sustaining a career of usefulness and honor.''  It is a lecture of helpfulness.  And it is a lecture, when given with Conwell's voice and face and manner, that is full of fascination.  And yet it is all so simple!\\n\\nIt is packed full of inspiration, of suggestion, of aid.  He alters it to meet the local circumstances of the thousands of different places in\\n\\nwhich he delivers it.  But the base remains the same.  And even those to whom it is an old story will go to hear him time after time.  It amuses him to say that he knows individuals who have listened to it twenty times.\\n\\nIt begins with a story told to Conwell by an old Arab as the two journeyed together toward Nineveh, and, as you listen, you hear the actual voices and you see the sands of the desert and the waving palms.  The lecturer's voice is so easy, so effortless, it seems so ordinary and matter-of- fact--yet the entire scene is instantly vital and alive!  Instantly the man has his audience under a sort of spell, eager to listen, ready to be merry or grave.  He has the faculty of control, the vital quality that makes the orator.\\n\\nThe same people will go to hear this lecture over and over, and that is the kind of tribute that Conwell likes.  I recently heard him deliver it in his own church, where it would naturally be thought to be an old story, and where, presumably, only a few of the faithful would go; but it was quite clear that all of his church are the faithful, for it was a large audience that came to listen to him; hardly a seat in the great auditorium was vacant.  And it should be added that, although it was in his own church, it was not a free lecture, where a throng might be expected, but that each one paid a liberal sum for a seat--and the paying of admission is always a practical test of the sincerity of desire to hear.  And the people were swept along by the current as if lecturer and lecture were of novel interest.  The lecture in itself is good to read, but it is only when it is illumined by Conwell's vivid personality that one understands how it influences in the actual delivery.\\n\\nOn that particular evening he had decided to give the lecture in the same form as when he first delivered it many years ago, without any of the alterations that have come with time and changing localities, and as he went on, with the audience rippling and bubbling with laughter as usual, he never doubted that he was giving it as he had given it years before; and yet--so up-to-date and alive must he necessarily be, in spite of a definitive effort to set himself back--every once in a while he was coming out with illustrations from such distinctly recent things as the automobile!\\n\\nThe last time I heard him was the 5,124th time for the lecture.  Doesn't it seem incredible!  5,124 times' I noticed that he was to deliver it at a little out-of-the-way place, difficult for any considerable number to get to, and I wondered just how much of an audience would gather and how they would be impressed.  So I went over from there I was, a few miles away.  The road was dark and I pictured a small audience, but when I got there I found the church building in which he was to deliver the lecture had a seating capacity of 830 and that precisely 830 people were already seated there and that a fringe of others were standing behind.  Many had come from miles away.  Yet the lecture had scarcely, if at all, been advertised.  But people had said to one another:  \\\\`\\\\`Aren't you going to hear Dr. Conwell?''  And the word had thus been passed along.\\n\\nI remember how fascinating it was to watch that audience, for they responded so keenly and with such heartfelt pleasure throughout the entire lecture.  And not only were they immensely pleased and amused and interested--and to achieve that at a crossroads church was in itself a triumph to be proud of--but I knew that every listener was given an impulse toward doing something for himself and for others, and that with at least some of them the impulse would materialize in acts.  Over and over one realizes what a power such a man wields.\\n\\nAnd what an unselfishness!  For, far on in years as he is, and suffering pain, he does not chop down his lecture to a definite length; he does not talk for just an hour or go on grudgingly for an hour and a half.  He sees that the people are fascinated and inspired, and he forgets pain, ignores time, forgets that the night is late and that he has a long journey to go to get home, and keeps on generously for two hours!  And every one wishes it were four.\\n\\nAlways he talks with ease and sympathy.  There are geniality, composure, humor, simple and homely jests--yet never does the audience forget that he is every moment in tremendous earnest.  They bubble with responsive laughter or are silent in riveted attention.  A stir can be seen to sweep over an audience, of earnestness or surprise or amusement or resolve.  When he is grave and sober or fervid the people feel that he is himself a fervidly earnest man, and when he is telling something humorous there is on his part almost a repressed chuckle, a genial appreciation of the fun of it, not in the least as if he were laughing at his own humor, but as if he and his hearers were laughing together at something of which they were all humorously cognizant.\\n\\nMyriad successes in life have come through the direct inspiration of this single lecture.  One hears of so many that there must be vastly more that are never told.  A few of the most recent were told me by Dr. Conwell himself, one being of a farmer boy who walked a long distance to hear him.  On his way home, so the boy, now a man, has written him, he thought over and over of what he could do to advance himself, and before he reached home he learned that a teacher was wanted at a certain country school.  He knew he did not know enough to teach, but was sure he could learn, so he bravely asked for the place.  And something in his earnestness made him win a temporary appointment.  Thereupon he worked and studied so hard and so devotedly, while he daily taught, that within a few months he was regularly employed there.  `And now,'' says Conwell, abruptly, with his characteristic skim- ming over of the intermediate details between the important beginning of a thing and the satisfactory end, `and now that young man is one of our college presidents.''\\n\\nAnd very recently a lady came to Dr. Conwell, the wife of an exceptionally prominent man who was earning a large salary, and she told him that her husband was so unselfishly generous with money that often they were almost in straits.  And she said they had bought a little farm as a country place, paying only a few hundred dollars for it, and that she had said to herself, laughingly, after hearing the lecture, `There are no acres of diamonds on this place!''  But she also went on to tell that she had found a spring of exceptionally fine water there, although in buying they had scarcely known of the spring at all; and she had been so inspired by Conwell that she had had the water analyzed and, finding that it was remarkably pure, had begun to have it bottled and sold under a trade name as special spring water.  And she is making money.  And she also sells pure ice from the pool, cut in winter-time and all because of `Acres of Diamonds''!\\n\\nSeveral millions of dollars, in all, have been received by Russell Conwell as the proceeds from this single lecture.  Such a fact is almost staggering-- and it is more staggering to realize what good is done in the world by this man, who does not earn for himself, but uses his money in immediate helpfulness.  And one can neither think nor write with moderation when it is further realized that far more good than can be done directly with money he does by uplifting and inspiring with this lecture.  Always his heart is with the weary and the heavy-laden.  Always he stands for self-betterment.\\n\\nLast year, 1914, he and his work were given unique recognition.  For it was known by his friends that this particular lecture was approaching its five-thousandth delivery, and they planned a celebration of such an event in the history of the most popular lecture in the world.  Dr. Conwell agreed to deliver it in the Academy of Music, in Philadelphia, and the building was packed and the streets outside were thronged.  The proceeds from all sources for that five-thousandth lecture were over nine thousand dollars.\\n\\nThe hold which Russell Conwell has gained on the affections and respect of his home city was seen not only in the thousands who strove to hear him, but in the prominent men who served on the local committee in charge of the celebration.  There was a national committee, too, and the nation-wide love that he has won, the nation- wide appreciation of what he has done and is still doing, was shown by the fact that among the names of the notables on this committee were those of nine governors of states.  The Governor of Pennsylvania was himself present to do Russell Conwell honor, and he gave to him a key emblematic of the Freedom of the State.\\n\\nThe \\\\`\\\\`Freedom of the State''--yes; this man, well over seventy, has won it.  The Freedom of the State, the Freedom of the Nation--for this man of helpfulness, this marvelous exponent of the gospel of success, has worked marvelously for the freedom, the betterment, the liberation, the advancement, of the individual.\\n\\nFIFTY YEARS ON THE LECTURE PLATFORM\\n\\nBY RUSSELL H. CONWELL\\n\\nAN Autobiography!  What an absurd request!  If all the conditions were favorable, the story of my public Life could not be made interesting.  It does not seem possible that any will care to read so plain and uneventful a tale.  I see nothing in it for boasting, nor much that could be helpful.  Then I never saved a scrap of paper intentionally concerning my work to which I could refer, not a book, not a sermon, not a lecture, not a newspaper notice or account, not a magazine article, not one of the kind biographies written from time to time by noble friends have I ever kept even as a souvenir, although some of them may be in my library.  I have ever felt that the writers concerning my life were too generous and that my own work was too hastily done.  Hence I have nothing upon which to base an autobiographical account, except the recollections which come to an overburdened mind.\\n\\nMy general view of half a century on the lecture platform brings to me precious and beautiful memories, and fills my soul with devout gratitude for the blessings and kindnesses which have been given to me so far beyond my deserts.  So much more success has come to my hands than I ever expected; so much more of good have I found than even youth's wildest dream included; so much more effective have been my weakest endeavors than I ever planned or hoped-- that a biography written truthfully would be mostly an account of what men and women have done for me.\\n\\nI have lived to see accomplished far more than my highest ambition included, and have seen the enterprises I have undertaken rush by me, pushed on by a thousand strong hands until they have left me far behind them.  The realities are like dreams to me.  Blessings on the loving hearts and noble minds who have been so willing to sacrifice for others' good and to think only of what they could do, and never of what they should get!  Many of them have ascended into the Shining Land, and here I am in mine age gazing up alone,\\n\\n*Only waiting till the shadows  Are a little longer grown*.\\n\\nFifty years!  I was a young man, not yet of age, when I delivered my first platform lecture.  The Civil War of 1861-65 drew on with all its passions, patriotism, horrors, and fears, and I was studying law at Yale University.  I had from childhood felt that I was \\\\`\\\\`called to the ministry.''  The earliest event of memory is the prayer of my father at family prayers in the little old cottage in the Hampshire highlands of the Berkshire Hills, calling on God with a sobbing voice to lead me into some special service for the Saviour.  It filled me with awe, dread, and fear, and I recoiled from the thought, until I determined to fight against it with all my power.  So I sought for other professions and for decent excuses for being anything but a preacher.\\n\\nYet while I was nervous and timid before the class in declamation and dreaded to face any kind of an audience, I felt in my soul a strange impulsion toward public speaking which for years made me miserable.  The war and the public meetings for recruiting soldiers furnished an outlet for my suppressed sense of duty, and my first lecture was on the \\\\`\\\\`Lessons of History'' as applied to the campaigns against the Confederacy.\\n\\nThat matchless temperance orator and loving friend, John B. Gough, introduced me to the little audience in Westfield, Massachusetts, in 1862.  What a foolish little school-boy speech it must have been!  But Mr. Gough's kind words of praise, the bouquets and the applause, made me feel that somehow the way to public oratory would not be so hard as I had feared.\\n\\nFrom that time I acted on Mr. Gough's advice and `sought practice'' by accepting almost every invitation I received to speak on any kind of a subject.  There were many sad failures and tears, but it was a restful compromise with my conscience concerning the ministry, and it pleased my friends.  I addressed picnics, Sunday-schools, patriotic meetings, funerals, anniversaries, commencements, debates, cattle-shows, and sewing-circles without partiality and without price.  For the first five years the income was all experience.  Then voluntary gifts began to come occasionally in the shape of a jack-knife, a ham, a book, and the first cash remuneration was from a farmers' club, of seventy-five cents toward the `horse hire.''  It was a curious fact that one member of that club afterward moved to Salt Lake City and was a member of the committee at the Mormon Tabernacle in 1872 which, when I was a correspondent, on a journey around the world, employed me to lecture on \\\\`\\\\`Men of the Mountains'' in the Mormon Tabernacle, at a fee of five hundred dollars.\\n\\nWhile I was gaining practice in the first years of platform work, I had the good fortune to have profitable employment as a soldier, or as a correspondent or lawyer, or as an editor or as a preacher, which enabled me to pay my own expenses, and it has been seldom in the fifty years that I have ever taken a fee for my personal use.  In the last thirty-six years I have dedicated solemnly all the lecture income to benevolent enterprises.  If I am antiquated enough for an autobiography, perhaps I may be aged enough to avoid the criticism of being an egotist, when I state that some years I delivered one lecture, \\\\`\\\\`Acres of Diamonds,'' over two hundred times each year, at an average income of about one hundred and fifty dollars for each lecture.\\n\\nIt was a remarkable good fortune which came to me as a lecturer when Mr. James Redpath organized the first lecture bureau ever established.  Mr. Redpath was the biographer of John Brown of Harper's Ferry renown, and as Mr. Brown had been long a friend of my father's I found employment, while a student on vacation, in selling that life of John Brown.  That acquaintance with Mr. Redpath was maintained until Mr. Redpath's death.  To General Charles H. Taylor, with whom I was employed for a time as reporter for the Boston *Daily Traveler*, I was indebted for many acts of self-sacrificing friendship which soften my soul as I recall them.  He did me the greatest kindness when he suggested my name to Mr. Redpath as one who could `fill in the vacancies in the smaller towns'' where the `great lights could not always be secured.''\\n\\nWhat a glorious galaxy of great names that original list of Redpath lecturers contained!  Henry Ward Beecher, John B. Gough, Senator Charles Sumner, Theodore Tilton, Wendell Phillips, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, Bayard Taylor, Ralph Waldo Emerson, with many of the great preachers, musicians, and writers of that remarkable era.  Even Dr. Holmes, John Whittier, Henry W. Longfellow, John Lothrop Motley, George William Curtis, and General Burnside were persuaded to appear one or more times, although they refused to receive pay.  I cannot forget how ashamed I felt when my name ap- peared in the shadow of such names, and how sure I was that every acquaintance was ridiculing me behind my back.  Mr. Bayard Taylor, however, wrote me from the *Tribune* office a kind note saying that he was glad to see me `on the road to great usefulness.''  Governor Clafflin, of Massachusetts, took the time to send me a note of congratulation. General Benjamin F. Butler, however, advised me to `stick to the last'' and be a good lawyer.\\n\\nThe work of lecturing was always a task and a duty.  I do not feel now that I ever sought to be an entertainer.  I am sure I would have been an utter failure but for the feeling that I must preach some gospel truth in my lectures and do at least that much toward that ever-persistent \\\\`\\\\`call of God.''  When I entered the ministry (1879) I had become so associated with the lecture platform in America and England that I could not feel justified in abandoning so great a field of usefulness.\\n\\nThe experiences of all our successful lecturers are probably nearly alike.  The way is not always smooth.  But the hard roads, the poor hotels, the late trains, the cold halls, the hot church auditoriums, the overkindness of hospitable committees, and the broken hours of sleep are annoyances one soon forgets; and the hosts of intelligent faces, the messages of thanks, and the effects of the earnings on the lives of young college men can never cease to be a daily joy.  God bless them all.\\n\\nOften have I been asked if I did not, in fifty years of travel in all sorts of conveyances, meet with accidents.  It is a marvel to me that no such event ever brought me harm.  In a continuous period of over twenty-seven years I delivered about two lectures in every three days, yet I did not miss a single engagement.  Sometimes I had to hire a special train, but I reached the town on time, with only a rare exception, and then I was but a few minutes late.  Accidents have preceded and followed me on trains and boats, and were sometimes in sight, but I was preserved without injury through all the years.  In the Johnstown flood region I saw a bridge go out behind our train.  I was once on a derelict steamer on the Atlantic for twenty-six days.  At another time a man was killed in the berth of a sleeper I had left half an hour before.  Often have I felt the train leave the track, but no one was killed.  Robbers have several times threatened my life, but all came out without loss to me.  God and man have ever been patient with me.\\n\\nYet this period of lecturing has been, after all, a side issue.  The Temple, and its church, in Philadelphia, which, when its membership was less than three thousand members, for so many years contributed through its membership over sixty thousand dollars a year for the uplift of humanity, has made life a continual surprise; while the Samaritan Hospital's amazing growth, and the Garretson Hospital's dispensaries, have been so continually ministering to the sick and poor, and have done such skilful work for the tens of thousands who ask for their help each year, that I have been made happy while away lecturing by the feeling that each hour and minute they were faithfully doing good.  Temple University, which was founded only twenty-seven years ago, has already sent out into a higher income and nobler life nearly a hundred thousand young men and women who could not probably have obtained an education in any other institution.  The faithful, self-sacrificing faculty, now numbering two hundred and fifty-three professors, have done the real work.  For that I can claim but little credit; and I mention the University here only to show that my \\\\`\\\\`fifty years on the lecture platform'' has necessarily been a side line of work.\\n\\nMy best-known lecture, `Acres of Diamonds,'' was a mere accidental address, at first given before a reunion of my old comrades of the Forty- sixth Massachusetts Regiment, which served in the Civil War and in which I was captain.  I had no thought of giving the address again, and even after it began to be called for by lecture committees I did not dream that I should live to deliver it, as I now have done, almost five thousand times.  `What is the secret of its popularity?'' I could never explain to myself or others.  I simply know that I always attempt to enthuse myself on each occasion with the idea that it is a special opportunity to do good, and I interest myself in each community and apply the general principles with local illustrations.\\n\\nThe hand which now holds this pen must in the natural course of events soon cease to gesture on the platform, and it is a sincere, prayerful hope that this book will go on into the years doing increasing good for the aid of my brothers and sisters in the human family.
