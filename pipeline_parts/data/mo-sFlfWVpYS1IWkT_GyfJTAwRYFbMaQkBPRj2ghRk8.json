People no longer worry about what or who they will be– their path is selected for them by a powerful AI integrated into every citizen since the day they were born. The system, if you ask anyone, works. The AI brought an end to war. It streamlined production and distribution. There is no unemployment, nobody left behind. Everyone is suited for their role and their role for them. It even reminds you when you need to drink water!\\n\\nNoah, Sol, and Talia, each living in one of the three major cities in the region, face their eighteenth birthdays — and life paths — with a mixture of dread and excitement. But when the time comes, their worlds crack at the seams. The paths don’t make sense. Noah would be throwing away years of schooling. Sol would be doomed to a life he knows he would hate. And Talia would have worked all her life, giving up everything, just to be trapped in the same world she grew up in.\\n\\nWhen friends and family are no help, each turn to the world for answers or escape. Their three journeys, diverging and intertwining, take them through the darkest and wildest corners of the societies they thought they knew so well, through the desert and its tribes who have turned their back on technology, and finally, to Ekur. Where there might be answers — or there might just be more questions.\\n\\n*Journey to Ekur* delves into our own agency: how do we become who we become? How do we balance our wants with those of others? And how do we find ourselves when everyone around us seems to already know exactly how to live?\\n\\nThanks for showing interest in The Journey to Ekur its a Sci-Fi novel and I will be publishing a new Chapter here and on Medium:\\n\\n[https://ahmedb-eth.medium.com/](https://ahmedb-eth.medium.com/)\\n\\nIf you are more of an Audio person then you can listen to it on Spotify here:\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/show/5dhv0JdVXPtzzgMFhGcwUU](https://open.spotify.com/show/5dhv0JdVXPtzzgMFhGcwUU)\\n\\nIt's my first time working on a project like this and I really hope that you enjoy it\\n\\nIf you want to support the project then you can check out the Novel’s NFT here:\\n\\n[https://foundation.app/@ahmedb.eth](https://foundation.app/@ahmedb.eth)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639032374,\"title\":\"The Journey to Ekur\"},\"digest\":\"xUXHni1qzmZNFaWq2gLhMD_300DhMKlv2MPqdDJAb1M\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xcac28b391dA1F25Cb329C3E24794e1d0D354EaeF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WZ8ba97H9eWwlJqrt03w3f61znv3WY1hq0Bok2sxIDU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e7YNxgUMkLd0y3dwHWE_G_rYokjAmsbkiBwaDk1FtgU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sMykzHiR1vrDZ_eXPwPn8A6VYb2XJiHyktPzo_BKbXoEWqERwEtk0Fxa6HiwWQkU25BSodrAEkg-klVhWRzEZA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1a2d400b2814bbb22e6e20d6b4a9084b2f6ed043e2e85e4ac125d9d9c1e54f6355d9702883c9d87173ea08705f22988a284b7d45add4bab89ee7b65683502cf71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WZ8ba97H9eWwlJqrt03w3f61znv3WY1hq0Bok2sxIDU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e7YNxgUMkLd0y3dwHWE_G_rYokjAmsbkiBwaDk1FtgU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"O9Haei9SjPDqaAzSQvx67MS3-lOvfO31WZX2Ge9EDeo\"}"
