Also might connect with the transparency dashboard project and perhaps something related to conservation.\\n\\n### Sobol member directory\\n\\n![a glimpse of people getting setup](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/i_qc0H1q8Vyfku6gyBjiB.png?height=1206&width=2354)\\n\\n*Leveraging a tool designed for DAOs to better visualize the DAO in all its forms: member directory, mind-maps of working groups, projects, channels, etc.*\\n\\n**Update**: Sobol has been rolled out to Citizens.

There are plans to better curate the NFTs on the museum website, but also some interesting work around using CityDAO’s crypto voxel space as gallery that Citizens can come visit!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VFpluIzD7z6bq9_dbUPL-.png?height=1420&width=2772)\\n\\n### Legal\\n\\nThis is an ongoing project and one of the most important within the DAO given our ambitions and having to interface with legacy systems. We have done a lot of lawyer consultations and will continue to work with lawyers, but we’ve also got many lawyers and legal experts in the community - I look forward to their continued contribution! :)\\n\\nHere’s an interesting framework shared:\\n\\n[https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DAO-Legal-Framework-Jennings-Kerr10.19.21-Final.pdf](https://a16z.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DAO-Legal-Framework-Jennings-Kerr10.19.21-Final.pdf)\\n\\n### City Tour Website (onboarding)\\n\\n*Onboarding site for those first encountering the DAO.

You can join then and we can help get you up to speed. Our goal is to transfer all the energy and enthusiasm around CityDAO into productive capacity and output to help build the City. Right now we're working on creating a pipeline for Citizens to turn their shower thoughts in Discord into actual projects that are executed on. - @ronaldinho*\\n\\n### Land-token-standard\\n\\n*Develop a standard for land ownership tokens. Will later extend to more specific use cases such as rental properties and fractionalized land ownership.*\\n\\nThis project is currently archived and on hold as consultation with lawyers happen.\\n\\n### Transparency-dashboard\\n\\n*Contract for tracking DAO-owned wallets and transactions. Frontend dashboard for displaying DAO's funds and uses*\\n\\nI love this project.\\n\\n**Update**: looks like there is work being done here and with business-ops to ensure taxes, etc are handled correctly.\\n\\n### Dev processes\\n\\n*Establishment of best practices and assisting the various teams in operational efficiency.*\\n\\n### Land-focus: Project-2 ideas\\n\\n*Developing ideas for the DAO’s next big project.*\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n# 🎤 Overheard in CityDAO\\n\\n*Random lines taken out of context from the CityDAO community*\\n\\n> \\\"Democratizing and digitizing physical assets since 2021\\\" love that\\n\\n> Such an energizing start to my day to see shared enthusiasm and patience for what this community is trying to unfold together.\\n\\n> So looking forward to seeing CityDAO grow\\n\\n> Oh nice, didn't know that there are so many Germany here.

A friend of mine had raised $50m in ETH late 2017. He ended with $10m in 2018\\n\\n> And 100% would be awesome for in-person citizen events w a free-to-join metaverse event.\\\"\\n\\n> What I’m most impressed about with this project is the willingness to take action.It takes a lot of courage to be the first! So good job to you all of you\\n\\n> it’s crazy how many people from all around the world are in here now!\\n\\n> Starting late December I will be in Virginia. Hope to meet up with some of your east coasters soon. Bummed I didn’t make it to any of the LA stuff but someday we will all meet at some cool global Summit on CityDAO land in one of the very first Crypto cities\\n\\n> Im not a citizen but can i still participate i wanna be apart of this history too if i can i would like to donate this NFT to the museum so i can be apart of history along with my favorite artist\\n\\n> Yes I have contacted core team at IoTeX and is ready to support dev for connecting to blockchain. We need to have a first kick off meeting to list down the items, scope, tasks delegate, execution plan, etc\\n\\n> I am happy to be from citydao 🔥\\n\\n> thank you for your previous help, recently I've notice citizens are interested in testing environmentally/agro-technology city tests, would like to know if there is a way to test and collab with community maybe in metaverse. We can find these discussions in research channel🙏\\n\\n> Where can I can get one of those cool CityDAO flags I can take a picture with in Tel Aviv? 😎\\n\\n> Sensera Systems just called, they are sending over a quote for two systems types to compare. Great conversation, will reply with the info asap.\\n\\n> City dao is love. CityDao is life\\n\\n> I dream of living in Wyoming with low tax and a bunch of like minded people in a place we built to meet our needs instead of one that we conform toare we actually going to be able to own physical land in WY as an NFT!?!?!? this is what I've been dreaming of\\n\\n> I have done a french traduction of the Constitution\\n\\n> Hmm i wonder what kind of data budget we'd tally up running the stream 24/7...i think they max out at 20GB. For their prepaid data plan\\n\\n> Coin Desk's Nathaniel Whittemore with a \\\"Breakdown\\\" podcast this morning on \\\"Can DAOs be a 10X Improvement for Fundraising?\\\"\\n\\n> They all have very brave urban visions for future cities. Hope our community could develop our own version\\n\\n> the real question is do we host is on American or canadian side?\\n\\n> \\\"Thank you for your kind reply, would love to organize this, this is aligned with my research and teaching, and I have a group of architect/professor friends who is working on related topics.\\n\\n> For lectures/workshops we could first make a channel, make polls or votes to collect questions and identify primary concerns on city design of our DAO: ecology, logistics, technology, blockchain etc.  Then we could deicide a theme and curate the workshop/ invite suitable people to deliver the lectures. After this, we could work together and produce a introductory/entry level guides for our DAO's city design/ research pamphlet for public review.  According to our guideline/pamphlet, we could start to experiment on building the city in metaverse.\\n\\n> If we can attract more community members to involve, I believe we could produce some very innovative works since we already have so many talented members from many different areas with different expertise.\\\"\\n\\n> I decide to remain anon, you can find my recent threads on these topics, will continue to publish works via twitter and collab via DAO.\\n\\n> HEY EVERYONE: If you were planning to come to the NYC CityDAO meet up please note that it has been POSTPONED due to COVID concerns.\\n\\n# 🐦 Tweets we love\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/moverandschafer/status/1467256561173090306?s=20](https://twitter.com/moverandschafer/status/1467256561173090306?s=20)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/winditus_crypto/status/1471204920334315521?s=20](https://twitter.com/winditus_crypto/status/1471204920334315521?s=20)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/davecraige/status/1471251662710841347?s=20](https://twitter.com/davecraige/status/1471251662710841347?s=20)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/getprsm/status/1470642140107526146?s=20](https://twitter.com/getprsm/status/1470642140107526146?s=20)\\n\\n## 🎨 Memes to go\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/OppYyOphMpe6iLDPr_n2y.png?height=672&width=500)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0Amuf9SyiCLn68b094o03.png?height=500&width=500)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/YAynBAQXPJ19i-H4nTq6j.png?height=802&width=610)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ghFj8GtXTJGL-8adf7pCh.png?height=774&width=550)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JfWZzuWXK5wQGo5Pc_aKJ.png?height=722&width=914)\\n\\n## 📚 Past CityDAO Community Roundup articles\\n\\n[https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/](https://chance.ghost.io/citydao-community-roundup-vol-1-so-it-begins/)\\n\\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4](https://city.mirror.xyz/jTi0-xQOMadDgvP_KgMOoHZaYvWJY6D7YK4bcdFz-f4)\\n\\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs](https://city.mirror.xyz/4t6MRC8re_vTuJiVqkKmJTPXBpurzwb1N3v8S6bSJJs)\\n\\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY](https://city.mirror.xyz/1HoGdPHJ4NBmLW_sEun299_QiZTl5WHQAZfa9G8J8NY)\\n\\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/SQW0jsq14kvFmqZKKMQejXr8Gz3QN1HHnBUW2toA6WI](https://city.mirror.xyz/SQW0jsq14kvFmqZKKMQejXr8Gz3QN1HHnBUW2toA6WI)\\n\\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/wB0NbjYfHQjYSw7SU3NwNCrtKR_ECScFRZxHhuSwdjw](https://city.mirror.xyz/wB0NbjYfHQjYSw7SU3NwNCrtKR_ECScFRZxHhuSwdjw)\\n\\n[https://city.mirror.xyz/u_rVIZA7xq1ebmsUrdy953xg7oOF5oZmw7VBulCJgIs](https://city.mirror.xyz/u_rVIZA7xq1ebmsUrdy953xg7oOF5oZmw7VBulCJgIs)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639755379,\"title\":\"CityDAO roundup Vol 8: Wyoming parcel drop incoming\",\"publication\":\"city\"},\"digest\":\"fcnxuP9KgI9NHYbmb0U9sTx2AXRtNhl6U26DqI6Q_GA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x77aA943A365161e499eaFF59E936a799e6051e15\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nJC3Aon0kVt3qehQ-9ia_hlnR8qkotY-Gtn1TRIgwJk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vjMZ4Am7bv0gNw6UpMa7MdAgVXD_UAcS-Lz8nPV9T7U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vooDXgdfumJZSrH7hai17c8c7SEhoXzoQk83XNS2U593mu6t5jkZUGL4xJWm2NtIYVoJ27pexsitGMe71PKuVQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x329c647c0c264c22a3ae71e2ad76f690dd701f85624d20a73e80fe344a6ae7e900c1376e423e00b83aae02ead238a3f239c656ca6be1a5ab5ec354e1f39ad7c01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nJC3Aon0kVt3qehQ-9ia_hlnR8qkotY-Gtn1TRIgwJk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vjMZ4Am7bv0gNw6UpMa7MdAgVXD_UAcS-Lz8nPV9T7U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ynayPtmbuB0awAGdLoMrbEnLtnpcnlYlgneD5zdYyjI\"}"
