"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We’ve finished up the animation rigging for all 7 emotions for our project, which means we can run our final run of trait generation and begin rendering our final product. Even with our mint a week or so out, we need all the time we can get to do this. Roughly each earthling takes 3 minutes to render out which makes about 211 hours of total render time, which is 8 days(!).\\n\\nAs we get closer to mint and really going, let’s talk about what Michael and I think in regards to community, our roadmap, and utility.\\n\\n* We’re not worried about immediately selling out, we've avoided influencers and promoters and are focusing on our project and gaining members of our community that align with our mission\\n* We’ve got amazing artwork that loops. Animated NFTs are the next big thing, look at slim hood, mood rollers and invisible friends.\\n* We want to give back. We're giving a lot back to conservation projects and not trying to send someone to space, or anything like that. We want to do good with our proceeds.\\n* We're going to have merch and with our designer, great looking merch is a no brainer.\\n\\nFurther down the road:\\n\\n* As the community grows and the treasury increases, we’d like to use proceeds to buy land, ideally with a cabin or access to national parks. We envision using the token as a way to not only book time at this cabin on a web3 booking type site, but also to open the doors at the actual cabin during your allotted time.\\n* Collaborating with other projects we work with. While good dev and design is always highly in demand, it’s even more-so sought after in the web3 space. Michael and I are working on other projects that we will plan to have Down 2 Earth members benefit from.\\n* Meet-up/ Hike-ups: Any good community ideally would like to meet up in real life. We do envision meet-ups at more remote locations than other NFT groups, as we hypothesize that many of our holders will be fans of hiking/camping and being outdoors (which is a great thing :D ).\\n* Creating metaverse gear for our holders. We’d love to see our holders walking in the metaverse with the same hats/shoes that their earthling hold.. imagine even if we find a universe that has mountains and lakes, and we have our own virtual fish fry!\\n\\nWe hope this resonates with you when considering our project, and if not that’s okay too, we’re not built for everyone..we’re different.\\n\\nBe down, y’all.\",\"timestamp\":1642096743,\"title\":\"On Being Down 2 Earth\"},\"digest\":\"28teKAfNwB4xvkGdFqFjgnrsHbwF5vhu3AUoie0WFqc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x595170Ff30508f85F94F1C28261f6e624fA72fC5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PEq1qQivouDb_zIST8yLe7pjtvqFfAbI7x4tF-_wBbo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GwbDznar5M8S7zCR0vSe-UDsoKhMfflcH-9WXX9trfc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"OVgHLYl77DNKnKzQC4emiwzDqT6cuuKoS9ry6hQwEq7RfC9VPCGQom8pQwSdb3oj4cDD75h1QD8_1l4YyCNXcA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf7a682f3fb9f90de7cdf100a5c5e0679aa66a9491756764331c9ef357e86f6cf085b5453de561656fccdd0000760bae122004fbb7f5189c401d3977d4c80ed331b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PEq1qQivouDb_zIST8yLe7pjtvqFfAbI7x4tF-_wBbo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GwbDznar5M8S7zCR0vSe-UDsoKhMfflcH-9WXX9trfc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"g2AIxUD_5uhCL6aYmrGrkLaoln39lrHcapV5X9Anxgg\"}"
