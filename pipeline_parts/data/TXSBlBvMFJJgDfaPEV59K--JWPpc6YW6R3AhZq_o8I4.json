"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you have learned to use your Bitcoin wallet safely, then you need to actually do a few transfers to experience firsthand the practical value of Bitcoin. You can only appreciate the value of it if you have actually done it. Even if you don't believe it yourself, you go have to understand why so many people are firmly behind bitcoin. There are countless articles on the internet about the practical value of bitcoin. As a miner, you don't have to really believe that bitcoin has value, but you do have to believe that it has a price. And for something to have a price, the necessary condition is that someone (it doesn't need to be ourselves) wants to pay to get it. So what miners need to know is whether bitcoin really has some special properties that make the diehards want to pay money for it.\\n\\nThe biggest value of bitcoin\\n\\nSatoshi Nakamoto's founding paper refers to Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. In layman's terms, Bitcoin is an open ledger for recording transfers between different addresses. It avoids double-spending (spending a sum of money twice), is decentralized (no centralized issuer), and also provides for a limited total number (21 million) through some clever technical means. All of the above attributes are not the greatest value of Bitcoin, which is fast, borderless, and almost zero-cost transfers.\\n\\nWe all know that the greatest value of the Internet is the fast, borderless, almost zero-cost transfer of information, and that through its rapid development over the past 20 years, the Internet has taken over almost all the information transfer work in the world. Well, we have reason to believe that through 20 years of development, Bitcoin has the promise to take over the vast majority of the world's money transfer work.\\n\\nTo give you a random example of a money transfer: Say you're in Japan and you want to transfer $1,000 to a relative in the U.S. At this point, you have three options: Bitcoin, Paypal, and a traditional wire transfer. If you choose Bitcoin, the transfer will take up to 60 minutes. If you use Paypal, it will cost you about 8% ($80) and the transfer will take at least 1 day. If you use wire transfer, it costs approximately 3.5% ($35) and takes a minimum of 1 day to transfer.\\n\\nThis is the biggest value of Bitcoin, and it's very easy to do. Open your wallet, select the \\\"Send\\\" tab, fill in your address and the amount, click \\\"Send\\\" and you're done. If you don't have anyone to transfer to, you can create two wallets with your own address and transfer them to each other. Anyway, you have to experience it yourself to understand why there are so many bitcoin diehards who are so supportive of bitcoin. From my observations, nine out of ten people who say bitcoin has no value are people who don't even have a bitcoin wallet.\\n\\nWhat determines the price of bitcoin?\\n\\nAs miners, we can certainly not believe in the value of bitcoin either, but we have to believe that there is that small group of people who are convinced that bitcoin has value. This is so that we can sell the bitcoins we get from mining to them at a profit. The next thing we need to consider is since bitcoin has a price, what determines its price?\\n\\nWhy do miners need to know the factors that determine the price? Because miners are the makers and sellers of bitcoins and need to sell them at the highest possible price in order to make a profit. For the price of any commodity, it is the buyer and the seller who determine the price, and the price is not up to one party. However, for two special cases, the above law does not apply. One is a limited number of goods, that is, goods with scarcity, it actually belongs to the seller's market, the price is determined by the seller because once the seller hoarded not to sell, resulting in a situation is that no volume, the price will rise sharply, only the price rose to the seller's satisfaction, the seller will start to sell. The other is an unlimited supply of goods, it actually belongs to the buyer's market, the supply is greater than the demand, for nothing may send the buyer do not want. Bitcoin undoubtedly belongs to the former case, it is a scarce commodity, belongs to the seller's market, that is, the price is determined by the seller, which is why the price of bitcoin has fallen below the cost of few times in its history.\\n\\nAs already stated, bitcoin is a valuable and scarce commodity. If you are a bitcoin diehard and you wish to get it. You can only have two choices, either buy it or mine it. When the price of the coin falls below its cost, miners won't sell the coin because they know there's no third way for you to get it, and you won't mine at this point because mining is obviously a loss, so you're bound to buy it and cause the price of the coin to rise. You might say, well, I just don't buy and spend time with the miners, okay? Sure, but you can't stop other diehards from buying bitcoins, and the result is a pretty high probability that you'll step out of line.\\n\\nSo miners will always be the most sensitive group of people to the price of the coin. If the price of the coin has almost fallen below the cost, shorting is basically a big loss. The reason the price of the coin can't come down is because miners are shy about selling and the die-hards are taking over, and the only ones losing money are the white guys speculating on the coin.\\n\\nIn short, the price of bitcoin has fluctuated dramatically since the day it was born, and it has never stopped. If you are ready to be a miner, then you must have faith in your heart. This faith does not mean that you must believe in Bitcoin, but that you must believe that someone will want Bitcoin. You have to understand that speculation is risky, and miners are even riskier. When the price of the currency falls, speculation can always be cut and leave the market, while miners have almost no way back once they have purchased a miner. So, in order to keep yourself from dumping your hard mined bitcoins at the lowest point, this bit of faith is a must.\",\"timestamp\":1642620219,\"title\":\"The value and price of bitcoin\"},\"digest\":\"5vxanoUrA-OLbz2xrlfJcNMJGUJkNOpf7w571cCyCUU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x038F2777Ce0bACfA8620E60455BBEe6cbe112D66\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CbGG2Wb1LL1KZnDDLxT0LGC2L6bs02pMJ0YRSCKNdkg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vPz9T1cingggTo-YUZ8USwpv7p3Gpzr1Xf9mLiKhpSU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XjakoNfzvk406X263pPaM2r_-Hs7XgBmOXhBrEEL23Y3OgVXEbm9iRwisFUxFeQNMp7g8zRKQG5DSlURYMBltg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0a22e9b5221f27a4cab0a79a8048f42a0f6e4b4aaea48b7754c611be5a444ea72acc70aa665b177346dbd12f03000ebf6daddd6f3bcdaf8644de234ea28b8bbf1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CbGG2Wb1LL1KZnDDLxT0LGC2L6bs02pMJ0YRSCKNdkg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vPz9T1cingggTo-YUZ8USwpv7p3Gpzr1Xf9mLiKhpSU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5vxanoUrA-OLbz2xrlfJcNMJGUJkNOpf7w571cCyCUU\"}"
