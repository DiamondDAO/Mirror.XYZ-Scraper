"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### What if?\\n\\n**What if we lived in a world where another version of you existed? but has made different choices as to not turn out as the version of you you know now or have ever known? would you then despise or chastise a different version of yourself? because the other version of you did not meet the exceptions of the you that you know?or you’re scared of the core values that make both of you,you, are somewhat the same? Are we really afraid of change? or is it just a delusion? because ….someplace somewhere, there is a you but are we really ourselves when another version exists? is your present the weak link of humanity? even if you are, or are not? How do we all become the best versions of ourselves? are we destined to fail as us? or are we getting upgraded every other day? is the whole essence of humanity a test? or just an endless longing for survival? to see the next year, decade? Are we so deluded that we fail to see that even this version of ourselves has flaws? And so do the upgrades.**  \\n\\n**Are we just narcissists living together in our death loop? Are we so afraid of our animalistic behaviors? Do we have to pretend to fit into the norms of today? norms we created for ourselves by ourselves to control, to tame and be put on a leash by society? Who is society? what makes up a society that goes on to make rules and sanctions for immoral acts? What is immoral? what is so immoral about our existence we try so hard to not stray away from?**\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1635329442,\"title\":\"what if?\"},\"digest\":\"mAp8JjyMim7yrrCw2ePJ1rGVfi6AZde65eckEKtnruA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc517D11676cdBA59751CB2544d478de7E6C25a0c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jkzhGj3Rcuw6QiiqXHzTJ9Enzj3508jXFrJ9FcDmGbY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8XFLecuPY-zry-fLtxvYiGLVPf2X3cf2phxeBmQ1tJY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"R2e91e2POgzy38dD1H5EPKdEdxr6gmANjJ0ihAXh_OV_khqZ566IytRDiHgXUw6p0YbE8PQ9-fkMdrq8YIuw2Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x98abe8c3b92b21c4b97add82125a18d6f2d5c688249302eb995938b50116588a6e244dc4f2889878d1f1d6cc4a7f765be6806131b588126939c3126288a928911b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jkzhGj3Rcuw6QiiqXHzTJ9Enzj3508jXFrJ9FcDmGbY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8XFLecuPY-zry-fLtxvYiGLVPf2X3cf2phxeBmQ1tJY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"mAp8JjyMim7yrrCw2ePJ1rGVfi6AZde65eckEKtnruA\"}"
