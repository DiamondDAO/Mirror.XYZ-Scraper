"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Most companies dismiss employees in the following ways.\\n\\n01 Cold violence suppression\\nThis trick is more common, especially for the more senior veteran employees, their wages are high, compensation is also high, often hundreds of thousands of dollars.\\nThe company wants to clear this kind of people away, will use some hidden way.\\nOnce our company training senior manager A is invited to leave by the leadership.\\nDepartment meeting, A speech, the leader interrupted; A proposed leadership does not adopt; A team shortage of people, the leadership does not approve the head.\\nA few months down the wind is not in A, the heart is gone, and moved to take the initiative to look at opportunities outside the mind.\\nLeaders distributed A's resume to familiar headhunters, A has not yet found a good next home, but contact A's headhunters, A naturally think they are in the market \\\"sought-after\\\", and do not want to be aggrieved in the company, they took the initiative to resign.\\n\\n\\n02 find the same level of catfish crowding\\nThe CEO wants the marketing director to be replaced. In order not to spend money, at the same time let the team smooth transition, the CEO first to find a good background and experience are suitable for the deputy director of marketing to join, first let this person familiar with the company environment, team and work content.\\nLet the deputy director be responsible for part of the work, step by step to empty the director.\\nThen the director's resume distributed to headhunters, itself is the heart attack, the director on the one hand, the more dry in the company, the more boring, you can wait for compensation, on the other hand, there are gradually external opportunities, will also actively look at the opportunity, then soon will also take the initiative to leave.\\nCEO will directly promote the deputy director to take office, smooth transition.\\nThe above are real cases.\\n\\n\\n03 Performance improvement\\nThis is the most common way to let ordinary employees leave voluntarily.\\nThere are some people who love to save face, if openly let her into the PIP (Performance Improvement Plan), a little ability of employees will take the initiative to go out to see the opportunity.\\nThe company does not have to carry out transfer training, compensation are also saved.\\n\\n\\n04 Persuade employees to go out and find a job\\nThe company uses this method I think is more flexible and sentimental.\\nTake the initiative to let employees go out to find a job, such as giving employees 2-3 months, do not come to work, social security and provident fund will also pay employees, wages can be issued or not, and employee consultation.\\nFinally reached an agreement, the employee took the initiative to resign, resignation letter above the last working day are negotiated in advance.\\nAnd tell employees, \\\"rest assured that your background checks we will help you so that your career is not tainted.\\\"\\nEmployees will also thank the company, \\\"peaceful breakup\\\" both sides can accept, the staff to go decent, considered the initiative to leave, the company saved compensation. Win-win.\\n\\n05 \\\"disciplinary\\\" after the dismissal\\nThe company can dismiss employees directly without compensation methods are in the employee handbook.\\nThere are some behaviors such as absenteeism, providing false certificates, playing games at work, disobeying superiors and so on.\\nIn fact, if you want to find fault, you can always find. In particular, disobeying the work arranged by superiors is to see how serious the problem is and whether it constitutes a disciplinary offence.\\n\\n\\nOnce the employee is found to have misconduct, the company can propose to dissuade, that is, let you resign voluntarily, because the passive resignation (by the company to kill), the background check will leave a bad record.\\nIn fact, this approach is the most \\\"unethical\\\" (professional).\\nUsually the employee is fooled a little, the employee will actively resign.\\nThe so-called \\\"disciplinary\\\" behavior, are not strictly speaking \\\"disciplinary\\\".\\nBut where you can talk to employees about negotiating the release, or the company persuaded employees to take the initiative to leave the situation, the company does not have the evidence to directly fire the employee.\\nIf the company side of the evidence is sufficient, it is directly dismissed, simply do not have to talk.\\nAfter all, the company belongs to the top, employees in the intense negotiations, basically will compromise the initiative to leave.\\n\\n\\n06 Final elimination\\nThe final elimination is a violation of labor law management, but there are still many companies to take the performance of forced distribution, hidden status elimination method.\\nForced distribution that is, regardless of the overall performance of the team, there must be a certain percentage of employees failing the performance appraisal.\\nThis approach itself is unreasonable, if the team members are excellent, the so-called poor performance of people is not really poor performance, but only relatively speaking, not as good as others.\\nIt is also illegal to directly eliminate these employees. The way to force out is to not get a raise, no promotion, no bonus, and sit on the bench.\\nBe left out for a while, and then the company sent someone to talk about some, also took the initiative to go.\\nThe tactics are similar.\\n\\nWhat about being dismissed?\\nIron camp running water soldiers, there is no position to leave who will not work.\\nSo, no matter how beautiful you are at the moment, be ready to leave.\\nInterviewed by the company.\\nIf you are not at fault, you are interviewed by the company, personal interest in the largest words, you can fight for compensation is 2N, that is, double the compensation, and finally can reach n + 1 / 2 / 3 are also good results.\\nUnless you give you compensation in place, otherwise the company let you sign the document, you refuse to sign. If you do not sign, the company can not be helped.\\nIf you have not served in the company for a long time, the compensation is not much. I prefer to use the 04 method mentioned above with the company and take the initiative to ask to go out and find a job, giving yourself 2-3 months.\\n\\n\\nThis approach, in the past consulting cases, is still more effective.\\nYou can also take the initiative to ask for a pay cut for a new job, to buy time, if you are lucky, want to force you to leave the supervisor, may be the first to \\\"kill\\\".\\nNot being interviewed.\\n\\n\\nIf the company in some way forced back, and no one to talk to you, you can take action is to see outside opportunities as soon as possible, can find a new job and then take the initiative to resign.\\n\\n\\nNo savings, no ability, do not resign naked.\",\"timestamp\":1636368177,\"title\":\"Six ways for companies to dismiss employees\"},\"digest\":\"cHWUPOqKZRlHBTjvH02oqTOU-kMzTo1cSeAIyj_qjRU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x078Ad5270b0240D8529f600f35A271Fc6E2b2bD8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GSGydP_1pUC4UjDCwGFcMxRG2uMIRO1phBcgHavjzLc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qlo83rdUXvHaNDjY11bzHaC2nvOn-9wFWZJ0UoL0U7o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"u_Xdh_TyTvH2pLGDhVoSISqFCEIVNXc3h-1UnKoge81fCTyzPYdXEGnfkLdlLJxF3vboO5QMH1e4dFF7NU3MKQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x08abffa360d575a7de52ef80c18021c998f521f851156354ee148fd31ca41ecb117e264097595aa141a8b10a4fa3bc6aeccf1c4846ff71c789367f9ee994763c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"GSGydP_1pUC4UjDCwGFcMxRG2uMIRO1phBcgHavjzLc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qlo83rdUXvHaNDjY11bzHaC2nvOn-9wFWZJ0UoL0U7o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cHWUPOqKZRlHBTjvH02oqTOU-kMzTo1cSeAIyj_qjRU\"}"
