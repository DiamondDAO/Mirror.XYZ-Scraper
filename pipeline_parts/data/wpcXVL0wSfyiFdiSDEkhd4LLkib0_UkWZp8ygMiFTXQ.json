[ + apply here + ](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-UNI-Grants-6e3e84967a984a5fb127ae749649ddc9)\\n\\ni've worked on [design & animation](https://vimeo.com/chrismartz) projects for tv, film, tech and now do a mix of freelance web3 work, design and research\\n\\ni have recently experimented making NFTs on [Zora](https://martz.mirror.xyz/IuJ1MpoYggEK1XkyLTuEsHpHMQaYjK0EERlQhUYT2W0), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/martz) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/chrismartz)\\n\\n [NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/26184)\\n\\n\\n\\ni also hang out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chrismartz)  and sometimes on discord in [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/)\\n\\ni recently applied for a [Uniswap grant](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d) and somehow they liked my proposal\\n\\nshoutout to [FWB](https://fwb.help/Manifesto) #rough-drafts channel\\n\\n[Jose Mejia](https://twitter.com/JoseRMejia), [Panther Modern](https://twitter.com/panthermodern__) and [Callil Capuozzo](https://twitter.com/_callil) for guidance and feedback on the process\\n\\nshoutout to [Ken Ng](https://twitter.com/nkennethk) from [Uniswap Grants](https://twitter.com/uniswapgrants)\\n\\n[Apply Here](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-UNI-Grants-6e3e84967a984a5fb127ae749649ddc9) ü¶Ñ üí´\\n\\nthe grant's focus is on usability - [my work is shared here](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d&p=213865888ed34c1092ffe0062a7eea47) \\n\\n- in the short term this means [improving documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/) + creating more resources for learning Uniswap via design, illustration and animation\\n\\n- in the long term this could mean creating new spaces and things that welcome even more (+ more diverse) people to this \\\"new space\\\"\\n\\n\\nthis \\\"new space\\\" meaning:  Web3, crypto, DAOS, DeFi and NFTs\\n\\ni am talking to [jon-kyle](https://www.jon-kyle.com/) and [callil](https://callil.com/) about one of these projects now:\\n\\n\\n> - soft launch a mirror.xyz community publishing channel for Uniswap on mirror\\n\\n> - create a place for community members to get a spotlight and get paid for their creative works\\n\\n> - make governance fun and interesting\\n\\nright now, much of this process is active research but we will be building prototypes soon, here is very rough mockup\\n\\nUniversal Editions / Clout Universe / Name TBD\\n\\n---\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bd350e7-0f5a-4d52-9319-1a3f28ae5172.png?height=1566&width=1096)\\n\\n---\\n\\nthe concept is that curators get to vote in a [write race](https://mirror.xyz/race) type format but for \\\"content\\\" that is more open to the public - perhaps in a reduced feature, blog style post editor?\\n\\nit would be very cool to have teams work to create these and be able to use [splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) to divide up the bounty\\n\\nit would be equally cool if this sort of module could become a community hub / blog for uniswap - then, if successful, other ecosystems with treasuries could use it to increase awareness and participation for [on-chain governance](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/onchain-governance.asp#:~:text=On%2Dchain%20governance%20is%20a,or%20reject%20the%20proposed%20change.)\\n\\nas a designer and a researcher i've noticed a lot of un-allocated funds in this space, i think a good spend of those would be more experiments to reach people who may not understand the basics, or may be scared to explore a realm that feels \\\"sketchy\\\" to them.\\n\\nif you like this idea, or have any feedback (or have a good name for the publication thing) -
