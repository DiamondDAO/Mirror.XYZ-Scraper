"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"*Co-authored with [Kinjal Shah](https://twitter.com/_kinjalbshah)*\\n\\nWe’ve entered a new chapter of investing.\\n\\nOne where trading is social, and banking profits is an MMORPG game.\\n\\nLook at DOGE, SHIB or GME and it’s easy to see this chapter as nothing more than a game of roulette.\\n\\nHowever, within the midst of these experiments is the rise of something far more promising - **micro-economies**.\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/mewn21/status/1390118496722309125?s=20)\\n\\nBy intertwining financial assets with social capital, we’re now witnessing a new type of asset class dominated by online community coordination.\\n\\nThis is the rise of micro-economies.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/71ac7dfe-c19b-425c-976e-ff8f7170f8ae.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\\n\\nIn this post, we’ll make the case for a creator middle class, how it captures value, and why crypto primitives set the stage for the renaissance of micro-economies.\\n\\nLet’s dive in.\\n\\n## What are Micro-economies?\\n\\nMicro-economies are communities:\\n\\n- With a total market cap of less than $1,000,000\\n- With under 100 active members.\\n- Working for sweat equity\\n- That lack legal incorporation (LLC, corp, etc.)\\n\\nMicro-economies have a shared mission, are pre-product and have little to no revenue. They’re in the earliest stages of hiring and resemble structures like co-ops or committees. \\n\\nEarly contributors carve out their own roles and compensations - loosely resembling [Teal organizations](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/) in which every member defines their scope and value to the group.\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/owocki/status/1390357136815779845?s=20)\\n\\nThanks to the advent of social tokens and DAOs, communities now have the ability to create shared financial resources.\\n\\nA DAO provides open access and a vehicle representing ownership. Think of this as a community bank. More times than not, that community will have a shared currency representing ownership of that bank - i.e., a social token.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/ljxie/status/1370459278407049223?s=20\\n\\nAll together, this foundation creates a unique position for a new business class to emerge.\\n\\n## Enter the Creator Middle Class\\n\\nThe [creator middle class](https://hbr.org/2020/12/the-creator-economy-needs-a-middle-class) are future mom and pop shops. For the past three decades, the internet enabled thousands of communities to emerge. But, the primary beneficiaries continue to be the top 1% while [~97% of YouTube creators](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/02/27/youtube-top-creators-revenue/) make less than the national poverty line.\\n\\nNiche communities are what make the internet a vibrant and open ecosystem. Within online communities, creators are evolving into SMBs, designed to activate their [1000](https://a16z.com/2021/02/27/nfts-and-a-thousand-true-fans/) or even [100 true fans](https://a16z.com/2020/02/06/100-true-fans/).\\n\\nNow the real question becomes - *how do we make the long tail of creators a viable path?*\\n\\n**In order for a niche community to become a meaningful business, they need to earn income and capture value.**\\n\\n## Tooling for Micro-Economies\\n\\nCreator tools enable micro-economies. The shift from Web2 to Web3 create revenue streams which prioritize community ownership over individual ownership. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b1b1d3dc-e3e3-46de-9882-a9b3b23d7971.jpeg?height=1440&width=2560)\\n\\nIn Web2, creators monetize their work via a SaaS model, where they’re paid for a newsletter, artwork, or craft on a regular basis. \\n\\nIn Web3, creators monetize through the issuance of a social token or NFTs, with non-fungible tokens acting as digital media ownership. \\n\\nTokenization offers a path to crowdfund work, while also ensuring early supporters are rewarded. It prioritizes community ownership, best seen in early Mirror campaigns like [$VALUE](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/b3_zJsOv8vvvJsaOKyCM-KcCeA_zEbn6K1yrmnRSK8Q) and [$ESSAY](https://j.mirror.xyz/uVGCCwwm3k341lPpxaJmHTZROESVse9Pe_rmbiuUAC0).\\n\\nMonetization becomes non-linear, meaning the derivative value of tokens are often multiples of the value created from recurring revenue streams.\\n\\nThese tools offer a direct way for communities to earn income, while also providing mediums to share (and multiply) the value with its members.\\n\\n**While Web2 is passive, web3 makes it active, thus turning communities into functioning micro-economies. **\\n\\n## Why Should I Care?\\n\\nMicro-economies give the long-tail of creators a path forward. \\n\\nThanks to platforms like [Coinvise](https://www.coinvise.co/) and [Rally](https://rally.io/), micro-economies can be created in an instant. They allow creators to distribute liquid instruments (in the form of tokens) to better monetize intangible contributions and sweat equity. \\n\\nTo contributors, it offers an unconventional path to work on what you love, and get paid in assets with exponential upside in the process.\\n\\nAdoption will not happen through gambling, it will happen through 100,000 niche communities teaching ten of their closest friends how crypto can make a fundamental difference in their social life today.\\n\\n## Key Players\\n\\nThe most prominent micro-economies are seen with young guns like [Anish Agnihotri](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri) - spending nights and weekends outside a degree and working full time at Polychain to build communities like PartyDAO using Mirror and Zora. Nice work, boss!\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/_anishagnihotri/status/1389793340057694213?s=20)\\n\\n[Seed Club](https://twitter.com/seedclubhq), [Six](https://twitter.com/sixnft) and CRE8 Club are building systems to manage the next generation of micro-economies - offering best practices to take creators from 0 to 1.\\n\\nCrypto-media outlets like Bankless are now [transitioning to a DAO](https://medium.com/bankless-dao/announcing-bankless-dao-133220f5efd8). This comes alongside [Forefront](https://forefront.news/blog/ff-community-incentives), and [Global Coin Research](https://globalcoinresearch.com/how-to-submit-contributor-posts/) who are all incentivizing writing contributions using their native tokens! (plus more coming SoonTM)\\n\\n[](https://twitter.com/Iiterature/status/1390724377227022339?s=20)\\n\\n[PleasrDAO](https://twitter.com/PleasrDAO), [SongCamp](https://twitter.com/songcampdotband), [SquiggleDAO](https://twitter.com/squiggledao), Gremlins and [CypherDAO](https://twitter.com/cypherdao) are all starting to collect together. While most micro-economies won’t have [$5M to purchase Edward Snowden’s first NFT](https://foundation.app/Snowden/stay-free-edward-snowden-2021-24437), it’s exciting to highlight the power of what’s possible when resources are shared to follow an agreed upon mission.\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/sirsuhayb/status/1389040288006512643?s=20\\n\\n## How Micro-Economies Evolve\\n\\nAs micro-economies find their footing, it’s common to see the community band together to scale.\\n\\nThis is done through Treasury Diversification - a way to exchange tokens directly from the treasury with capital contributors keen to purchase sizable stakes in the group. Not only does it provide a community with working capital, but it gives the token more confidence as it’s now socially backed by world-class investors.\\n\\nCommunities like [Friends With Benefits](https://snapshot.org/#/friendswithbenefits.eth/proposal/QmesG4qENC7CtAQRi5KAQbKucqRjPqGh8nJx4aR2G6mran), [Badger](https://forum.badger.finance/t/bip-37-treasury-diversification-through-strategic-partnerships/3262), [Lido](https://research.lido.fi/t/proposal-ldo-treasury-diversification-part-2/506) and [Index Co-op](https://gov.indexcoop.com/t/iip-32-index-sale/1214) all successfully executed Treasury Diversification proposals.\\n\\nOnce working capital is available, we start to see a migration from [token-only compensation](https://magnethq.io/) to more standard payment structures and roles akin to traditional companies. This hybrid mix between a community token and USDC rivals Silicon Valley compensation packages with the added benefit of tokenized equity being liquid by default, tradable 24/7 on global DEXs like Uniswap. \\n\\nThis flow allows revenue generation to have a more direct tie to contributors. As micro-economies earn income, they’re incentivized to route it through a community treasury as token price *should* increase as a multiple of the growth of the treasury.\\n\\nTools like [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/) and [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/docs) allow micro-economies to better rank contributions - ultimately building towards organizations in which compensation is tied to value created, rather than time spent.\\n\\nThanks to projects like [Parcel](https://beta-mainnet.parcel.money/dashboard), it’s never been easier to track, distribute and account for payments to and from a community treasury.\\n\\n**Put together, crypto offers the foundation for a sustainable creator middle class.**\\n\\n## Get Involved\\n\\nThis post is an open call to those building micro-economies.\\n\\nIt’s evident that a creator middle class is emerging, and that there is now a clear path to create and capture value. While the tools exist, it’s up to us to write the playbook for the next million micro-economies.\\n\\nIf you’re working on micro-economies and are interested in sharing your ideas, please [reach out](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa).\\n\\nTogether, we’ll build the creator middle class into a force to be reckoned with.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to Li Jin for the feedback and to Carlos Gomes for the graphics!\\n\\n*If you liked this post, be sure to leave a tip.
