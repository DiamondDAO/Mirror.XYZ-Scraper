Indeed, they are the basis of the very oxygen that we breathe every day,\\\" he said. \\\"Yet, that great public benefit that the African ecosystem provides to the world has not yet been fully acknowledged.\\\"\\n\\nKenyatta appreciated that investors, consumers and shareholders are beginning to demand companies start the process of decarbonizing their activities and moving toward a carbon neutral world.\\n\\n**The Giants Club**\\n\\nHe said Kenya plans to work with African countries from the Giants Club conservation group to raise investment resources in the continent's climate change programs. The Giants Club is a group of African nations, including Kenya, Uganda and Mozambique, partnering in wildlife conservation activities.\\n\\nEvgeny Lebedev, founder of Lebedev Holdings which co-hosted the event, said the rainforest in the Congo River Basin is one of the strongest remaining defenses against climate change.\\n\\n\\\"Unlike other large tropical rainforests, Congo remains a strong net carbon sink,\\\" he said. \\\"Currently, it removes 4 percent of the planet's annual carbon emissions. These sprawling landscapes are nature's very own carbon removal devices, absorbing it and sequestering it away.\\\"\\n\\nMax Graham, founder and CEO of conservation organization Space for Giants, said the $100 billion that developed countries promised to developing countries sounds like a lot of money, but it is not when compared to the things that people are spending money on.\\n\\n\\\"The world spends $623 billion every year on beer. America alone spends $53 billion annually on pets. We collectively spend $90 billion on our hair, $57 billion on ice-cream and over $100 billion on coffee,\\\" he said. \\\"If we collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on items that are not essential for our survival, it seems completely inexplicable that we are not paying for the price of something we need for our children's future.\\\"\\n\\nAkinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank, said while carbon offset is important for reaching net-zero, the most critical thing is proper pricing of carbon.\",\"timestamp\":1636675156,\"title\":\"Africa battles to restore carbon sinks\"},\"digest\":\"m7oMoIhEV1QwLghX1tmwxYwoFCIh3FzpTVk9nKiojjs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6edd17976B52A22aA4E9BACAdBd59e5EB54a79C2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d66Ty8rZ-6jUChphz3STVD2eQwXyK2gTRfi5ovc3Uxk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8VZf1rtVY2DnxgAR111cMHTcQ5_hWixnUM_nxb790w0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bDQoC2hUs2FXFpJ8AooagP9Tq9_MgP9nse9d6nrgxGd6j74HdrDuafOSh6E_1uWnfIRb8o_Z0feX6gzD5arjCA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe50c864d635c8d7ddbae49904757c702b1fe48406e7c833465173d5ff7bf88d16f39fbb7abd61be471f1d8469d4143bfd7f504f1777615afbc1c65ddb5011cd61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"d66Ty8rZ-6jUChphz3STVD2eQwXyK2gTRfi5ovc3Uxk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8VZf1rtVY2DnxgAR111cMHTcQ5_hWixnUM_nxb790w0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m7oMoIhEV1QwLghX1tmwxYwoFCIh3FzpTVk9nKiojjs\"}"
