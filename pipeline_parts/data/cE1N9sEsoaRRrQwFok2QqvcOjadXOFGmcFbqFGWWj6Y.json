"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He had even then discussed with his Cabinet an announcement favoring general emancipation.  The time did not seem to them ripe.  It was decided to wait until a Federal victory should save the announcement from appearing to be a cry of desperation.  Antietam, which the North interpreted as a victory, gave Lincoln his opportunity.\\n\\nThe Emancipation Proclamation applied only to the States in arms against the Federal Government.  Such States were given three months in which to return to the Union.  Thereafter, if they did not return, their slaves would be regarded by that Government as free.  No distinction was made between slaves owned by supporters of the Confederacy and those whose owners were in opposition to it.  The Proclamation had no bearing on those slave States which had not seceded.  Needless to add, no seceded State returned, and a second Proclamation making their slaves theoretically free was in due time issued on the first of January, 1863.\\n\\nIt must not be forgotten that this radical change of policy was made in September, 1862.  We have already heard of the elections which took place soon after--those elections which mark perhaps the lowest ebb of Lincoln's popularity, when Seymour was elected Governor of New York, and the peace party gained over thirty seats in Congress.  It is a question whether, as a purely domestic measure, the Emancipation Proclamation was not, for the time, an injury to the Lincoln Government.  And yet it was the real turningpoint in the fortunes of the North.  It was the central fact in the maintenance of the blockade.\\n\\nIn England at this time the cotton famine was at its height. Nearly a million people in the manufacturing districts were wholly dependent upon charity.  This result of the blockade had been foreseen by the Confederate Government which was confident that the distress of England's working people would compel the English ministry to intervene and break the blockade.  The employers in England whose loss was wholly financial, did as the Confederates hoped they would do.  The workmen, however, took a different course.  Schooled by a number of able debaters, they fell into line with that third group of political leaders who saw in the victory of the North, whatever its motives, the eventual extinction of slavery.  To these people, the Emancipation Proclamation gave a definite programme.  It was now, the leaders argued, no longer a question of eventual effect; the North had proclaimed a motive and that motive was the extinction of slavery. Great numbers of Englishmen of all classes who had hitherto held back from supporting Cobden and Bright now ranged themselves on their side.  Addresses of praise and sympathy \\\"began to pour into the Legation of the United States in a steady and ever swelling stream.\\\"  An immense popular demonstration took place at Exeter Hall.  Cobden, writing to Sumner, described the new situation in British politics, in a letter amounting to an assurance that the Government never again would attempt to resist the popular pressure in favor of the North.\\n\\nOn the last day of 1862 a meeting of workingmen at Manchester, where the cotton famine was causing untold misery, adopted one of those New Year greetings to Lincoln.  Lincoln's reply expressed with his usual directness his own view of the sympathetic relation that had been established between the democratic classes of the two countries:\\n\\n\\\"I know and deeply deplore the sufferings which the workingmen at Manchester, and in all Europe, are called to endure in this crisis. It has been often and studiously represented that the attempt to overthrow this Government, which was built upon the foundation of human rights, and to substitute for it one which should rest exclusively on the basis of human slavery, was likely to obtain the favor of Europe.  Through the action of our disloyal citizens, the workingmen of Europe have been subjected to severe trials, for the purpose of forcing their sanction to that attempt.  Under the circumstances, I cannot but regard your decisive utterances upon the question as an instance of sublime Christian heroism which has not been surpassed in any age or in any country.  It is indeed an energetic and reinspiring assurance of the inherent power of truth, and of the ultimate triumph of justice, humanity, and freedom.  I do not doubt that the sentiments you have expressed will be sustained by your great nation; and, on the other hand, I have no hesitation in assuring you that they will excite admiration, esteem, and the most reciprocal feelings of friendship among the American people.  I hail this interchange of sentiment, therefore, as an augury that whatever else may happen, whatever misfortune may befall your country or my own, the peace and friendship which now exists between the two nations will be, as it shall be my desire to make them, perpetual.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER X. THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\\n\\nThough the defeat of the Democrats at the polls in 1863 and the now definitely friendly attitude of England had done much to secure the stability of the Lincoln Government, this success was due in part to a figure which now comes to the front and deserves attentive consideration.  Indeed the work of Salmon Portland Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, forms a bridge, as one might say, between the first and second phases of Lincoln's administration.\\n\\nThe interesting Englishman who is the latest biographer of Lincoln says of Chase: \\\"Unfortunately, this imposing person was a sneak.\\\" But is Lord Charnwood justified in that surprising characterization?  He finds support in the testimony of Secretary Welles, who calls Chase, \\\"artful dodger, unstable, and unreliable.\\\" And yet there is another side, for it is the conventional thing in America to call him our greatest finance minister since Hamilton, and even a conspicuous enemy said of him, at a crucial moment, that his course established his character \\\"as an honest and frank man.\\\"\\n\\nTaking these contradictory estimates as hints of a contradiction in the man, we are forced to the conclusion that Chase was a professional in politics and an amateur in finance.  Perhaps herein is the whole explanation of the two characteristics of his financial policy--his reluctance to lay taxes, and his faith in loans.  His two eyes did not see things alike.  One was really trying to make out the orthodox path of finance; the other was peering along the more devious road of popular caprice.\\n\\nThe opening of the war caught the Treasury, as it caught all branches of the Government, utterly unprepared.  Between April and July, 1861, Chase had to borrow what he could.  When Congress met in July, his real career as director of financial policy began--or, as his enemies think, failed to begin.  At least, he failed to urge upon Congress the need of new taxes and appeared satisfied with himself asking for an issue of $240,000,000 in bonds bearing not less than seven per cent interest.  Congress voted to give him $250,000,000 of which $50,000,000 might be interest-bearing treasury notes; made slight increases in duties; and Prepared for excise and direct taxation the following year.  Later in the year Congress laid a three per cent tax on all incomes in excess of $800.\\n\\nWhen Congress reassembled in December, 1861, expenditures were racing ahead of receipts, and there was a deficit of $143,000,000. It must not be forgotten that this month was a time of intense excitability and of nervous reaction.  Fremont had lately been removed, and the attack on Cameron had begun.  At this crucial moment the situation was made still more alarming by the action of the New York banks, followed by all other banks, in suspending specie payments.  They laid the responsibility upon Chase.  A syndicate of banks in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia had come to the aid of the Government, but when they took up government bonds, Chase had required them to pay the full value cash down, though they had asked permission to hold the money on deposit and to pay it as needed on requisition by the Government.  Furthermore, in spite of their protest, Chase issued treasury notes, which the banks had to receive from their depositors, who nevertheless continued to demand specie.  On January 1, 1862, the banks owed $459,000,000 and had in specie only $87,000,000.  Chase defended his course by saying that the financial crisis was not due to his policy--or lack of policy, as it would now seem--but to a general loss of faith in the outcome of the war.\\n\\nThere now arose a moral crisis for this \\\"imposing person\\\" who was Secretary of the Treasury--a crisis with regard to which there are still differences of opinion.  While he faced his problem silently, the Committee on Ways and Means in the House took the matter in hand: Its solution was an old one which all sound theorists on finance unite in condemning--the issue of irredeemable paper money. And what did the Secretary of the Treasury do?  Previously, as Governor of Ohio, he had denounced paper money as, in effect, a fraud upon society.  Long after, when the tide of fortune had landed him in the high place of Supreme Justice, he returned to this view and condemned as unconstitutional the law of 1862 establishing a system of paper money.  But at the time when that law was passed Chase, though he went through the form of protesting, soon acquiesced.  Before long he was asking Congress to allow a further issue of what he had previously called \\\"fraudulent\\\" money.\\n\\nThe answer to the question whether Chase should have stuck to his principles and resigned rather than acquiesce in the paper money legislation turns on that other question--how were the politician and the financier related in his make-up?\\n\\nBefore Congress and the Secretary had finished, $450,000,000 were issued.  Prices naturally rose, and there was speculation in gold. Even before the first issue of paper money, the treasury notes had been slightly below par.  In January, 1863, a hundred dollars in paper would bring, in New York, only $69.00 in gold; a year later, after falling, rising, and falling again, the value was $64.00; in July and August, 1864, it was at its lowest, $39.00; when the war closed, it had risen to $67.00.  There was powerful protest against the legislation responsible for such a condition of affairs.  Justin Morrill, the author of the Morrill tariff, said, \\\"I would as soon provide Chinese wooden guns for the army as paper money alone for the army.  It will be a breach of public faith. It will injure creditors; it will increase prices; it will increase many fold the cost of the war.\\\"  Recent students agree, in the main, that his prophecies were fulfilled; and a common estimate of the probable increase in the cost of the war through the use of paper money and the consequent inflation of prices is $600,000,000.\\n\\nThere was much more financial legislation in 1862; but Chase continued to stand aside and allow Congress the lead in establishing an excise law, an increase in the income tax, and a higher tariff--the last of which was necessitated by the excise law which has been described as a bill \\\"that taxed everything.\\\" To enable American manufacturers to bear the excise duties levied upon their business, protection was evoked to secure them the possession of their field by excluding foreign competition.  All these taxes, however, produced but a fraction of the Government's revenue.  Borrowing, the favorite method of the Secretary, was accepted by Congress as the main resource.  It is computed that by means of taxation there was raised in the course of the war $667,163,247.00, while during the same period the Government borrowed $2,621,916,786.00.\\n\\nWhatever else he may think of Chase, no one denies that in 1862 he had other interests besides finance.  Lincoln's Cabinet in those days was far from an harmonious body.  All through its history there was a Chase faction and a Seward faction.  The former had behind them the Radical Republicans, while the latter relied upon the support of the moderates.  This division in the Republican party runs deep through the politics of the time.  There seems to be good reason to think that Chase was not taken by surprise when his radical allies in Congress, in December, 1862, demanded of Lincoln the removal of Seward.  It will be remembered that the elections of the autumn of 1862 had gone against Lincoln.  At this moment of dismay, the friends of Chase struck their blow.  Seward instantly offered his resignation.  But Lincoln skillfully temporized.  Thereupon, Chase also resigned.  Judging from the scanty evidence we have of his intention, we may conclude that he thought he had Lincoln in a corner and that he expected either to become first minister or the avowed chief of an irresistible opposition.  But he seems to have gone too fast for his followers. Lincoln had met them, together with his Cabinet, in a conference in December, 1862, and frankly discussed the situation, with the result that some of them wavered.  When Lincoln informed both Seward and Chase that he declined to accept their resignations, both returned--Seward with alacrity, Chase with reluctance.  One of the clues to Lincoln's cabinet policy was his determination to keep both these factions committed to the Government, without allowing himself to be under the thumb of either.\\n\\nDuring the six months following the cabinet crisis Chase appears at his best.  A stupendous difficulty lay before him and he attacked it manfully.  The Government's deficit was $276,900,000. Of the loans authorized in 1862--the \\\"five-twenties\\\" as they were called, bringing six per cent and to run from five to twenty years at the Government's pleasure---the sales had brought in, to December, 1862, only $23,750,000, though five hundred million had been expected.  The banks in declining to handle these bonds laid the blame on the Secretary, who had insisted that all purchasers should take them at par.\\n\\nIt is not feasible, in a work of this character, to enter into the complexities of the financial situation of 1863, or to determine just what influences caused a revolution in the market for government bonds.  But two factors must be mentioned.  Chase was induced to change his attitude and to sell to banks large numbers of bonds at a rate below par, thus enabling the banks to dispose of them at a profit.  He also called to his aid Jay Cooke, an experienced banker, who was allowed a commission of one-half per cent on all bonds sold up to $10,000,000 and three-eighths of one per cent after that.  Cooke organized a countrywide agency system, with twenty-five hundred subagents through whom he offered directly to the people bonds in small denominations.  By all manner of devices, patriotism and the purchase of bonds were made to appear the same thing, and before the end of the year $400,000,000 in five-twenty bonds had been sold.  This campaign to dispose of the five-twenties was the turning-point in war finance, and later borrowings encountered no such difficulties as those of 1862 and 1863.\\n\\nBetter known today than this precarious legislation is the famous Act of 1863, which was amended in the next year and which forms the basis of our present system of national banks.  To Chase himself the credit for this seems to be due.  Even in 1861 he advised Congress to establish a system of national banks, and he repeated the advice before it was finally taken.  The central feature of this system which he advocated is one with which we are still familiar: permission to the banks accepting government supervision to deposit government bonds in the Treasury and to acquire in return the right to issue bank-notes to the amount of ninety per cent of the value of the bonds.\\n\\nThere can be no doubt that Chase himself rated very highly his own services to his country.  Nor is there any doubt that, alone among Lincoln's close associates, he continued until the end to believe himself a better man than the President.  He and his radical following made no change in their attitude to Lincoln, though Chase pursued a course of confidential criticism which has since inspired the characterization of him as a \\\"sneak,\\\" while his followers were more outspoken.  In the summer of 1863 Chase was seriously talked of as the next President, and before the end of the year Chase clubs were being organized in all the large cities to promote his candidacy.  Chase himself took the adroit position of not believing that any President should serve a second term.\\n\\nEarly in 1864 the Chase organization sent out a confidential circular signed by Senator Pomeroy of Kansas setting forth the case against Lincoln as a candidate and the case in favor of Chase. Unfortunately for Chase, this circular fell into the hands of a newspaper and was published.  Chase at once wrote to Lincoln denying any knowledge of the circular but admitting his candidacy and offering his resignation.  No more remarkable letter was written by Lincoln than his reply to Chase, in which he showed that he had long fully understood the situation, and which he closed with these words: \\\"Whether you shall remain at the head of the Treasury Department is a question which I do not allow myself to consider from any standpoint other than my judgment of the public service, and, in that view, I do not perceive occasion for change.\\\"\\n\\nThe Chase boom rapidly declined.  The deathblow was given by a caucus of the Union members of the legislature of his own State nominating Lincoln \\\"at the demand of the people and the soldiers of Ohio.\\\"  The defeat embittered Chase.  For several months, however, he continued in the Cabinet, and during this time he had the mortification of seeing Lincoln renominated in the National Union Convention amid a great display of enthusiasm.\\n\\nMore than once in the past, Chase had offered his resignation.  On one occasion Lincoln had gone to his house and had begged him to reconsider his decision.  Soon after the renomination, Chase again offered his resignation upon the pretext of a disagreement with the President over appointments to office.  This time, however, Lincoln felt the end had come and accepted the resignation. Chase's successor in the Treasury was William Pitt Fessenden, Senator from Maine.  During most of the summer of 1864 Chase stood aside, sullen and envious, watching the progress of Lincoln toward a second election.  So much did his bitterness affect his judgment that he was capable of writing in his diary his belief that Lincoln meant to reverse his policy and consent to peace with slavery reestablished.\\n\\nCHAPTER XI. NORTHERN LIFE DURING THE WAR\\n\\nThe real effects of war on the life of nations is one of those old and complicated debates which lie outside the scope of a volume such as this.  Yet in the particular case of the Northern people it is imperative to answer two questions both of which have provoked interminable discussion: Was the moral life of the North good or bad in the war years?  Was its commercial life sound?\\n\\nAs to the moral question, contemporary evidence seems at first sight contradictory.  The very able Englishman who represented the \\\"Times\\\", William H. Russell, gives this ugly picture of an American city in 1863:\\n\\n\\\"Every fresh bulletin from the battlefield of Chickamauga, during my three weeks' stay in Cincinnati, brought a long list of the dead and wounded of the Western army, many of whom, of the officers, belonged to the best families of the place.  Yet the signs of mourning were hardly anywhere perceptible; the noisy gaiety of the town was not abated one jot.\\\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, a private manuscript of a Cincinnati family describes the \\\"intense gloom hanging over the city like a pall\\\" during the period of that dreadful battle.  The memories of old people at Cincinnati in after days--if they had belonged to the \\\"loyal\\\" party--contained only sad impressions of a city that was one great hospital where \\\"all our best people\\\" worked passionately as volunteer assistants of the government medical corps.\\n\\nA third fact to be borne in mind in connection with this apparent contradiction in evidence is the source of the greater fortunes of Cincinnati, a large proportion of which are to be traced, directly or indirectly to government contracts during the war.  In some cases the merciless indifference of the Cincinnati speculators to the troubles of their country are a local scandal to this day, and it is still told, sometimes with scorn, sometimes with amusement, how perhaps the greatest of these fortunes was made by forcing up the price of iron at a time when the Government had to have iron, cost what it might.\\n\\nThus we no sooner take up the moral problem of the times than we find ourselves involved in the commercial question, for here, as always, morals and business are intertwined. Was the commercial management of the North creditable to the Government and an honor to the people?  The surest way to answer such questions is to trace out with some fullness the commercial and industrial conditions of the North during the four years of war.\\n\\nThe general reader who looks for the first time into the matter is likely to be staggered by what statistics seem to say.  Apparently they contradict what he is accustomed to hear from popular economists about the waste of war.  He has been told in the newspapers that business is undermined by the withdrawal of great numbers of men from \\\"productive\\\" consumption of the fruits of labor and their engagement as soldiers in \\\"unproductive\\\" consumption.  But, to his astonishment, he finds that the statistics of 1861-1865 show much increase in Northern business --as, for example, in 1865, the production of 142 million pounds of wool against 60 million in 1860.  The government reports show that 13 million tons of coal were mined in 1860 and 21 million in 1864; in 1860, the output of pig iron was 821,000 tons, and 1,014,282 tons in 1864; the petroleum production rose from 21 million gallons in 1860 to 128 million in 1862; the export of corn, measured in money, shows for 1860 a business of $2,399,808 compared with $10,592,704 for 1863; wheat exporting showed, also, an enormous increase, rising from 14 millions in 1860 to 46 millions in 1863.  There are, to be sure, many statistics which seem to contradict these.  Some of them will be mentioned presently.  And yet, on the whole, it seems safe to conclude that the North, at the close of the third year of war was producing more and was receiving larger profits than in 1860.\\n\\nTo deal with this subject in its entirety would lead us into the labyrinths of complex economic theory, yet two or three simple facts appear so plain that even the mere historian may venture to set them forth.  When we look into the statistics which seem to show a general increase of business during the war, we find that in point of fact this increase was highly specialized.  All those industries that dealt with the physical necessities of life and all those that dealt peculiarly with armies flourished amazingly. And yet there is another side to the story, for there were other industries that were set back and some that almost, if not entirely, disappeared.  A good instance is the manufacture of cotton cloth.  When the war opened, 200,000 hands were employed in this manufacture in New England.  With the sealing up of the South and the failure of the cotton supply, their work temporarily ceased.  What became of the workmen?  Briefly, one of three things happened: some went into other trades, such as munitions, in which the war had created an abnormal demand for labor; a great number of them became soldiers; and many of them went West and became farmers or miners.  Furthermore, many whose trades were not injured by the war left their jobs and fled westward to escape conscription.  Their places were left open to be filled by operatives from the injured trades. In one or another of these ways the laborer who was thrown out of work was generally able to recover employment.  But it is important to remember that the key to the labor situation at that time was the vast area of unoccupied land which could be had for nothing or next to nothing.  This fact is brought home by a comparison of the situation of the American with that of the English workman during the cotton famine.  According to its own ideas England was then fully cultivated.  There was no body of land waiting to be thrown open, as an emergency device, to a host of new-made agriculturists.  When the cotton-mills stopped at Manchester, their operatives had practically no openings but in other industrial occupations.  As such opportunities were lacking, they became objects of charity until they could resume their work. As a country with a great reserve of unoccupied land, the United States was singularly fortunate at this economic crisis.\\n\\nOne of the noteworthy features of Northern life during the war is that there was no abnormal increase in pauperism.  A great deal has been written upon the extensive charities of the time, but the term is wrongly applied, for what is really referred to is the volunteer aid given to the Government in supporting the armies. This was done on a vast scale, by all classes of the population--that is, by all who supported the Union party, for the separation between the two parties was bitter and unforgiving. But of charity in the ordinary sense of the care of the destitute there was no significant increase because there was no peculiar need.  Here again the fact that the free land could be easily reached is the final explanation.  There was no need for the unemployed workman to become a pauper.  He could take advantage of the Homestead Act\\\\*, which was passed in 1862, and acquire a farm of 160 acres free; or he could secure at almost nominal cost farm-land which had been given to railways as an inducement to build. Under the Homestead Act, the Government gave away land amounting to 2,400,000 acres before the close of the war.  The Illinois Central alone sold to actual settlers 221,000 acres in 1863 and 264,000 in 1864.  It was during the war, too, that the great undertaking of the transcontinental railway was begun, partly for military and partly for commercial reasons.  In this project, both as a field of labor and as a stimulus to Western settlement, there is also to be found one more device for the relief of the labor situation in the East.\\n\\n\\\\*This Act, which may be regarded as the culmination of the long battle of the Northern dreamers to win \\\"land for the landless,\\\" provided that every settler who was, or intended to be, a citizen might secure 180 acres of government land by living on it and cultivating it for five years.\\n\\nThere is no more important phenomenon of the time than the shifting of large masses of population from the East to the West, while the war was in progress.  This fact begins to indicate why there was no shortage in the agricultural output.  The North suffered acutely from inflation of prices and from a speculative wildness that accompanied the inflation, but it did not suffer from a lack of those things that are produced by the soil--food, timber, metals, and coal.  In addition to the reason just mentioned--the search for new occupation by Eastern labor which had been thrown out of employment--three other causes helped to maintain the efficiency of work in the mines, in the forests, and on the farms.  These three factors were immigration, the labor of women, and labor-saving machines.\\n\\nImmigration, naturally, fell off to a certain degree but it did not become altogether negligible.  It is probable that 110,000 able-bodied men came into the country while war was in progress--a poor offset to the many hundred thousand who became soldiers, but nevertheless a contribution that counted for something.\\n\\nVastly more important, in the work of the North, was the part taken by women.  A pathetic detail with which in our own experience the world has again become familiar was the absence of young men throughout most of the North, and the presence of women new to the work in many occupations, especially farming.  A single quotation from a home missionary in Iowa tells the whole story:\\n\\n\\\"I will mention that I met more women driving teams on the road and saw more at work in the fields than men.  They seem to have said to their husbands in the language of a favorite song,\\n\\n'Just take your gun and go;  For Ruth can drive the oxen, John, And I can use the hoe!'\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/43](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/43)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637675134,\"title\":\"\\nHowever, at the very time when he wrote this remarkable letter, he had in his own mind entered upon the third stage of his policy.\"},\"digest\":\"5EpcWETyE-qD5f5bW65C6Rs02B0PMM4bQqQrqjtmxuc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6A321BD15f7B900C7F8Dd29Ce6ed73fa0E7D220F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h1HEaf7ENLEQTFHZgFiUxe_RUryBDATN31tVbxS4apA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wsa-W9-zRQh2gkReGppasig07CGduxsB4_pT1fhHSA4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"APR7O092CqbYKbH6Zx6aYWeQBMeRuc0oEJLjpnw_vr14xWXx3c-5TVzZEOf-Wyl_iR43ojhr-HhJ5v9ZcmDMrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xfd3e693edc96c9f517ff7955b8404e7f2b23c61372a8e675bd4f56b4ede95c135f0b1392782ac9836e608224fbf91dba817edcccee7f6b2a59e1043c6f369bae1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"h1HEaf7ENLEQTFHZgFiUxe_RUryBDATN31tVbxS4apA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wsa-W9-zRQh2gkReGppasig07CGduxsB4_pT1fhHSA4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5EpcWETyE-qD5f5bW65C6Rs02B0PMM4bQqQrqjtmxuc\"}"
