"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Value creation of innovation\\n\\nInnovation is the new way of combining existing ideas. The resulting new ideas can be recombined into new forms, leading to further cycles of innovation. This idea evolution enables exponential value creation through the magic of innovation compounding.\\n\\nThe pace of innovation compounding magic is determined by the **availability**, **composability** and **interaction** of existing ideas or building blocks. Higher quantity, broader compatibility and higher collision frequency of ideas all increase the pace of value creation through innovation. Applying this simple mental model to the current NFT ecosystem, gives us a good sense of the incredible value creation opportunities that lie ahead.\\n\\n1. **Availability**\\n\\n   Ideas are thoughts. They are infinite and only bounded by the willingness and ability of the creator to express them. The availability of interconnected global talent pool with a broad set of knowledge across art, music, finance, gaming and many other sectors creates an opportunity for an infinite source of ideas. Ideas expressed in digital world create digital asset value.\\n\\n   The NFTs enable ownership and transfer of the creator’s digital asset value. The minting of the NFT establishes an immutable record (smart contract) of the creator’s digital asset on the blockchain. This record enables digital asset property rights, provenance tracking and value capture for its creator, which unlocks infinite creative forces for new ideas in the NFT ecosystem.\\n\\n   The first wave of NFT creators has already generated a multitude of innovative use cases and meaningful value creation. In music, we saw [Kings of Leon](https://opensea.io/assets/0x557430421f8f3ed0a92aca211f1c05ad7b606288/0) raise $2m from NFT album sale in support of the live music crews during the pandemic. In gaming, the launch of the play-to-earn [Axie Infinity](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/) NFTs has provided much-needed income for thousands of families in the Philippines. Finally, in metaverse the [Mana](https://market.decentraland.org/) NFT marketplace enables digital artists from all over the world to create and monetize their digital asset ideas.\\n2. **Composability**\\n\\n   The value proposition of the NFTs goes beyond ownership and transfer of digital asset value. NFT smart contracts created on the same blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) can be programmed to interact with each other in a trustless and permissionless environment. This modular feature enables innovation compounding and exponential value creation through a combination of existing NFTs into new forms (e.g. [BYAC](https://www.animocabrands.com/bored-ape-yacht-club-and-animoca-brands-join-forces-to-make-blockchain-nft-game) developing play-to-earn game using existing NFTs). In addition, the availability of secure cross-chain bridges (e.g. [Solana to Ethereum](https://wormholebridge.com/#/)) will increase NFT interoperability and turbocharge the innovation cycle.\\n\\n   The composability feature so far has proven most valuable in the DeFi ecosystem, which is composed of interoperable and trustless smart contract applications ([dApps](https://dappradar.com/defi)). The composability of DeFi has enabled an accelerated pace of financial innovation and value creation for the [$200bn+](https://defillama.com/) of digital assets deployed on the ecosystem. This innovation in DeFi is already converging with the evolution of NFT digital assets, unlocking their value through NFT collateralized lending ([NFTfi](https://nftfi.com/)) and fractional ownership ([Fractional](https://nftfi.com/)) solutions.\\n3. **Interaction**\\n\\n   The availability and composability of existing ideas will not lead to meaningful innovation if the ideas are siloed and are not given chance to interact with each other. For the ideas to combine in novel ways there needs to be a sufficiently high frequency of idea cross-pollination. This interaction is best achieved by existing interconnected networks, such as roads, airways and of course the internet.\\n\\n![We feel alone, and in this we are connected. We build networks to reaffirm this connection, which enables boundless opportunities for idea cross-pollination and innovation.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/_zYXK--3GDASYZNdjhmqC.png?height=661&width=1352)\\n\\nThe internet is a super network that happens to be incredibly efficient at propagating information (mostly memes) and enabling interaction of ideas, all at the speed of light and almost zero marginal cost. The emerging NFT communities are leveraging the enormous network effects of the existing Web 2.0 social platforms. These ideas superhighways turbocharge the pace of NFT innovation and digital value creation.  \\n\\n![Creators and communities will leverage existing centralized platform networks to propagate NFT ideas and evolve into decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/F3keoHwzHC6de400idOCy.png?height=481&width=1281)\\n\\nThe velocity of the idea propagation in the NFT ecosystem is further boosted by the economic incentive structure of the community-owned crypto projects. As the blockchain enables self-custodial digital asset ownership by both the creator and the NFT project community, this encourages the propagation (i.e. shilling) of ideas through community member networks. As a result, crypto-native projects tend to rapidly propagate through existing social networks and benefit from the light-bending speed of innovation.\\n\\nFinally, the permissionless access of NFT projects and blockchain protocols (similar to open API) enables almost frictionless cross-project composability. This means that NFT creators are free to choose which other projects or protocols they want to interact with. The possibilities are truly endless.   \",\"timestamp\":1640860962,\"title\":\"NFT 2.0 - Evolution Beyond JPEGs\"},\"digest\":\"qLUH_x9Y6o0zdZP2DjM7JYPSNTD3fLzzGXXjB1zbN-8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF19E2d3Ac06Bf3498E0BeEF145b6AB2C274636C8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WE5oT4OhH4sZbMhgJikZ9Kwuzd5MhHrHEpTlFt2G8vs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ekDZCJHpLV4h7Ti1HhY96fG57sfy7hKnLWOG3Y-X3Jc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6dFY-LI7OyHNOD0mcUKGCtZofDIjzerK0gWFdVTTnny2SYH8FBRuQlCg92aUp6yL8g-cE-6ORkR-5DvNnO9piw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4e0a821fabb02fc26657898eec1baf3d99a1f2a40a21b0d7a2dcde0e3b4f8e9f55347517fc483e2ae8faa65032b1255ed4cadf0db14eaa48bfc2f13c5b8799ed1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"WE5oT4OhH4sZbMhgJikZ9Kwuzd5MhHrHEpTlFt2G8vs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ekDZCJHpLV4h7Ti1HhY96fG57sfy7hKnLWOG3Y-X3Jc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qLUH_x9Y6o0zdZP2DjM7JYPSNTD3fLzzGXXjB1zbN-8\"}"
