"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The more I think about it, the more I can see the potential for what I am about to say here to cause sweeping changes in the world. Unions are coming for tech, but these unions are going to look very different than the unions of old. In this article, I will explore why Decentralized Autonomous Organizations may result in the rapid return of workers unions to power, with profound consequences for the tech industry.\\n\\nTo summarize my argument:\\n\\n* I believe that Labor Unions will return as powerful Decentralized Autonomous Organizations which are able to mint and control their own funds and exert leverage across the tech industry via their elite skilled membership\\n* These Labor Unions will grow to become significant political and economic influencing entities capable of going “toe-to-toe” with major corporations and governments\\n* I believe that communities of ethnic minorities and women, especially from the STEM fields, represent an ideal starting point for these organizations and that change may happen faster than we might expect\\n\\nI have been watching the forces beneath the surface bubbling for the last decade. Am I right? Perhaps. But my instinct tells me something big is coming, and soon.\\n\\n### A history lesson on Unions\\n\\nBefore we get started, I need to first revisit the concept of “A Union.” Basically: Workers organize together into some structure which wields significant negotiating power on their behalf. Unions were once The Community’s champions in negotiating with The State and The Market on behalf of workers. [They were once a much more influential force in American society than they are today](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxFkM1uhCAUhZ9m2I3hRxEXLLrpa5gLXJVWwQDW-vbFmUUTAuT-5DvnWCg4x3TpPeZC7mss14464JlXLAUTOTKm0TvNKGVCKuI07bntDfF5nBLiBn7VZD_M6i0UH8M9LDjlZNHCdpIPrhssmB5sC9RMg1OTNAom6NibCIfzGCzqGNZr3ME7suqllD0_xMeDf9ZznmezxPiDqYlproWEGSHZpX4d2tUHfB6hwvNzjtE9b_3E66qC0aqFDR1nbcMa2fXIuFCgoKX91E5KAWuF6OVkJDPs0dJtZk0-TC5gvxsbN5J0wt9cvuISanu-_b7q1fJY361yyzViALOi0yUdSMo7z1c244wBU83ZjVA0k0xyOQxCSdq-7d9xVTFKdZxUsIt1K_wz_wC2Io1n).\\n\\nOver the last one hundred years, The Market and The State have collaborated to use regulations [and even military force to suppress and destroy Unions](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxFkE1uxCAMhU8z7BrxkxCyYDGbXqDqGjngZGgzEIHTdm5f0llUQrawMe_z80C45vKwe67EzuDosaNN-F03JMLCjorFxWAF50Jpw4Llo_TjzGJ1S0G8Q9ws2495ix4o5nQ-VpJLdrPLoIEL6bnXAcS0gJ8MBGWGXvmhn9VTEY4QMXm0OW0Pt0MMbLM3or1e1PUiX9vB1H3Hz7hjiNDlsrbSeW_pmii-HOnU_Yp5O_9xMTm6oXtPkTC4N2pLVhZtYxK8kYlpkKLvRKeHEYVUBgz0fFz6xRgQvVKjXmYtZnHp-X0VXT3mSuA_O5_vrNiCP5U-8i219npu_1dvBriW7w2FHg4TzBsGS-VARk93_5xyKyYscHIBWaGFlnqalNG8f5pxmtdgjBkka8Iht6n0r_kLrsiSbQ), [culminating with actions by President Ronald Reagan during the 1980s](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxFUctuxCAM_JrllgjIixw49NLfiExwsrQEIiDN5u_rdA-V0NhgWzMeZii4xnTpPebCbpjKtaMOeGaPpWBiR8Y0OasF56LpFbOaD3IeDHN5WhLiBs5rth_GuxmKi-FubiSX7KlF25llHvkCaEwLVo1qEYMUSs3Y8RHfjHBYh2FGHYO_ph2cZV4_S9nzo_l4yE8653nWS4y-nuNGVxd-MBcXVspXDJjAUyZJIAWubugIyhMrC1eVYgBvq4SwQqhOhG-asdVdhg0T6Q6VBxNTDXl_MadJveC0gxg7Kdpa1H03oJCNAgUtH5Z2UQpE2zRDv5heGPFo-baKOh8mF5i_b5ks6YSvXL7iM1B5vX36eyerJorbEVy5JgxgPFpd0oGsvP_hz9PpvVhBO0HRohe97MexUT1v37bdNpMYpTrJiNhGmgr_nL8q3p6b). As a result of The State and The Market collusion, Unions no longer have the power and influence they once possessed.\\n\\nA significant additional cause of the downfall of unions was intense international competition which adversely affected corporations where workers were predominantly unionized, as was the case for [Detroit automakers during the 1980s](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxFUcty5CAM_JrhhovX2PjAIZf9DRcG2UPCgAvkeOfvF5JNpYoSQi2paclZhD2XlzlyRdLNgq8DTIKrRkCEQs4KZQnecMa4HDXxhk3CTSsJddkKwNOGaMhxrjE4iyGnniwFE-RhpnECoeZm7Ka9YtKpdbazEiA34bT6ZrSnD5AcmJziazls8CSaB-JRb_LtJv60c13XgA_YY17BJt85B5efDfkKUV_CJ7SX9Z-Q8CzdL-BpDKm7rZSWUIG2WrrZGGneqAcsOSC1lXa8twhpp1suDjreg84WeuUSfe9dMLgIQjPJtWAtQoJpOjlravl8F1wNfBjvE3AhtdVWsWlTm9aWKymncVtHvvKbYs-dD_VcK1r30VWQYgr8rfieH6nB-4-6PtSl3c8zBXwtkOwawRssJxD83tjX9JcdEpS2Sb9YNHzkoxjnWeqR_R9wX0j7jNZ3QRqxz60q_XL-A2pireU).\\n\\n### Tech worker unions have made slow progress\\n\\nThere have been some attempts in tech, but the going has been slow, [with large tech companies seemingly able to shrug off and fire organizers at will](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxFkMtuhSAQhp_msKvhosBZsOimr2EQRqVFMDDG-vbFcxZNJjMwl_x_PmcRllwus-eK5E4jXjuYBGeNgAiFHBXKGLxhlDIhNfGGKu7UREId5wKw2RAN2Y8pBmcx5HQvC045WY0STlLw_jlrpYYe7DxwOinHBLWz7ulb0R4-QHJgcorXuNvgSTQr4l4f4vPBv1qc59mlC8MGtXN5ax1O2bMVxu730BKCW1OOebnaZ8l5ifAxhwL148zlB0rtVtwiCaZZY1Tc9wNnfcc6OShgXGirbU_V3M9aW9YLoeQ8STaxR0-3hXX1mCpa93MbIMUU-K34ndfUxssN4dVvHMZWtyMFvEZIdorgDZYDCL4hv4CNCyQoDb4fLRommeTy-RRa0v7N5GbYzGg9cNKEfW5X6V_zDwcUkfE). It also feels that there are many downsides to Unions which make highly skilled creative and technical workers (who are often highly compensated for their work) unwilling to participate in such structures.\\n\\n> **All this feels like it is about to change, because a series of technology advancements have made it possible for unions to return in a new, redesigned form.**\\n\\n### Digital Reparations\\n\\nI personally have largely been cool on the topic of unions due to some of the downsides mentioned above. However, the events leading up to and following the firing of AI researcher and ethicist Timnit Gebru [felt like a tipping point](https://email.mg1.substack.com/c/eJxFkM1uhSAQhZ_mstMAInAXLLrpaxiQUWkVDD9pffuO9y6akDMBZjiHb7YV1pQvc6ZSyS1TvU4wEX7KDrVCJq1AnoI3jFI2SE28oYrPypFQpiUDHDbshpzN7WG2NaR4Nw-ccrIZx4RSytlROeHEIKlkikql6eKfgkv3drTNB4gzmBT3azpt8GQ3W61neQwfD_6Ja0m5tgj9nA7c4eMUC-O3SJQ1pXWHznahy1DA5nmD3KVW8ANdDUcMtVvB5Ya9JBicZxQjsufImehZL0cFjA_aaiuoWsSitWViGJRcnGSOPQQ9VtaX5kq18_cdg2ST4bfUr7RFvF5vDK9zJDFhPRqaXhNE63bwpuYGpL4xv5BNK0TIiN9PthommeTy-Ry0pOJN5aaIYbQeOUFjn3Aq_nv-AZxCkTo). In reading the discussions online, I came to realize that the rage and frustration within the black community has grown to a point that can no longer be merely ignored.\\n\\nSome of the concerns I witnessed (to name a few):\\n\\n* Superficial efforts at diversity meant to placate ethnic workers over the last few years no longer are trusted by the black community\\n* The tokenization of black workers as statistics or KPIs to parade in front of investors is resented (to put it mildly)\\n* Situations where black workers who have inconvenient opinions are “Swapped” for other black workers has left many in the community filled with rage\\n\\nThe groundwork now seems to be in place for decentralized Unions, and the motivation is there - But what is missing is the action.\\n\\n### The future I can imagine\\n\\nHere is the future that I can imagine. This is just one possibility, but I think you can understand where I am going with this:\\n\\nImagine the following:\\n\\n* Black STEM workers organize into a global distributed workers union as a DAO\\n* The DAO is funded globally by donations from the community, cryptocurrency world, large corporate investors\\n* The DAO launches it’s own Ethereum-backed token\\n* The DAO organizes itself into a governance structure with governance tokens granted to Black and underprivileged workers\\n* DAO members who hold the token receive a monthly payment funded by the investment fund and tech sponsors\\n* Members are brought into the organization by way of interview and screening process to ensure they match the desires of the community\\n* The DAO opens an investment fund which consists of a token on the Ethereum block chain that invests in black workers projects and provides community grants\\n* Members begin receiving pension options and other benefits, all denominated in cryptocurrencies\\n* The longer you are a member of the DAO, and the more you contribute, the larger the future pension will be for black workers\\n* Large tech companies wanting to hire members of the union must fund the DAO or be ineligible to hire it’s members\\n* Workers who decide to join tech companies who do not fund the DAO receive reduced privileges until those tech companies agree to pay into the DAO\\n\\nIn other words: I foresee a world where black workers are paid every month by being members of a giant distributed DAO which negotiates with the tech world on their behalf.\\n\\nThank you, thats enough for today.\",\"timestamp\":1636962216,\"title\":\"Unions Are Coming To Tech (via DAOs)\"},\"digest\":\"Vip_mg09hD5b8BGquXizBEbvyddF6wAgGf7OIUTmJkw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x66e21eCf1E31fFd838F9DFC59cC283E181Fb8F8C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lUGBTAu_jsbYO7aNQJ6haNcb_jWTyo73aZ8MIIF51zQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DifWeWIynJcs_hHNc7rhy9uDYuH8ACZMJE6WrqHa-F0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"28hr6Lb4aKP4Jo_a8Zv45KqoY_gvkOZUz3toBzLsAuvRkDAr5dh-CcCpoFyU8rwX0QmRy1hxEH-vjMug6HFhbA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3e31cddbc3b26fa5d3303b68acb95976fe4aa7b8414faf2476fe2d7b5dbfc75a022a9a0e18d577cbd1f7c82c0addd563877e0ba181f16643fea1487c888bc3501b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"lUGBTAu_jsbYO7aNQJ6haNcb_jWTyo73aZ8MIIF51zQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DifWeWIynJcs_hHNc7rhy9uDYuH8ACZMJE6WrqHa-F0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Vip_mg09hD5b8BGquXizBEbvyddF6wAgGf7OIUTmJkw\"}"
