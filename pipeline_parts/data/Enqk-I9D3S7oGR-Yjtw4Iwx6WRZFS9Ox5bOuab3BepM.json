"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**一、中文版本**\\n\\n**Q1：今天特别高兴邀请到 people 大宇社区的团队来参加今天的AMA，首先，请团队的主联络员@BTCdayu 介绍一下你们团队吧。**\\n\\n[@BTCdayu](https://twitter.com/BTCdayu)：主持人好，很高兴参加今天的AMA活动。我们社区因People的精神感召而成立，以“of the people, by the people,for the people”为发展的理念，号召每个人以义务的形式参与到people建设中来，持续为people赋能。\\n\\n\\n我们认为，这是DAO的生动实践——我们围绕一致的目标，集合不同能力的人，从不同角度共同发力，去做很多很酷的事情。\\n\\n\\n我们特别注重推进 people 生态壮大，致力于不断开发新的功能，为people持有者谋取利益——团队承诺永远不谋获取任何私利，每个参与者的唯一获益渠道是从公开市场购买people，并持有它。\\n\\n\\n这也是我们社区理念，“人人都是参与者、人人都是建设者，人人都是享有者”。目前我们的理念得到了非常多的赞同，中文社区有17000名用户，均为真实用户，活跃度和参与度很高，我们成立了DeFI、NFT、GAMEFI、宣传组等不同的开发小组，积极推进各个项目。\\n\\n\\n目前DeFI组由zero.one团队领衔，开发了people的借贷协议，具体稍后由团队的负责人robin.ph介绍，同时更多产品还在研发之中；NFT小组目前包括与币安投资的melos.studio达成合作，即将推出people的NFT作品，由社区成员免费MINT；而像宣传组等，每天自发宣传people，成员热情很高。\\n\\n 我们认为，BTC开启去中心化共识的新时代，而PEOPLE将开启去中心化自治的新纪元。 我们相信，会有越来越多人参与到这场去中心化自治的伟大试验中来。\\n\\n\\n**Q2:大宇社区为people发展做了很多贡献，包括我知道他们近期推进了头部审计机构hacken 加入people 进行免费审计，这是社区成员 rushber_ 所积极对接的。rushber_今天也来到了AMA现场，你对people发展是怎么看的？是什么驱动你去为people努力工作的？**\\n\\nA：主持人好，我是[Rushber_](https://twitter.com/RushBer_) ，我对People 这个代币背后融合的WEB3.0和DAO的理念等非常认同，也为大宇社区“人人都是参与者、人人都是建设者，人人都是享有者”而感觉到激动，在这一段时间的参与中，无论是大宇还是我们每一位成员，都做到了无私奉献，一心一意为people去做自己力所能及的事情。\\n\\n我加入people大家庭以后，几乎每天都会有8个小时以上在做各种宣传和推广，同时也利用手中资源，积极对接了审计等事件。hacken是业界的顶级审计机构，与其说是我对接的，更不如说是他们也为 people的理念所感召。\\n\\n\\npeople现在还在极早期，但目前发展势头极好，这就像滚雪球，相信会越滚越大。\\n\\n今天，KUCOIN的加入，也将成为people发展历程中的重要一步。 在此，也祝愿KUCOIN越办越好。\\n\\n**Q3：感谢@rushber_  大宇社区着力为people生态助力的方式，非常有利于项目的长远发展，目前社区的zero.one团队在项目开发上有非常丰富的经验，今天也请到了zero one的负责人 robin.ph ，能否谈谈你对people的理解和打算呢？**\\n\\nA:主持人好，大家好，[我是robin.ph](https://twitter.com/zeroonerobin) ，我们团队此前有着比较丰富的开发经验，做了flux等多个协议。最近，我们为people开发了很棒的质押借贷功能，为所有people提供借贷服务，也欢迎大家体验，网址是flux.01.finance\\n\\n我们也是一个dao组织，从一开始就加入并积极推进people的发展，这是一个有趣的社区实验。\\n\\n我们计划围绕people代币研发稳定币pusd，同时为people与pusd提供金融服务。例如：衍生品交易、机枪池等服务。\\n\\n\\n**Q4:感谢@robin.ph的发言，那么people作为一个由DAO衍生的社区，在DAO方面有会做哪一些建设呢，我们请有丰富DAO开发经验的@duuli1来为大家做下介绍。**\\n\\nA：主持人好，大家好，我是duuli，我自己目前主要从事web3的开发，也做过一些成熟的DAO产品。\\n\\npeople作为初始的DAO，我们这边最终的目标是把它做成一个全球的大型组织（或者说是’公司‘），全球的人为之工作，人人都可以参与建设，可以全职或者兼职，也可以获得报酬与荣誉。\\n\\n这个目标很长远，前期我们主要聚焦的是怎么通过现有的Web3工具实现一个DAO的决策与管理的平台，另外就是创建一个专属于平台的NFT，通过赋能NFT来促进管理效率。\\n\\n相信在不远的未来人们可以很方便的通过工具为$People做自己的贡献。\\n\\n\\n**Q5: 大宇社区为people的赋能不仅仅在于执行力上，大量的真实布道者与强大的号召力也维持着社区和谐的氛围与巨大的热度，这是因为大宇社区下设了专用于宣传的组织。宣传组负责人Jokki今天也参与了AMA的活动，那么Jokki可以向大家介绍一下宣传组吗**\\n\\nA：主持人好，各位朋友们好，我是大宇社区宣传组的负责人Jokki，事实上我与大多数$people长期持有者一样，能赋能people的方式恐怕只有不断地力所能及的布道与推广，没有办法推进大的项目。\\n\\n\\n毕竟people的生命周期不久，一开始的宣传组并没有那么强大的号召力，后面在people的低谷期，我发现这个问题愈加严重，遂主动联系了大宇毛遂自荐而成为了负责人，后来通过不断地传播people的理念而召集了越来越多真正的信仰者参与进people的推广工作中，目前主要工作是活跃推特与电报群。\\n\\n\\n现在的宣传组其实并不只是去做点赞、转发、评论等无脑操作，也不会硬性规定，更多的是鼓励大家发自内心的去为people的宣传工作做些什么，在宣传组内，可以将对社区工作的创意想法与建设意见摊开进行讨论，为people的社区建设添砖加瓦。\\n\\n\\n正是因为宣传组的理念如此，才让越来越多的人主动参与到一系列活动中去，并成为people真正的信仰者甚至成为真正的布道者。\\n\\n__________________________________________________________\\n\\n**二、ENGLISH VISION**\\n\\nZed, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:03\\\\]\\nToday, we will have an important guests  for our AMA session.\\n\\nLet us all give a warm virtual welcome to…\\n\\n@BTCdayu PEOPLE Dayu Community Leader\\n\\nWelcome @BTCdayu ! Please say hi to our AMA participants\\n\\n@BTCdayu：Hello moderator, Hello,everyone, I am so glad to join today's AMA event.\\n\\nZED：Awesome, let's keep going so you can share as much info about your content today.\\n\\n**@BTCdayu：**\\n\\nOur community was founded by the spirit of People, with the concept of \\\"of the people, by the people, for the people\\\", calling on everyone to participate in the construction of $People in the form of volunteer, and continuously empowering $People.\\n\\nWe believe that $People is a vivid practice of DAO(decentralized autonomous organization). For the same goal, we gather people with different abilities together to do a lot of cool things.\\n\\nWe are particularly focused on making the people ecosystem solid and are committed to constantly developing new features for the benefit of people holders - the team is committed to never seeking any personal gain, and the only way for each participant to benefit is to buy people from the secondary market and hold.\\n\\nThis is also our community philosophy, \\\"Everyone is a participant, a builder, and ultimately a beneficiary.\\\". Currently our philosophy is very much endorsed, the Chinese community has 17k users, all of them are real people with high level of engagement, and we have set up different development teams such as DeFi, NFT, GameFi, and promo-groups to keep promoting our projects.\\n\\nThe DeFi team is currently led by the \\\"zero one\\\" team, which has developed a lending protocol for $PEOPLE, is going to be introduced soon by the team leader [robin.ph](http://robin.ph), while more products are still under development.\\nThe NFT team currently is cooperating with \\\"melos.studio\\\", which is invested by Coinan, and will soon launch NFT works for $People, maybe free for community members to mint.\\nThe promo team keep spontaneously propagandizing $People every day.Our members are very enthusiastic.\\n\\nWe believe that BTC opens a new era of decentralized consensus, and $People will open a new era of decentralized autonomy. We believe that more and more people will participate in this great experiment of decentralized autonomy.\\n\\nWelcome to follow me on Twitter @BTCdayu and join our community: <https://t.me/dayu222> (Chinese Community)\\n\\n**Q2:The Dayu community has made a lot of contributions to the development of $PEOPLE, including collaborating with Hacken, the top cyber security and auditing company, to audit the smart contract of $PEOPLE, which has actively connected by community member RushBer_. RushBer_ also came to the AMA scene today. What do you think of the development of $PEOPLE? What drives you to work hard for $PEOPLE?**\\n\\n**Backbone of Dayu Community Promotion Team: Rushber_**\\n\\n **Rushber_:**\\n\\nHello, everyone, I’m Rushber_. I very much agree with the concept of the integration of WEB3.0 and DAO behind the $PEOPLE token. I feel excited about the concept of ‘of the people, by the people, for the people’. During this period of participation, with Dayu and each of our members have achieved selfless dedication and dedicated themselves to doing what they can for people.\\n\\n\\nAfter I joined the $PEOPLE community, I spent more than 8 hours doing various kinds of publicity and promotion almost every day. At the same time, I also used the resources at hand to actively respond to audits and so on. Hacken is top cyber security and auditing company. It is not that much that I connect with it, it is more that they are also inspired by the concept of people.\\n\\n\\nBesides, there are many crypto lovers around the world participated in this great community, as far as from my personal cycle, including royal families, governmental officials, successful businessmen, and professional institutions from Middle East, Asia, and Europe.\\n\\n\\n$PEOPLE is still in the very early stage, but the current development momentum is wonderful. This is like a snowball and I believe it will get bigger and bigger.\\n\\n\\nToday, the contributions of KUCOIN will also become an important step in the development of $PEOPLE. Here, I also wish KUCOIN will have a bright future.\\n\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\n**Q3**  Zed, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:14\\\\] \\n\\nExcellent team, excellent members！\\nOk let's continue..\\nThank you @rushber_ for the way the Dayu community works hard to help people’s ecology, which is very conducive to the long-term development of the project. At present, the zero.one team in the community has very rich experience in project development. Today, I also invited robin, the person in charge of zero one. .ph, can you talk about your understanding and plans for people?\\n\\n**Zero one-Robin, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:18\\\\]**\\nhello everyone, my name is Robin. Ph. Our team has great development experience and has made flux and other protocols. Recently, we have developed a great pledge lending feature for people, which is available to  people tokens, and you are welcome to try it. The website is flux.01.Finance\\n\\nWe are also a DAO organization and have been involved and actively promoting the development of People since the very beginning, which is an interesting community experiment.\\n\\nWe plan to develop stablecoin PUSD around people token and provide financial services for both people and PUSD. For example: futures trading, vaults and other services\\n\\nWelcome to follow my twitter @zeroonerobin. Thanks.\\n\\n**Q4**\\n\\nZed, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:21\\\\]\\nSo coool!\\\\~ Thank you @ZeroOneRobin 👏\\n\\nAnd the next one: Thanks for the speech from @ZeroOneRobin , so people as a community derived from DAO, in terms of DAO, what kind of construction will there be? We ask @duuli1 who has rich experience in DAO development to do the following introduction for everyone.\\n\\nduu, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:22\\\\]\\nHello, everyone, I am @duuli1, I am mainly engaged in web3 development, and I have also done some mature DAO products.\\n\\n\\nI am very interested in DAO, so I joined the Dayu community to build a decentralized autonomous community around $People.\\n\\n\\nIn fact, DAO can be understood as the future form of Web3 organization. $People as the initial DAO, The goal of us is to make community be like a large global organization (or 'company')\\n\\n\\npeople from all over the world work for it, everyone can participate in the construction, can be full-time or part-time.They can work full time or part time and get paid and honored.\\n\\n\\nThis is a very long-term goal, and our team's focus is on how to implement a DAO platform to make decision through the exist Web3 tools.\\n\\n\\nThe other job is to create a NFT owned by platform, through the empowerment of NFT to grow management efficiency. We believe that in the near future, people can easily contribute to $People through our tools.\\n\\nThank you!\\n\\n**Q5:**\\n\\nZed, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:26\\\\]\\nGreat community！\\n\\nDayu community empowerment for $people not just about execution. A large number of authentic ‘preachers’ and powerful call to action also keep the community peaceful atmosphere and great heat. This is because the Dayu community has an team dedicated to promote. And the leader of the team Jokki participate today’s AMA, so jokki , why not to introduce this special team?\\n\\njokki, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:28\\\\]\\nHey everyone, it’s jokki! who lead the publicity team.\\nBut in fact, I am like most $people holders, what can we do to empower $people maybe just to keep preaching and promoting as much as we can.\\n\\nAfter all, $people were not born long ago, so at first, this publicity team didn’t have a strong appeal. And then $people experience a low period and this problem became more serious. So, I recommend myself to Dayu and I become the leader of the team. After spread the word about $people, more and more true believers of $people get involved in the promotion of $people. Currently the main job of team is to be active on Twitter and Telegraph groups, and let more people know about $people, because people need $people.\\n\\nToday the publicity team not just like RT comment and so on simple jobs, and we won’t make hard and fast requirements. More than that, we encourage people to do something from the heart to promote $PEOPLE's work. Within the community building views, creative ideas for community work and ideas for building can be spread out and discussed to add to PEOPLE's community building.\\n\\n\\nIt is because of this philosophy of the advocacy team that more and more people are coming forward to participate in a range of activities and to become true believers and even true evangelists of $PEOPLE.\\n\\n\\nThat's all, THX @Yasuo_KuCoin\\n\\n***FREE -ASK SECTION***\\n\\nZed, \\\\[2021/12/22 18:32\\\\] I believe people will very like your team😉That wraps up the first part of the AMA session.Thank you all guests for a very informative  session.Let’s now proceed to the free-ask section.

How reliable and secure is your smart contract? Have you tested it through any of the parties?**\\n\\n@Rushber_ : A good question about security! First of all, the ownership of this project has been renounced a day ago, which is able to check on chain, so I would like to say there will not be any specific team can manipulate or do rugpull to this project, $PEOPLE is like $BTC, but with redeeming to burning police, fully decentralized. Regrads the smart contract, it has been audited by Trusklook and  many community members who are able to audit have done the auditing by themselves, both with the result of 100% safe. Besides, Hacken is auditing now and I expect the result will be reported by the end of the year.\\n\\n4\\\\.\\n\\nAnswer to @RenateFink\\n\\nJOKKI: I want you know that $people belong to people, Everyone is a project party of PEOPLE. So Defi, NFT, yield farm, and so on will be created by every people believers. And now we already have some projects, such as NFT and Defi. You can find them in peopleDAO community. And you can check these links to know the $people's background: ConstitutionDAO from bloomberg and the wall street !!!\\n\\n<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-20/crypto-crowdfunding-goes-mainstream-with-constitutiondao-bid>\\n\\n<https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-groups-bid-for-constitution-faces-real-world-snagswho-picks-it-up-11637187153>\\n\\n**5.@shinhollingsworth1991:Too many projects promise magic but never release any working product or prove any revenue, Within a short/long time of release. Is your project also like this? If not can u tell us, What makes your project different from other projects?**\\n\\n@RUSHBER:\\n\\nYes, I agree with your opion about big talks in crypto world. Hoever, I would like to say $PEOPLE will never be like those scamming projects. Here is my reason:\\n\\n1. The dev team of this project is already renounced ownership, it means no one could control it, from all aspects, like price, burning system, releasing new tokens, no, it is impossible to manulate anymore.\\n2. Becoz of #1, this project has become fully decentralized, that means all communities about this project could empower it, it depends on the strategy of communities (there are various communities and will be more), so no one is in charge of this project, and if one community stop working on this project, there are still other communities working on it.\\n3. $PEOPLE is fully decentralized now, so it is like $BTC, no owners, everybody could own it fairly. I noticed there are also some projects claimed they are decntralized like BTC, but the central dev team is still there, we do have central dev team anymore, everyone is the developer.\\n4. $PEOPLE tokens are from ConstitutionDAO, there is a famous talks for U.S constitution, ' of the people, by the people, for the people'. This project is of the people, by the people, for the people.\\n\\n**6.I want to support your project, Tell us more about the Ambassador Program and in what ways can we participate ?**\\n\\n@rushber:\\n\\nCurrently, we do not have Ambassador Program, becoz this project is fully decentralized, so it means any one could do any thing to empower it, you can be the Ambassador for this project is you wish. About the ways to participate, I will indicate ways to participate in this great project here:\\n\\n1. Everyone can establish a community around $PEOPLE, but it requires of correct understanding of the project it self, like what we are doing, for example, I reached to CEO of Hacken, to spread the idea of this project, of DAO(Decetralized Autonomous Organization), and asked him to join with his company doing auditing for this project, this is the way how we empower it.\\n2. If you do not have enough time but you have interests in this project, in terms of investing, just thinking about the similarity between $PEOPLE and $BTC, they are like twins now, but $BTC leads a new ERA of decentralised consensus, now $people leads a new CENTURY of decentralised autonomy. So you can also do investment with $PEOPLE, and there are several DeFi protocol offer the financial services to this token, and I am sure there will be more in the near future. Another way of participating.\\n   3\\\\.You can also join any communities which is relative to this project, as a community member and as a participant.\\n\\nThere are many ways, but there three are what I recommend for all. I hope I answer your question clearly. Thank you!\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*finish\\n\\nZed, \\\\[2021/12/22 19:14\\\\]\\nThat’s it for our AMA guests.
