"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"You talk along boys,\\\" Sheldon said, with increasing irritation. \\\"You tell 'm get to hell along beach.  Then I talk with you.\\\"\\n\\nSheldon felt a slight vibration of the veranda, and knew that Joan had come out and was standing by his side.  But he did not dare glance at her.  There were too many rifles down below there, and rifles had a way of going off from the hip.\\n\\nAgain the veranda vibrated with her moving weight, and he knew that Joan had gone into the house.  A minute later she was back beside him.  He had never seen her smoke, and it struck him as peculiar that she should be smoking now.  Then he guessed the reason.  With a quick glance, he noted the hand at her side, and in it the familiar, paper-wrapped dynamite.  He noted, also, the end of fuse, split properly, into which had been inserted the head of a wax match.\\n\\n\\\"Telepasse, you old reprobate, tell 'm boys clear out along beach. My word, I no gammon along you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Me no gammon,\\\" said the chief.  \\\"Me want 'm pay white Mary bang 'm head b'long Gogoomy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'll come down there and bang 'm head b'long you,\\\" Sheldon replied, leaning toward the railing as if about to leap over.\\n\\nAn angry murmur arose, and the blacks surged restlessly.  The muzzles of many guns were rising from the hips.  Joan was pressing the lighted end of the cigarette to the fuse.  A Snider went off with the roar of a bomb-gun, and Sheldon heard a pane of window- glass crash behind him.  At the same moment Joan flung the dynamite, the fuse hissing and spluttering, into the thick of the blacks.  They scattered back in too great haste to do any more shooting.  Satan, aroused by the one shot, was snarling and panting to be let out.  Joan heard, and ran to let him out; and thereat the tragedy was averted, and the comedy began.\\n\\nRifles and spears were dropped or flung aside in a wild scramble for the protection of the cocoanut palms.  Satan multiplied himself.  Never had he been free to tear and rend such a quantity of black flesh before, and he bit and snapped and rushed the flying legs till the last pair were above his head.  All were treed except Telepasse, who was too old and fat, and he lay prone and without movement where he had fallen; while Satan, with too great a heart to worry an enemy that did not move, dashed frantically from tree to tree, barking and springing at those who clung on lowest down.\\n\\n\\\"I fancy you need a lesson or two in inserting fuses,\\\" Sheldon remarked dryly.\\n\\nJoan's eyes were scornful.\\n\\n\\\"There was no detonator on it,\\\" she said.  \\\"Besides, the detonator is not yet manufactured that will explode that charge.  It's only a bottle of chlorodyne.\\\"\\n\\nShe put her fingers into her mouth, and Sheldon winced as he saw her blow, like a boy, a sharp, imperious whistle--the call she always used for her sailors, and that always made him wince.\\n\\n\\\"They're gone up the Balesuna, shooting fish,\\\" he explained.  \\\"But there comes Oleson with his boat's-crew.  He's an old war-horse when he gets started.  See him banging the boys.  They don't pull fast enough for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now what's to be done?\\\" she asked.  \\\"You've treed your game, but you can't keep it treed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No; but I can teach them a lesson.\\\"\\n\\nSheldon walked over to the big bell.\\n\\n\\\"It is all right,\\\" he replied to her gesture of protest.  \\\"My boys are practically all bushmen, while these chaps are salt-water men, and there's no love lost between them.  You watch the fun.\\\"\\n\\nHe rang a general call, and by the time the two hundred labourers trooped into the compound Satan was once more penned in the living- room, complaining to high heaven at his abominable treatment.  The plantation hands were dancing war-dances around the base of every tree and filling the air with abuse and vituperation of their hereditary enemies.  The skipper of the Flibberty-Gibbet arrived in the thick of it, in the first throes of oncoming fever, staggering as he walked, and shivering so severely that he could scarcely hold the rifle he carried.  His face was ghastly blue, his teeth clicked and chattered, and the violent sunshine through which he walked could not warm him.\\n\\n\\\"I'll s-s-sit down, and k-k-keep a guard on 'em,\\\" he chattered. \\\"D-d-dash it all, I always g-get f-fever when there's any excitement.  W-w-wh-what are you going to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gather up the guns first of all.\\\"\\n\\nUnder Sheldon's direction the house-boys and gang-bosses collected the scattered arms and piled them in a heap on the veranda.  The modern rifles, stolen from Lunga, Sheldon set aside; the Sniders he smashed into fragments; the pile of spears, clubs, and tomahawks he presented to Joan.\\n\\n\\\"A really unique addition to your collection,\\\" he smiled; \\\"picked up right on the battlefield.\\\"\\n\\nDown on the beach he built a bonfire out of the contents of the canoes, his blacks smashing, breaking, and looting everything they laid hands on.  The canoes themselves, splintered and broken, filled with sand and coral-boulders, were towed out to ten fathoms of water and sunk.\\n\\n\\\"Ten fathoms will be deep enough for them to work in,\\\" Sheldon said, as they walked back to the compound.\\n\\nHere a Saturnalia had broken loose.  The war-songs and dances were more unrestrained, and, from abuse, the plantation blacks had turned to pelting their helpless foes with pieces of wood, handfuls of pebbles, and chunks of coral-rock.  And the seventy-five lusty cannibals clung stoically to their tree-perches, enduring the rain of missiles and snarling down promises of vengeance.\\n\\n\\\"There'll be wars for forty years on Malaita on account of this,\\\" Sheldon laughed.  \\\"But I always fancy old Telepasse will never again attempt to rush a plantation.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Eh, you old scoundrel,\\\" he added, turning to the old chief, who sat gibbering in impotent rage at the foot of the steps.  \\\"Now head belong you bang 'm too.  Come on, Miss Lackland, bang 'm just once. It will be the crowning indignity.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ugh, he's too dirty.  I'd rather give him a bath.  Here, you, Adamu Adam, give this devil-devil a wash.  Soap and water!  Fill that wash-tub.  Ornfiri, run and fetch 'm scrub-brush.\\\"\\n\\nThe Tahitians, back from their fishing and grinning at the bedlam of the compound, entered into the joke.\\n\\n\\\"Tambo!  Tambo!\\\" shrieked the cannibals from the trees, appalled at so awful a desecration, as they saw their chief tumbled into the tub and the sacred dirt rubbed and soused from his body.\\n\\nJoan, who had gone into the bungalow, tossed down a strip of white calico, in which old Telepasse was promptly wrapped, and he stood forth, resplendent and purified, withal he still spat and strangled from the soap-suds with which Noa Noah had gargled his throat.\\n\\nThe house-boys were directed to fetch handcuffs, and, one by one, the Lunga runaways were haled down out of their trees and made fast.  Sheldon ironed them in pairs, and ran a steel chain through the links of the irons.  Gogoomy was given a lecture for his mutinous conduct and locked up for the afternoon.  Then Sheldon rewarded the plantation hands with an afternoon's holiday, and, when they had withdrawn from the compound, permitted the Port Adams men to descend from the trees.  And all afternoon he and Joan loafed in the cool of the veranda and watched them diving down and emptying their sunken canoes of the sand and rocks.  It was twilight when they embarked and paddled away with a few broken paddles.  A breeze had sprung up, and the Flibberty-Gibbet had already sailed for Lunga to return the runaways.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII--MR. MORGAN AND MR. RAFF\\n\\nSheldon was back in the plantation superintending the building of a bridge, when the schooner Malakula ran in close and dropped anchor. Joan watched the taking in of sail and the swinging out of the boat with a sailor's interest, and herself met the two men who came ashore.  While one of the house-boys ran to fetch Sheldon, she had the visitors served with whisky and soda, and sat and talked with them.\\n\\nThey seemed awkward and constrained in her presence, and she caught first one and then the other looking at her with secret curiosity. She felt that they were weighing her, appraising her, and for the first time the anomalous position she occupied on Berande sank sharply home to her.  On the other hand, they puzzled her.  They were neither traders nor sailors of any type she had known.  Nor did they talk like gentlemen, despite the fact that there was nothing offensive in their bearing and that the veneer of ordinary social nicety was theirs.  Undoubtedly, they were men of affairs-- business men of a sort; but what affairs should they have in the Solomons, and what business on Berande?  The elder one, Morgan, was a huge man, bronzed and moustached, with a deep bass voice and an almost guttural speech, and the other, Raff, was slight and effeminate, with nervous hands and watery, washed-out gray eyes, who spoke with a faint indefinable accent that was hauntingly reminiscent of the Cockney, and that was yet not Cockney of any brand she had ever encountered.  Whatever they were, they were self-made men, she concluded; and she felt the impulse to shudder at thought of falling into their hands in a business way.  There, they would be merciless.\\n\\nShe watched Sheldon closely when he arrived, and divined that he was not particularly delighted to see them.  But see them he must, and so pressing was the need that, after a little perfunctory general conversation, he led the two men into the stuffy office. Later in the afternoon, she asked Lalaperu where they had gone.\\n\\n\\\"My word,\\\" quoth Lalaperu; \\\"plenty walk about, plenty look 'm. Look 'm tree; look 'm ground belong tree; look 'm all fella bridge; look 'm copra-house; look 'm grass-land; look 'm river; look 'm whale-boat--my word, plenty big fella look 'm too much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What fella man them two fella?\\\" she queried.\\n\\n\\\"Big fella marster along white man,\\\" was the extent of his description.\",\"timestamp\":1638930536,\"title\":\"White Mary b'long you bang 'm head,\\\" old Telepasse began again\"},\"digest\":\"5pTgQcjw0UOyN3Kb6V8TrpYDzE3cx7RBAznT1Vo1CiA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3F55F7d8879A09131180614410f6Ba3Af0a49E6d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LO-3oeQWZ-LJ0-c4XwU4M_JDv_sssN3_r0tWkeiqMHY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ah-HLZP4TVZKdJyZHvkDPaPe3KA4Esw-XLQ1rdPrMyE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4-VKAlL1o1DihBshVc4tUsUcFmyHlI0OAyr7lGYpzVZbsO-8xrW7UXoPuwFHqEQFU656VggYf9r6FmehD3NWGg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5ade86db9c4dc0c37556a45f4a567a5a3708c85fcc0ad7e8d61cda77852e171a49760eefe0da90b76d31a60973654db8c6130826499a82c811bb6a1f2e7908c61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LO-3oeQWZ-LJ0-c4XwU4M_JDv_sssN3_r0tWkeiqMHY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ah-HLZP4TVZKdJyZHvkDPaPe3KA4Esw-XLQ1rdPrMyE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5pTgQcjw0UOyN3Kb6V8TrpYDzE3cx7RBAznT1Vo1CiA\"}"
