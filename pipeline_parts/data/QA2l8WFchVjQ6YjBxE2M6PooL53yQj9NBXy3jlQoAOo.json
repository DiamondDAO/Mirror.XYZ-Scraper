"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### Abstract\\n\\n*Since 2009, The blockchain world and cryptocurrency fields are been developed rapidly, FinTech and on-chain assets become bigger and bigger trendy in each wave of the crypto assets bull. Similar to the immigration in America since several hundred years ago, the settlers are looking for a new world to give them better lives, not to suffer anymore from abuses and difficulties in the old world. Although the blockchain world is still very small compare with the traditional fiat-based system, the regulation is still not fully completed, and still many illegal activities are using cryptocurrency to escape the regulation, but we believe that this blockchain new world will grow to a mature system in the coming decades, just as normal as of today’s gold and securities market.*\\n\\nIn 1620, the ship Mayflower brought the early well-known settlers to the new continent, America, the motivation of them is to leave the abuses from England, quit the backbreaking jobs, make a change of increasing difficulty of their lives when they were in holland. Nearly 400 years passed, 12 years after Satoshi Nakamoto published the paper of a peer-to-peer payment system, many of the new generations aren’t able to find another new world physically, but in another way, some of them are moving their assets to the “blockchain world”, a digital, virtual and free new world.\\n\\nEven though the world had prosperity for a long period, the traditional fiat system is facing more and more difficulty in debts and huge money supply, in 2020, QE was been used again by Federal Reserve in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, its balance sheet has grown to $7 trillion on May.18.2020, this number used to be only $4.16 trillion in Feb.2020, the QE might be further used by Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy in the next times of crisis. QEs is one of the factors that cause the gaps between the rich and the poor to be even larger in recent decades, the rich always has stocks of top companies, real-estate in big cities which those “two infrastructures” could help to grow more wealth as fast as possible, the bottom-half people who have much less or without the “two infrastructure” are getting more difficult to build or keep their wealth with current fiat system, go to the “blockchain world” could be a new option.\\n\\nTo enter the “blockchain world”, the user must have “another two infrastructures”, Bitcoin which could be compared with gold, and Ethereum, which is more likely to become the robust infrastructure for the banks and exchanges in the “blockchain world”. Between 2009 and 2018, the whole blockchain assets already experienced huge volatility, then similar situation happened in May.2021, but now the users can hedge that risk for the leading blockchain assets such as the two infrastructures above and the stablecoins (the value equal to mainstream fiats), the leading DeFi (Decentralized Finance) platforms already provided easy tools to long and short the mainstream blockchain assets, DeFi platforms have no middle-man to takeaway more fees and they are also more flexible than the centralized crypto exchanges who are been existed earlier, currently, the value of the locked assets in top 3 DeFi lending platforms have reached 11.4 billion USD, who are just launched around 2018.\\n\\nThe migration from “the traditional fiat world” to “the blockchain world” is getting easier, in multiple countries which already announced related regulations, more and more fiat-based banks and payment platforms launched new services which allow clients to trade and deposit mainstream blockchain assets. Not only the fiat-based finance institutes are make changing, but KOLs in social media also aren’t able to keep silent, lots of KOLs in technology, media, and telecom fields talked about or even make endorsements to the blockchain field during the bulls of 2017 and 2020.\\n\\nOf course, the controversy surrounding the blockchain field hasn’t been stopped since 2009 when it was born, such as the high volatility, not easy to use and understand for the users who lack IT skills, but new technology or new field always grow with multi-wave of controversy, just as internet, smartphone and even electronic auto which are obviously quite normal today. Each bull and bear circle will let the “The blockchain world” be a more mature system, thus, focusing on the macro trend will be important than the up or down in short term. Blockchain assets might not replace the traditional fiat system, but it shall able to be a new option for the modern internet of value, a better way for people to keep valuable assets, and a milestone for the business.\\n\\nReference:\\n\\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower>\\n\\n<https://www.thebalance.com/what-is-quantitative-easing-definition-and-explanation-3305881>\\n\\n<http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data/money-supply-charts>\\n\\n<https://take-profit.org/en/statistics/money-supply-m1/united-states/>\\n\\n<https://dailycaller.com/2021/04/20/king-income-inequality-endangers-america/>\\n\\n<https://etherscan.io/defi#defi-leaderboard>\",\"timestamp\":1636027677,\"title\":\"The big migration of assets to the new “blockchain world”\"},\"digest\":\"o95Ruw2VYnP_agOfOGlQgCwMnOzdqfQ5YDUBAl7CEn0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3019e08A3b5E9F94d3c9832881e0ec123803b8EE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"43bJgCgRVD1p4joPv5rrFQBU8afUQ_QV9HINAd80C5A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OYbmze4I15AIII9-uaEYhhFuO0J8cjLdn98Yyg9fEpk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"akiPV-svV7xTt5JldR1_bk5A4uvPVyd-V4hcUkz7gRJTJ2lQCboc8TnWAMqrkgmcZ3DHcASYXsYgR2JqdRep4g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf7c95833bd149d7dc4d3c2f30d7d7648eea4699d503e25744ebddfbd722aa98038c8f3e97132a1e439b107c6ab124e3badd0310175ec128d3404ec11ec458e361c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"43bJgCgRVD1p4joPv5rrFQBU8afUQ_QV9HINAd80C5A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"OYbmze4I15AIII9-uaEYhhFuO0J8cjLdn98Yyg9fEpk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"o95Ruw2VYnP_agOfOGlQgCwMnOzdqfQ5YDUBAl7CEn0\"}"
