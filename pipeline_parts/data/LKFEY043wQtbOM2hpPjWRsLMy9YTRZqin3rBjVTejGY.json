"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Fractals, bullish technical analysis patterns and the fact that 67% of the total supply is staked are key reasons why analysts expect ATOM to hit new highs shortly.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8qO1JA9xFyGVVJMuzFK-J.png?height=782&width=1174)\\n\\nCosmos ([ATOM](https://cointelegraph.com/cosmos-price-index)) has the potential to record major gains in the upcoming weeks primarily because its longer-timeframe chart is showing a bullish continuation pattern. \\n\\nDubbed \\\"[bull flag](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-metric-demands-strong-reaction-as-56k-btc-starts-to-look-seriously-cheap),\\\" the structure appears as the asset trends lower while bouncing between two downward sloping trendlines. However, it eventually breaks out of the range, in the direction of its previous trend, with a profit target at length equal to the size of its previous uptrend, which is also known as the flagpole.\\n\\n![ATOM/USD weekly price chart featuring Bull Flag setup.

This sets a price target near $65 as when measured from the current potential breakout point.\\n\\n## Nearly 64% of ATOM's total supply is staked\\n\\nThe bullish setup in ATOM appeared as the [token rose over 330%](https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-luna-atom-xtz-axs) from its June low at $7.82 to this week's swing high near $32.\\n\\nCirculating token scarcity could be playing a role in driving buyers into the market. Data fetched by Messari [showed](https://messari.io/asset/cosmos/metrics/staking) that nearly 64% of the current ATOM supply is staked.\\n\\n![ATOM staking data.

In return, users receive a portion of the network transaction fees and block rewards.\\n\\nPentoshi, an independent market analyst, [noted](https://twitter.com/Pentosh1/status/1466629898512965632) that the rising number of staked ATOM tokens have been instrumental in pushing its price upward.\\n\\nThe pseudonymous Twitterati added that ATOM sellers have been losing momentum, citing two corrections during the fourth quarter that got stopped midway due to a higher buying pressure near the token's previous all-time high levels.\\n\\n![ATOM/USD daily price chart by Pentoshi.

In a similar setup, [AVAX rallied by nearly 250%](https://cointelegraph.com/news/avalanche-ecosystem-accelerator-raises-18-5m-in-seed-funding) after finding a solid footing inside the $50 to $60 support area.\\n\\n![ATOM/USD vs AVAX/USD daily price chart by Bluntz.
