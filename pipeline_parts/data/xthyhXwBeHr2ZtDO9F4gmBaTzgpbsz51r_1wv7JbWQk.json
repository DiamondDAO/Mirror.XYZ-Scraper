First and foremost, our native stablecoins and NOM tokens will be natively tradeable on the ONET, but cross-chain integrations through bi-directional bridges are already underway, including any Cosmos-enabled and EVM-based chains, as well as Polkadot, Cardano, Avalanche, Solana, and others.\\n\\nFor the first iteration of our testnet, our primary objectives are to successfully test the Onomy Network, the Onomy — ETH bridge, and conduct a public test of the Bonding Curve platform.\\n\\n## **Call for Validators**\\n\\nValidators joining our first public testnet are encouraged to report findings and share feedback, in preparation for the ONET’s mainnet launch. This testnet is also focused on proving out the Gravity bridge as well as deployment methodology and other custom modules for the upcoming production ONET.\\n\\n## **Why Join Us?**\\n\\nThe primary network security of the ONET is assured by a Proof of Stake model that bonds NOM to validators either by the validators themselves or through delegation. Network security depends on the bonding to create both incentives for good behavior and disincentives for bad behavior. Staked NOM may not be used to mint new Denoms while staked, but will receive staking rewards. Primary staking rewards are given based on a dual-regime model with an initial hyper-inflationary period followed by an indefinite stabilization period with a goal of 50% of NOM staked with nodes.\\n\\nThe hyper-inflationary curve is based on the Irwin-Hall distribution. This is a polynomial analog to the familiar exponential type “bell curves”. The goal of the hyper-inflationary period is to build a strong network by heavily loading inflation for early adopters that participate in staking.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*7GWbRUfhmboMENv20UtvPA.png)\\n\\n## **How to Join the Testnet**\\n\\nFor testnet documentation and joining guides, kindly head over to our [GitHub testnet repo](https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy/tree/dev/docs/testnet), where you can find details on:\\n\\n*   [**How to run a full testnet node**](https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy/blob/dev/docs/testnet/onomy-testnet-docs/setting-up-a-fullnode.md)\\n*   [**How to become a validator**](https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy/blob/dev/docs/testnet/onomy-testnet-docs/setting-up-a-validator.md)\\n*   [**Accessing the Testnet Faucet**](https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy/blob/dev/docs/testnet/onomy-testnet-docs/faucet.md)\\n*   [**Testing the Onomy Network through Gravity**](https://github.com/onomyprotocol/onomy/blob/dev/docs/testnet/onomy-testnet-docs/testing-gravity.md)\\n\\nFor focused discussions with other validators, support from the Onomy development team, networking, and feedback, kindly join our [Discord Validators Server](https://discord.gg/ge7Rt9hdpa) and [Validator Forum](https://forum.onomy.io/).\\n\\n## **Understanding NOM, the Proof of Stake Token**\\n\\nNOM serves as the single collateral to our fiat-pegged stablecoins and is the go-to token for PoS staking, while granting governance rights and rewarding those who support the network.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*flIbKeSD\\\\_-yYw5HeZsxgbA.png)\\n\\n## **About Onomy Protocol**\\n\\nOnomy Protocol is the financial infrastructure converging CeFi with DeFi. Users may easily mint, trade, and lend stablecoins across prominent blockchain economies, in a highly scalable, secure, and efficient process, plugging the $6.6T per day Forex market into DeFi. We’re also building a hybrid DEX employing both AMM & order book models for advanced and intuitive trading of cryptocurrencies, NOM, and Onomy’s stablecoins.\\n\\nTo learn more about Onomy Protocol and our goals, kindly read our [Litepaper](https://onomy.io/docs/litepaper-0521.pdf), [CoinMarketCap deep tech dive](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-onomy-protocol), and [Medium](https://medium.com/onomy-protocol).\\n\\n— —\\n\\n[Website](https://onomy.io/) |[ Litepaper](https://onomy.io/docs/litepaper-0521.pdf) |[ Twitter](https://twitter.com/onomyprotocol) |[ Discord](https://discord.gg/eMkh9bvTpS) |[Telegram](https://t.me/onomyprotocol)|[ GitHub](https://github.com/onomyprotocol) |[ Documentation](https://docs.onomy.io/)\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640875518,\"title\":\"Announcing the Onomy Network (ONET) Public Testnet - Onomy Protocol - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"AWbcDhdZC44TZs4S5D9eRt2lVi9V1vAdQg-8FZxKx4s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2ff74049304739bf5020D14258f24A47b54C407B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E5mPRBxHRMzHkbhdhNaUoNPauRNVI7m2o7pPgqwoQ-k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ACdXVqjGw98ipKtkwJPTUJZQY2fBAQKnFr-kv-HhMDE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"xZ1qE-zoD-k3dfm-bLo9DF0WHpsm6U9OIzMr6ji2p3x59xT-L2TCfPAiXTIMIYa5ALWgs9vh2kALQejmFKe-6A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2378149f40d77d2a0b85e9caa8bd4a95fe1626bd0c45b8bee767c9cc0f0d48e7755b29dee7328aec26a134d7e84940eb2c96e49a31be8c3f6d7320aa8a3a957e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"E5mPRBxHRMzHkbhdhNaUoNPauRNVI7m2o7pPgqwoQ-k\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ACdXVqjGw98ipKtkwJPTUJZQY2fBAQKnFr-kv-HhMDE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AWbcDhdZC44TZs4S5D9eRt2lVi9V1vAdQg-8FZxKx4s\"}"
