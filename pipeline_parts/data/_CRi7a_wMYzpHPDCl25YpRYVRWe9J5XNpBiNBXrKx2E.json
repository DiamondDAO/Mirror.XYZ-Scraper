"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Listen up, $LUNA-tics!\\n\\nHere’s a game-changer for onboarding the masses: Yotta Savings.\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nBecause it utilizes Anchor Protocol and UST to bring a high-yielding savings product to normies.\\n\\nHow does it work? Well, that’s what we will be reviewing in this article.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### What is Yotta Savings?\\n\\nTo start, I should explain what Yotta is. I was first put onto Yotta about a year before I starting digging into Terra.\\n\\nYotta is FinTech aimed at making saving FUN. They spell it out pretty well in their own words here:\\n\\n> Yotta was founded to help Americans become more financially secure. According to the Federal Reserve, 40% of Americans can’t come up with $400 in an emergency. This leaves almost half the country in a financially vulnerable position.‍\\n\\n> Even though 40% of Americans struggle to save, Americans spend $80 billion on the lottery every year, or $640 per household on average. The lottery is the worst bet you can make — only 50% of what’s put in is paid out.\\n\\n> So if the lottery is such a sub-optimal financial decision and saving is so important, why do people under-save and over-spend on the lottery? Because saving is boring. There’s no short-term reward. On the other hand, the lottery provides immediate hope, excitement, and fun.\\n\\nSo, how do they mend the gap between fun and savings?\\n\\nThey’ve created a lottery-based savings app that pays more than double the national banking average on your savings. PLUS, for every $25 you have saved in your account, you are granted one weekly lottery ticket!\\n\\nThat means if you have $400 saved in your account, you get 16 lottery tickets each week — for FREE!\\n\\nNot only that, but there are no account fees and it is all FDIC-insured. How awesome, right!?\\n\\nPlus, they can make a hell of a brand explainer **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAFvO7GlZp4)**.\\n\\nI *love* the concept Yotta has laid out. I’m a huge fan. But how does it all tie in with Terra blockchain’s mass adoption? Read on. . .\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n### How Yotta is an Easy Sell to Normies Entering the Crypto Space\\n\\nYou might have a friend or brother or random stranger on the Internet who is interested in learning about the Terra blockchain from you.\\n\\nIf you struggle to explain crypto concepts as much as me, something like Anchor Protocol is a tough sell to someone who has a zero-knowledge base about crypto.\\n\\nThe idea of decentralized finance is fun, but spelling it out in an easy-to-understand way isn’t so much. Luckily, we have Yotta as a bridge to the DeFi world.\\n\\nInstead of spelling it out and answering all of the questions that come with it, it will be much easier to put that person onto Yotta Savings.\\n\\nShow them the video linked above and tell them it’s the same deal for crypto savings except with 5x the allotted lottery tickets.\\n\\nThat’s right — you get a weekly recurring lottery ticket for every $5 you save in Yotta’s ‘Crypto Buckets’.\\n\\nIn theory, using this type of onboarding, your friend or brother or random stranger on the Internet can help grow Terra’s ecosystem without ever knowing what a ‘stablecoin’ is.\\n\\n**How?**\\n\\nYotta has partnered with Anchor Protocol to bring high-yield crypto savings to normies at a much better rate of return than the fiat savings accounts on Yotta.\\n\\nAt an **8% implied APY average**, the beloved normie in your life will be thrilled to take the leap into crypto.\\n\\nThis isn’t a guaranteed rate; he/she can either earn a better rate or a worse rate depending on their luck. But winners are chosen at random and fairly on Yotta. And there are many winners each week! Your winnings should average out to be about 8% APY on your savings.\\n\\nThat sure sounds fun!\\n\\nOf course, as dedicated LUNAtics, we know 8% is just a fraction of what Anchor Protocol can produce in terms of yield (20% APY), but to any normie, 8% is miraculous! Considering banks nowadays are paying less than 0.5% on your savings. Not to mention, it is a hell of a lot easier as Yotta takes care of everything on the crypto side in the backend.\\n\\nThe normie in your life won’t even realize they are dealing in crypto because everything in the front-end will appear as USD. Brilliant!
