"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Among the problems we face, I think povertyis the biggest problem. My reasons are as follows.\\n\\nTo begin with, there are still many peopledying of starvation in many poor countries. They don't have enough food, forthey have no money. It's no doubt that eating unhealthily will result inillness. What's more, people in these undeveloped areas usually lack of properhealth care. Thus, infectious diseases like AIDS spreads fast. That isterrible.\\n\\nIn addition, their clothes are too worn tobe called \\\"clothes\\\", and thus many of them are frozen to death. The littlematch girl in Andersen's fairy tale is just a case in point. Such a problem ismostly caused by lack of money, in other word, poverty.\\n\\nFrom over above we can safely draw aconclusion that poverty is the biggest problem in Earth.\",\"timestamp\":1639204849,\"title\":\"My View on Proverty\"},\"digest\":\"jC-8mAqgchfJb3IxoM6mCVSRxLyMgAmnmakkZNkEHfQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdc309a3652fCeC3F15B5FA5e020c5EA636AC93e3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jpi2Sw48okbdo-Aq0ONZQjYPsKKdGkBzxrvvTNYneuA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0XWRQB9zJmLo0TchPPhkW2z-uN3GdgULAR3WiWvywJM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"AsUSr-_eIEAyZf_f19u5QlsSz7RgH-pS0guJkyclQdqM-Ynf6nhypHqdRKjCtKWEhV4qfi28S7_xE4TFQ_afTg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa2a0e1b56e7ca77714fa82fcfbd2cc0fa3688b4594c38c78bf0dfe0516faa3476ad3b0d045a47183e6d22098d25a983b4b7afae4aadcf2bf4980cea15b89b2ac1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jpi2Sw48okbdo-Aq0ONZQjYPsKKdGkBzxrvvTNYneuA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"0XWRQB9zJmLo0TchPPhkW2z-uN3GdgULAR3WiWvywJM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jC-8mAqgchfJb3IxoM6mCVSRxLyMgAmnmakkZNkEHfQ\"}"
