"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Many people want to become rich, and when they see the rich go to play golf, they also go to play. They saw the rich send their children to private schools, and they also sent their children in. They saw the rich buying luxury cars, and they also borrowed money to buy luxury cars. They saw the rich buying luxury houses, and they also bought luxury houses for freight forwarders.\\n\\nThey think that what the rich do, what they do, what the rich have, and what they have, they will be rich.\\n\\nDon't you know that painting a tiger is not an anti-dog. I am still a poor man, even worse. This is a typical Dongshi effect.\\n\\nJust like some people, if they want to be healthy, they buy fitness cards and fitness equipment. At the beginning, they feel fresh and control their food. Go to the gym several times, but insist on not going there for a short time and start to eat and drink. , At home sitting on the sofa and watching TV. As a result, the body quickly went out of shape.\\n\\nWanting to be healthy is not a matter of controlling food and buying fitness cards. It's a question of healthy thoughts and concepts. The question of good living habits.\\n\\nJust as many people see other people meeting beauties in high-end bars and meeting beautiful girls in five-star hotels, he also goes to high-end bars and five-star hotels to meet beautiful women, thinking that so can he.\\n\\nIn fact, the fundamental problem is his own quality, whether he has the financial foundation, and whether his conversation can be managed to communicate with these beauties.\\n\\nMany people want to be rich. We shouldn’t learn how the rich buy luxury cars, mansions, and all the behaviors of the rich. Instead, we should understand the true meaning of wealth from the ideological and conceptual level.\\n\\nIf you have the ideas and concepts of the poor or the middle class, but do what the rich do\\n\\n92 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nThings, then you can only have what the poor or the middle class have.\\n\\nTwo simple sentences indicate how to become a rich man: learning management and finance, knowledge of economics is\\n\\nThe fastest way to become rich. At least, you can know exactly how the game of money is played.\\n\\nWithout the precipitation of knowledge, even if you win a lottery, you can only be a nouveau riche, and you can't hold onto your wealth.\\nThe awesome people are nothing great, but they are familiar with them.\\n\\nEvery awesome person you see is nothing remarkable, the only difference is that he is more skilled.\\n\\nhow to explain? When I was a kid, there was a text in the Chinese textbook of junior high school called \\\"Selling Oil Weng\\\" and there was a man named Chen Kangsu who was very good at archery. Once, when he was shooting arrows in his home garden, an old oil seller put down his burden and stood aside, looking at him disapprovingly. Will not leave for a long time. The old man saw Chen Kangsu shoot 10 arrows, 9 arrows could be shot, but the old man's face did not show any admiration, he just nodded slightly.\\n\\nChen Kangsu was upset, so he asked the old man: \\\"You can shoot arrows? Isn't my archery good?\\\" The old man said, \\\"There is nothing great, it's just a skillful hand!\\\" Chen Kangsu roared very angrily: \\\"Even if you are an old man who sells oil, you dare to despise my martial arts of archery?\\\" The old man said, \\\"With my experience in pouring oil, you can understand that you are nothing great.\\\" So the old man took a gourd and placed it on the ground. Then he took out a copper coin with the outer circle and the inner square to cover the mouth of the gourd, and slowly poured the oil into the gourd with a spoon. The oil was poured into the hole in the middle of the coin, but the coin did not get wet. The old man said, \\\"I'm not great at this point, but I'm very familiar with it.\\\" That is just because of the result of my daily practice. Chen Kangsu suddenly lost his confidence. He suddenly realized that he was good at archery and there was nothing to show off, so he had to send the old man away with a smile.\\n\\nThis \\\"experienced hand\\\" of the oil seller has always been my highest pursuit of doing business, speaking, managing the team, and doing business. In fact, a good person in this society has a skill that you admire very much. You don't need to envy him at all. Just because he practices every day, he will naturally excel. Many people look down on the old routines, look down on practicing those common skills every day. This is a misunderstanding. Becoming the top person is because this person practices basic skills every day. What is a genius? People with extremely solid basic skills. That is, you are only familiar with it! Only by familiarity can you guarantee that you can hit 9 arrows when you shoot 10 arrows.\\n\\nIn fact, in our mixed society, we only need to practice one set of things and become familiar with them. Some people look down on them, saying that you only know one set, ignore them, and continue to practice your own set. Because the two sets are not refined. Don't see how simple other people's routines are, you just won't. If you pour the oil in the same way as the oil seller, you won't be able to pour it in. If you follow Liu Xiang's routine to hurdle, you can't run so fast. Therefore, each of us must practice our own routines and practice them well. To be familiar, you have to practice only one routine in your life.\\n\\nSomeone asked again, you only have one routine. If you encounter other problems, what should you do if your routine cannot be solved? I said, can't you leave some questions to other people in the team? The more people who don’t know anything, the more they worry about what if there are things in this world that I don’t know how to do? Once a person really knows one thing, it is all in his eyes, and he doesn't bother to care about other things.\\n\\nUse this idea to guide your own life and practice your core competitiveness. You will grow up very fast. There is no one great in this world, but they have practiced for a long time, you can do it too, you can only be familiar with it!\",\"timestamp\":1634795407,\"title\":\"You have to be rich first before you can do the things of the rich and have the rich\\n\\nHuman stuff\"},\"digest\":\"poSAd6qLNgnpG8-UdDCcVr4zG_m6_F8MasNQpF7WGqc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"tHdlwt8EsZ0yMpqmAuXzdZ3Buq9GX48xzRpFAruiLTpa9iGXz0MvGaVbY6LQqrRpnrhgShFBylR_emYdUQIrYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"poSAd6qLNgnpG8-UdDCcVr4zG_m6_F8MasNQpF7WGqc\"}"
