"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"A [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/) is a network of distinct physical locations tied together by shared governance and culture. They allow people to maintain close social ties and norms while moving around to different places. They also create robustness against local changes in climate, regulation, and social norms.\\n\\nInspired by Balaji's essay on [The Location Stack](https://1729.com/location/) for technological progressives and conversations at Creator Cabins this past week, we've been thinking through a rough sketch of the full tech stack for decentralized cities:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c9eff57a-48ee-4e01-bce5-6a71e784d038.jpeg?height=1725&width=1307)\\n\\nLike a computer, a decentralized city has hardware and software. Hardware is the physical space: the land, the infrastructure, and the buildings. Software is the virtual layer: incorporation, governance, and social interaction. \\n\\nThis separation allows decentralized cities to operate with compatible and interchangeable hardware and software architectures. If a physical node in the network doesn't agree with decisions being made, they can spin up a new virtual governance layer. And if a physical location becomes an untenable place to continue living, the community can migrate to a new location without losing their social and governance layers. \\n\\nBy decoupling these functions, everyone has a plausible [path to exit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit,_Voice,_and_Loyalty) and try something different. You can imagine that virtual \\\"governments\\\" would gain and lose physical locations over time, and that physical locations could be part of multiple social and governance layers, depending on their needs:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/49e05c2c-07d5-44b5-9038-803cac2a07ab.png?height=1099&width=1704)\\n\\n\\n## Hardware for a decentralized city\\n\\nThere are three layers of the physical hardware stack:\\n\\n1. Land\\n2. Infrastructure\\n3. Buildings\\n\\n### Land: Develop multiple exurban locations\\n\\nWhile the metaverse will increase our time spent in virtual realities, we still need to live in good old-fashioned physical reality. And if you want to be able to control your physical space, you need to own land.\\n\\nWhile decentralized cities need land, a key difference that separates them from conventional cities is that the land isn't all in one place. Multiple physical nodes in the network allow flexibility and a plausible path to exit from any specific location. \\n\\nWhere should these nodes be located? The best living locations through quality-of-life factors like:\\n\\n- Cost: housing, food, taxes...\\n- Environment: climate, access to nature...\\n- Infrastructure: internet speed, airports, healthcare...\\n- Culture: access to dining, museums, concerts...\\n- Regulation: the ability to build, experiment...\\n\\nWe believe that exurban environments provide the best trade-off among these factors for decentralized cities. They have relatively low costs and regulations and provide access to both nature and urban areas.\\n\\nUnincorporated areas approximately 30 minutes - 1 hour outside of core urban areas seem to be ideal. For example, we've located the first Creator Cabins location in an exurban sweet spot, out in nature but only 45 minutes from downtown Austin:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ac2d734f-8a1d-4e38-9f59-c8c59639f090.jpg?height=1512&width=1926)\\n\\n\\n### Infrastructure: Go off-grid \\n\\nTo build a robust decentralized city node, off-the-grid technologies make up the core infrastructure tech stack. Solar panels, fixed wireless or satellite internet, a well, and a septic system can provide for an entirely independent retreat. Here are some pictures of our infra set-up:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5085a095-c5d9-4873-b302-035da188e624.jpg?height=1333&width=1961)\\n\\nThere are probably several whole posts to be written about lessons learned putting in our infrastructure. But generally speaking, these technologies have gotten good enough that you can create a functioning outpost on your own infrastructure nearly anywhere in the world. With the proliferation of 5G and Starlink, internet access will soon be very fast in most places. \\n\\n\\n### Buildings: design for community and flexibility\\n\\nThe physical buildings should be suited to the target citizens of your decentralized city. We recommend [A Pattern Language](https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199) as a guide to the principles of spatial design of physical communities. In our case, we designed our new cabin from the ground up for creator co-living and working. It features private bedroom suites with built-in desks and large connected public areas for social interaction and collaboration: \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/e626a4ec-2085-4f7c-910e-c8ee2d05120f.png?height=1708&width=2462)\\n\\nWe partnered with [Forte Shelter](https://www.forteshelter.com/) to pre-fabricate this cabin out of shipping containers. It's an inherently modular and extensible design. While pre-fab construction is not a panacea, it also allows the flexibility to install similar cabins anywhere in the world and move existing cabins to new locations if needed:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/11103b3b-578b-46f0-914f-4cab39355273.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\\n\\nOther flexible living options like [Kibbo](https://www.kibbo.com/) could allow for even easier migration of living spaces. Chenoe Hart has written about [the ways in which self-driving technology may blur the lines between vehicles and buildings](https://reallifemag.com/perpetual-motion-machines/). \\n\\n\\n## Software for a decentralized city\\n\\nDecentralized cities run on three primary layers of the software stack:\\n\\n1. Incorporation\\n2. Governance\\n3. Social\\n\\n### Remote incorporation\\n\\nIn Balaji's Location Stack post, he asks for . We assume others will provide much better summaries...one example...\\n\\nBut we believe that eventually decentralized cities can be governed primarily on-chain, and local regulations . \\n\\nTraditionally, cities are in a single place and are incorporated locally. But much like startups now incorporate in Delaware regardless of where they do business, cities may start to incorporate in one place and then do business in many places. Wyoming creating a legal structure for DAOs makes it a compelling option for city incorporation. \\n\\nThis could actually work elegantly within the existing structures of American federalism. The idea of powers left to local governing bodies is core to the structure of the US Constitution. \\n\\nBut if local governance isn't tied to a single location, where does it happen? On-chain.\\n\\n\\n### On-chain governance\\n\\nBlockchains are a natural fit for decentralized city governance. They allow for open access, transportability, and a permanent and inalterable historical record.\\n\\nOne of my favorite characters of Texas history is [Angelina Eberly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Eberly), an innkeeper who protected Texas' government records with a cannon when Sam Houston (then the president of Texas) tried to forcibly relocate the state capital from Austin to his namesake town of Houston. There's a statue to honor her near the capitol in downtown Austin:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/b6a9b444-019a-475e-920f-0f0c39e60ca2.jpg?height=912&width=1600)\\n\\nThe [Texas Archive War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Archive_War), as it was called, isn't possible when the governance records are located on a blockchain. **Anyone can look at the records at any time from anywhere, and no one can change them.**\\n\\nWe are experimenting with this at Creator Cabins by launching CabinDAO, [a token-based governance structure for funding and awarding creator residencies at our cabins](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/crowdfunded-creator-residencies/). Stay tuned for our $CABIN crowdfund on Mirror later this week!\\n\\n\\n### Off-chain social communication\\n\\noff-chain discussion, votes, content, recruiting...\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621818743,\"title\":\"Tech stack for decentralized cities\",\"publication\":\"creators\"},\"digest\":\"u9mN4Q1zVslSa_ODfleTXbI9dCjVB2_YZknRvBr8dhU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xbeC26FFa12c90217943D1b2958f60A821aE6E549\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZDlhJZQ0hfXSwgFy_dldmR9lmjEnSewfmEsE1XIpgoo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fo5VrP3ivmMtUHGkrqg5ImpKZqPoeeetwH99a8BNKgY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_DefjLEX2xQ9szFEYocaDdnwz3JWP8myUfrxGv3SnrYPf3zaKauMoKBW_irRnePqgNv6a8v7nblnf8JGGlDRlQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcbd55f06c62b374c175099440348482da59dd6a25a3982c3eb9f8a4b42d8561f168efdfb659c4a68a548db9035d89eea96fc23d65a053ee4e8e8fbdf31c5361c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on creators.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ZDlhJZQ0hfXSwgFy_dldmR9lmjEnSewfmEsE1XIpgoo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"fo5VrP3ivmMtUHGkrqg5ImpKZqPoeeetwH99a8BNKgY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4\"}"
