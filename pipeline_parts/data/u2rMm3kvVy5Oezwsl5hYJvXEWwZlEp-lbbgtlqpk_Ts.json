"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hello, everyone! I am starting a small experiment to help improve my writing and communication skills, two things that I have constantly wanted to work on. Thanks for tuning in!\\n\\n### Who are you?\\n\\nI am Jeremy, a recent graduate and working at a startup called [On Deck](https://www.beondeck.com/). I am a first-generation immigrant that grew up in sunny Southern California. I tend to have bursts of interests here and there but most relate to technology, art, or history. Currently, I am sort of nomadic after finishing school, traveling to different cities for a few weeks each month (COVID willing). Outside of those things, I love to read all sorts of books in my free time and try different foods/cuisines. I'm sure you will learn more about me as I write more regularly so I'll save some of the more interesting stuff for later :).\\n\\n### So what exactly will you be writing about?\\n\\nAnything that comes to mind can be probably in the following forms or a mix of them:\\n\\n* Thoughts and opinions on current events or trends\\n* What's going on in my life and what are some things that I am thinking through\\n* Interesting articles and/or websites to visit\\n* Deep dives into topics that I'm interested in\\n* Creative writing (poetry, prose, anything I want to express)\\n\\nAs I write more, I will get a better sense of what structure I want to keep or change up each post. I hope to publish every two weeks but I can't promise that. For this post, I'll keep it short with some current questions that I have been pondering.\\n\\n1. At what point, can an individual call themselves an expert or skilled in a craft?\\n2. Is there a cycle of unbundling and re-bundling popular things (i.e. tv → streaming services → to streaming bundles)?\\n3. What is the history of flowers and \\\"domesticating\\\" them as a gift?\\n\\nhere’s a haiku \\n\\n### warmth\\n\\nanxious and distraught\\n\\nher porcelain skin met mine\\n\\nrelaxed and at peace\\n\\nsee you soon \",\"timestamp\":1633821874,\"title\":\"Blog Post 1 \"},\"digest\":\"zSXDddPh2qjoWBIejYNJQZpzM-tsu2F-OBf5t7paSFs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xFC17dD364f6C6162E677813122dc9816936c3fDF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"AJeo0X536pmrPvFiPZISGxtT25JjbkbbRTRp8KdLM6E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L22wHzAL7qVg0kaDYtyqwBxt8ii1A7x9PwpTcbHQ2cw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TsJjqbWD3UlGNSAcUoCv-YzLuX3NSUgmEvOUnylVS_YVbcj34RQy9Lo1Y9_1aczgEIoTJLUoEkIZTVyykiKDww\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4dc27f690a75fc45786b071c4038c5ce095484b28b974537c3ea3bca3b4df60d079567ef15dd27cd4e3f80a77bc9926c73d281a2f75d37fe06c64597187bfd4b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"AJeo0X536pmrPvFiPZISGxtT25JjbkbbRTRp8KdLM6E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L22wHzAL7qVg0kaDYtyqwBxt8ii1A7x9PwpTcbHQ2cw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"zSXDddPh2qjoWBIejYNJQZpzM-tsu2F-OBf5t7paSFs\"}"
