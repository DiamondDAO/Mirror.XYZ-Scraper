"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> As a SysOps Administrator, you have been asked to fix the network performance issues for a fleet of Amazon EC2 instances of a company.\\n>\\n> Which of the following use-cases represents the right fit for using enhanced networking?\\n\\n**Ref:**\\n\\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html)\\n\\n[https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/enable-configure-enhanced-networking/](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/enable-configure-enhanced-networking/)\\n\\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-volumes-multi.html)\\n\\n**Ans:**\\n\\n**To support throughput near or exceeding 20K packets per second (PPS) on the VIF driver** - Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.\\n\\nConsider using enhanced networking for the following scenarios:\\n\\n1. If your packets-per-second rate reaches its ceiling, consider moving to enhanced networking. If your rate reaches its ceiling, you've likely reached the upper thresholds of the virtual network interface driver.\\n2. If your throughput is near or exceeding 20K packets per second (PPS) on the VIF driver, it's a best practice to use enhanced networking.\\n\\nAll current generation instance types support enhanced networking, except for T2 instances.\",\"timestamp\":1641307502,\"title\":\"[Web 2][AWS] EC2 enhanced networking\"},\"digest\":\"RvuMPDA9LJwC4kpjXRtuvVfW3Qcr_cHvgo39mDXNhro\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd0368eE169498faad1AF9aBFbdC8C9CAE432aBe5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BEsnhfd1DkMbOlZ4HfBQZmBmbzM9-wLJnhivFRpydP0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kIztSFJ6BfDUg3JD89g0RIFYZ25Au0U5MSyg4Bb1KcI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BwxGK3mhSrRdtEH1qYfjLbKtHxKVtgbQXKfgWND0OhciGcnsm9riJ9tNgqVPqXxe91UjH0vP4leWbHDztm73nw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xce4ff89d77bbf6971dbe18d682a15f33c5095aad10718caa6f04339b5d1ec16f2ef845c3723a780509308ba22876d40fa5114045bf244d200de3342f53cfd3351b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BEsnhfd1DkMbOlZ4HfBQZmBmbzM9-wLJnhivFRpydP0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kIztSFJ6BfDUg3JD89g0RIFYZ25Au0U5MSyg4Bb1KcI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"RvuMPDA9LJwC4kpjXRtuvVfW3Qcr_cHvgo39mDXNhro\"}"
