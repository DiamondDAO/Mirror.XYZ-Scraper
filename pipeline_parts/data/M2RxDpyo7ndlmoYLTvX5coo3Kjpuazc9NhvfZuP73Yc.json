Free City will play a unique role too. With our vibrant united community, Free City is now heading towards building an even greater Community, a DAO Governed ecosystem, a Multi Chain NFT marketplace and an eventual future Game + web3.\\n\\nIf you like what you’re seeing, stay tuned for the next post where we will be elaborating more on Proof of Interaction and its use-cases.\",\"timestamp\":1641638565,\"title\":\"“How do I generate more users in Web 3?”\"},\"digest\":\"jU3Bw4ksYYUvmqlq5Lxy44cHPVj2jJapzt4vNNwM6A4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9e8b39d56f54Ca6A408fC6422AB022e85064Df10\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YmZAx_dKQwQdif71sI-L0sMfxJZTOzbrUE37JY9Qawg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L9CRk1f4_K0B7PnrNUz0mnIFjz7xhbx3r7uHWupOOW0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SBICVIPMVdGfO0SQuL2vEMewHfIfbC4UpZ3p9LvhsVEvX52nJ6EaPtdoYA_McGD8xV0eI4eiQJkS8nznEwWfXw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x776b05217333f641dfe5219471957694a19583ecc011553adad34daf75e1387509397db2e77181113836fcbbd71c5202e1d2ab32f0ae462441bfd6c06190e5511c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"YmZAx_dKQwQdif71sI-L0sMfxJZTOzbrUE37JY9Qawg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L9CRk1f4_K0B7PnrNUz0mnIFjz7xhbx3r7uHWupOOW0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jU3Bw4ksYYUvmqlq5Lxy44cHPVj2jJapzt4vNNwM6A4\"}"
