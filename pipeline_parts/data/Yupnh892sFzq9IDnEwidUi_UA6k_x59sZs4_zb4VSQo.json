"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Oh, I haven't given it up, not entirely,\\\" the girl answered.  \\\"I can always get a couple of sovereigns for a sketch, if I want it, from one or another of the frame-makers.  And they can generally sell them for a fiver.  I've seen them marked up.  Have you been long in London?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" answered Joan.  \\\"I'm a Lancashire lass.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Curious,\\\" said the girl, \\\"so am I.  My father's a mill manager near Bolton.  You weren't educated there?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" Joan admitted.  \\\"I went to Rodean at Brighton when I was ten years old, and so escaped it.  Nor were you,\\\" she added with a smile, \\\"judging from your accent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" answered the other, \\\"I was at Hastings--Miss Gwyn's.  Funny how we seem to have always been near to one another.  Dad wanted me to be a doctor.  But I'd always been mad about art.\\\"\\n\\nJoan had taken a liking to the girl.  It was a spiritual, vivacious face with frank eyes and a firm mouth; and the voice was low and strong.\\n\\n\\\"Tell me,\\\" she said, \\\"what interfered with it?\\\"  Unconsciously she was leaning forward, her chin supported by her hands.  Their faces were very near to one another.\\n\\nThe girl looked up.  She did not answer for a moment.  There came a hardening of the mouth before she spoke.\\n\\n\\\"A baby,\\\" she said.  \\\"Oh, it was my own fault,\\\" she continued.  \\\"I wanted it.  It was all the talk at the time.  You don't remember. Our right to children.  No woman complete without one.  Maternity, woman's kingdom.  All that sort of thing.  As if the storks brought them.  Don't suppose it made any real difference; but it just helped me to pretend that it was something pretty and high-class. 'Overmastering passion' used to be the explanation, before that.  I guess it's all much of a muchness:  just natural instinct.\\\"\\n\\nThe restaurant had been steadily emptying.  Monsieur Gustav and his ample-bosomed wife were seated at a distant table, eating their own dinner.\\n\\n\\\"Why couldn't you have married?\\\" asked Joan.\\n\\nThe girl shrugged her shoulders.  \\\"Who was there for me to marry?\\\" she answered.  \\\"The men who wanted me:  clerks, young tradesmen, down at home--I wasn't taking any of that lot.  And the men I might have fancied were all of them too poor.  There was one student. He's got on since.  Easy enough for him to talk about waiting. Meanwhile.  Well, it's like somebody suggesting dinner to you the day after to-morrow.  All right enough, if you're not troubled with an appetite.\\\"\\n\\nThe waiter came to clear the table.  They were almost the last customers left.  The man's tone and manner jarred upon Joan.  She had not noticed it before.  Joan ordered coffee and the girl, exchanging a joke with the waiter, added a liqueur.\\n\\n\\\"But why should you give up your art?\\\" persisted Joan.  It was that was sticking in her mind.  \\\"I should have thought that, if only for the sake of the child, you would have gone on with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I told myself all that,\\\" answered the girl.  \\\"Was going to devote my life to it.  Did for nearly two years.  Till I got sick of living like a nun:  never getting a bit of excitement.  You see, I've got the poison in me.  Or, maybe, it had always been there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's become of it?\\\" asked Joan.  \\\"The child?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mother's got it,\\\" answered the girl.  \\\"Seemed best for the poor little beggar.  I'm supposed to be dead, and my husband gone abroad.\\\"  She gave a short, dry laugh.  \\\"Mother brings him up to see me once a year.  They've got quite fond of him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What are you doing now?\\\" asked Joan, in a low tone.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, you needn't look so scared,\\\" laughed the girl, \\\"I haven't come down to that.\\\"  Her voice had changed.  It had a note of shrillness.  In some indescribable way she had grown coarse.  \\\"I'm a kept woman,\\\" she explained.  \\\"What else is any woman?\\\"\\n\\nShe reached for her jacket; and the waiter sprang forward and helped her on with it, prolonging the business needlessly.  She wished him \\\"Good evening\\\" in a tone of distant hauteur, and led the way to the door.  Outside the street was dim and silent.  Joan held out her hand.\\n\\n\\\"No hope of happy endings,\\\" she said with a forced laugh. \\\"Couldn't marry him I suppose?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has asked me,\\\" answered the girl with a swagger.  \\\"Not sure that it would suit me now.  They're not so nice to you when they've got you fixed up.  So long.\\\"\\n\\nShe turned abruptly and walked rapidly away.  Joan moved instinctively in the opposite direction, and after a few minutes found herself in a broad well-lighted thoroughfare.  A newsboy was shouting his wares.\\n\\n\\\"'Orrible murder of a woman.  Shockin' details.  Speshul,\\\" repeating it over and over again in a hoarse, expressionless monotone.\\n\\nHe was selling the papers like hot cakes; the purchasers too eager to even wait for their change.  She wondered, with a little lump in her throat, how many would have stopped to buy had he been calling instead:  \\\"Discovery of new sonnet by Shakespeare.  Extra special.\\\"\\n\\nThrough swinging doors, she caught glimpses of foul interiors, crowded with men and women released from their toil, taking their evening pleasure.  From coloured posters outside the great theatres and music halls, vulgarity and lewdness leered at her, side by side with announcements that the house was full.  From every roaring corner, scintillating lights flared forth the merits of this public benefactor's whisky, of this other celebrity's beer:  it seemed the only message the people cared to hear.  Even among the sirens of the pavement, she noticed that the quiet and merely pretty were hardly heeded.  It was everywhere the painted and the overdressed that drew the roving eyes.\\n\\nShe remembered a pet dog that someone had given her when she was a girl, and how one afternoon she had walked with the tears streaming down her face because, in spite of her scoldings and her pleadings, it would keep stopping to lick up filth from the roadway.  A kindly passer-by had laughed and told her not to mind.\\n\\n\\\"Why, that's a sign of breeding, that is, Missie,\\\" the man had explained.  \\\"It's the classy ones that are always the worst.\\\"\\n\\nIt had come to her afterwards craving with its soft brown, troubled eyes for forgiveness.  But she had never been able to break it of the habit.\\n\\nMust man for ever be chained by his appetites to the unclean:  ever be driven back, dragged down again into the dirt by his own instincts:  ever be rendered useless for all finer purposes by the baseness of his own desires?\\n\\nThe City of her Dreams!  The mingled voices of the crowd shaped itself into a mocking laugh.\\n\\nIt seemed to her that it was she that they were laughing at, pointing her out to one another, jeering at her, reviling her, threatening her.\\n\\nShe hurried onward with bent head, trying to escape them.  She felt so small, so helpless.  Almost she cried out in her despair.\\n\\nShe must have walked mechanically.  Looking up she found herself in her own street.  And as she reached her doorway the tears came suddenly.\\n\\nShe heard a quick step behind her, and turning, she saw a man with a latch key in his hand.  He passed her and opened the door; and then, facing round, stood aside for her to enter.  He was a sturdy, thick-set man with a strong, massive face.  It would have been ugly but for the deep, flashing eyes.  There was tenderness and humour in them.\\n\\n\\\"We are next floor neighbours,\\\" he said.  \\\"My name's Phillips.\\\"\\n\\nJoan thanked him.  As he held the door open for her their hands accidentally touched.  Joan wished him good-night and went up the stairs.  There was no light in her room:  only the faint reflection of the street lamp outside.\\n\\nShe could still see him:  the boyish smile.  And his voice that had sent her tears back again as if at the word of command.\\n\\nShe hoped he had not seen them.  What a little fool she was.\\n\\nA little laugh escaped her.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nOne day Joan, lunching at the club, met Madge Singleton.\\n\\n\\\"I've had such a funny letter from Flossie,\\\" said Joan, \\\"begging me almost with tears in her ink to come to her on Sunday evening to meet a 'gentleman friend' of hers, as she calls him, and give her my opinion of him.  What on earth is she up to?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's all right,\\\" answered Madge.  \\\"She doesn't really want our opinion of him--or rather she doesn't want our real opinion of him. She only wants us to confirm hers.  She's engaged to him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Flossie engaged!\\\" Joan seemed surprised.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" answered Madge.  \\\"It used to be a custom.  Young men used to ask young women to marry them.  And if they consented it was called ' being engaged.'  Still prevails, so I am told, in certain classes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thanks,\\\" said Joan.  \\\"I have heard of it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I thought perhaps you hadn't from your tone,\\\" explained Madge.\\n\\n\\\"But if she's already engaged to him, why risk criticism of him,\\\" argued Joan, ignoring Madge's flippancy.  \\\"It's too late.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, she's going to break it off unless we all assure her that we find him brainy,\\\" Madge explained with a laugh.  \\\"It seems her father wasn't brainy and her mother was.  Or else it was the other way about:  I'm not quite sure.  But whichever it was, it led to ructions.  Myself, if he's at all possible and seems to care for her, I intend to find him brilliant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And suppose she repeats her mother's experience,\\\" suggested Joan.\\n\\n\\\"There were the Norton-Browns,\\\" answered Madge.  \\\"Impossible to have found a more evenly matched pair.  They both write novels-- very good novels, too; and got jealous of one another; and threw press-notices at one another's head all breakfast-time; until they separated.  Don't know of any recipe myself for being happy ever after marriage, except not expecting it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Or keeping out of it altogether,\\\" added Joan.\\n\\n\\\"Ever spent a day at the Home for Destitute Gentlewomen at East Sheen?\\\" demanded Madge.\\n\\n\\\"Not yet,\\\" admitted Joan.  \\\"May have to, later on.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It ought to be included in every woman's education,\\\" Madge continued.  \\\"It is reserved for spinsters of over forty-five. Susan Fleming wrote an article upon it for the Teacher's Friend; and spent an afternoon and evening there.  A month later she married a grocer with five children.  The only sound suggestion for avoiding trouble that I ever came across was in a burlesque of the Blue Bird.  You remember the scene where the spirits of the children are waiting to go down to earth and be made into babies? Someone had stuck up a notice at the entrance to the gangway: 'Don't get born.  It only means worry.'\\\"\\n\\nFlossie had her dwelling-place in a second floor bed-sitting-room of a lodging house in Queen's Square, Bloomsbury; but the drawing- room floor being for the moment vacant, Flossie had persuaded her landlady to let her give her party there; it seemed as if fate approved of the idea.  The room was fairly full when Joan arrived. Flossie took her out on the landing, and closed the door behind them.\\n\\n\\\"You will be honest with me, won't you?\\\" pleaded Flossie, \\\"because it's so important, and I don't seem able to think for myself.  As they say, no man can be his own solicitor, can he?  Of course I like him, and all that--very much.  And I really believe he loves me.  We were children together when Mummy was alive; and then he had to go abroad; and has only just come back.  Of course, I've got to think of him, too, as he says.  But then, on the other hand, I don't want to make a mistake.  That would be so terrible, for both of us; and of course I am clever; and there was poor Mummy and Daddy.  I'll tell you all about them one day.  It was so awfully sad.  Get him into a corner and talk to him.  You'll be able to judge in a moment, you're so wonderful.  He's quiet on the outside, but I think there's depth in him.  We must go in now.\\\"\\n\\nShe had talked so rapidly Joan felt as if her hat were being blown away.  She had difficulty in recognizing Flossie.  All the cock- sure pertness had departed.  She seemed just a kid.\\n\\nJoan promised faithfully; and Flossie, standing on tiptoe, suddenly kissed her and then bustled her in.\\n\\nFlossie's young man was standing near the fire talking, or rather listening, to a bird-like little woman in a short white frock and blue ribbons.  A sombre lady just behind her, whom Joan from the distance took to be her nurse, turned out to be her secretary, whose duty it was to be always at hand, prepared to take down any happy idea that might occur to the bird-like little woman in the course of conversation.  The bird-like little woman was Miss Rose Tolley, a popular novelist.  She was explaining to Flossie's young man, whose name was Sam Halliday, the reason for her having written \\\"Running Waters,\\\" her latest novel.\\n\\n\\\"It is daring,\\\" she admitted.  \\\"I must be prepared for opposition. But it had to be stated.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I take myself as typical,\\\" she continued.  \\\"When I was twenty I could have loved you.  You were the type of man I did love.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Halliday, who had been supporting the weight of his body upon his right leg, transferred the burden to his left.\\n\\n\\\"But now I'm thirty-five; and I couldn't love you if I tried.\\\"  She shook her curls at him.  \\\"It isn't your fault.  It is that I have changed.  Suppose I'd married you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bit of bad luck for both of us,\\\" suggested Mr. Halliday.\\n\\n\\\"A tragedy,\\\" Miss Tolley corrected him.  \\\"There are millions of such tragedies being enacted around us at this moment.  Sensitive women compelled to suffer the embraces of men that they have come to loathe.  What's to be done?\\\"\\n\\nFlossie, who had been hovering impatient, broke in.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't you believe her,\\\" she advised Mr. Halliday.  \\\"She loves you still.  She's only teasing you.  This is Joan.\\\"\\n\\nShe introduced her.  Miss Tolley bowed; and allowed herself to be drawn away by a lank-haired young man who had likewise been waiting for an opening.  He represented the Uplift Film Association of Chicago, and was wishful to know if Miss Tolley would consent to altering the last chapter and so providing \\\"Running Waters\\\" with a happy ending.  He pointed out the hopelessness of it in its present form, for film purposes.\\n\\nThe discussion was brief.  \\\"Then I'll send your agent the contract to-morrow,\\\" Joan overheard him say a minute later.\\n\\nMr. Sam Halliday she liked at once.  He was a clean-shaven, square- jawed young man, with quiet eyes and a pleasant voice.\\n\\n\\\"Try and find me brainy,\\\" he whispered to her, as soon as Flossie was out of earshot.  \\\"Talk to me about China.  I'm quite intelligent on China.\\\"\\n\\nThey both laughed, and then shot a guilty glance in Flossie's direction.\\n\\n\\\"Do the women really crush their feet?\\\" asked Joan.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he answered.  \\\"All those who have no use for them.  About one per cent. of the population.  To listen to Miss Tolley you would think that half the women wanted a new husband every ten years.  It's always the one per cent. that get themselves talked about.  The other ninety-nine are too busy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are young for a philosopher,\\\" said Joan.\\n\\nHe laughed.  \\\"I told you I'd be all right if you started me on China,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Why are you marrying.  Flossie?\\\" Joan asked him.  She thought his point of view would be interesting.\\n\\n\\\"Not sure I am yet,\\\" he answered with a grin.  \\\"It depends upon how I get through this evening.\\\"  He glanced round the room.  \\\"Have I got to pass all this crowd, I wonder?\\\" he added.\\n\\nJoan's eyes followed.  It was certainly an odd collection. Flossie, in her hunt for brains, had issued her invitations broadcast; and her fate had been that of the Charity concert.  Not all the stars upon whom she had most depended had turned up.  On the other hand not a single freak had failed her.  At the moment, the centre of the room was occupied by a gentleman and two ladies in classical drapery.  They were holding hands in an attitude suggestive of a bas-relief.  Joan remembered them, having seen them on one or two occasions wandering in the King's Road, Chelsea; still maintaining, as far as the traffic would allow, the bas- relief suggestion; and generally surrounded by a crowd of children, ever hopeful that at the next corner they would stop and do something really interesting.  They belonged to a society whose object was to lure the London public by the force of example towards the adoption of the early Greek fashions and the simpler Greek attitudes.  A friend of Flossie's had thrown in her lot with them, but could never be induced to abandon her umbrella.  They also, as Joan told herself, were reformers.  Near to them was a picturesque gentleman with a beard down to his waist whose \\\"stunt\\\"- -as Flossie would have termed it--was hygienic clothing; it seemed to contain an undue proportion of fresh air.  There were ladies in coats and stand-up collars, and gentlemen with ringlets.  More than one of the guests would have been better, though perhaps not happier, for a bath.\\n\\n\\\"I fancy that's the idea,\\\" said Joan.  \\\"What will you do if you fail?  Go back to China?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he answered.  \\\"And take her with me.  Poor little girl.\\\"\\n\\nJoan rather resented his tone.\\n\\n\\\"We are not all alike,\\\" she remarked.  \\\"Some of us are quite sane.\\\"\\n\\nHe looked straight into her eyes.  \\\"You are,\\\" he said.  \\\"I have been reading your articles.  They are splendid.  I'm going to help.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How can you?\\\" she said.  \\\"I mean, how will you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shipping is my business,\\\" he said.  \\\"I'm going to help sailor men. See that they have somewhere decent to go to, and don't get robbed. And then there are the Lascars, poor devils.  Nobody ever takes their part.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How did you come across them?\\\" she asked.  \\\"The articles, I mean. Did Flo give them to you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" he answered.  \\\"Just chance.  Caught sight of your photo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me,\\\" she said.  \\\"If it had been the photo of a woman with a bony throat and a beaky nose would you have read them?\\\"\\n\\nHe thought a moment.  \\\"Guess not,\\\" he answered.  \\\"You're just as bad,\\\" he continued.  \\\"Isn't it the pale-faced young clergyman with the wavy hair and the beautiful voice that you all flock to hear? No getting away from nature.  But it wasn't only that.\\\"  He hesitated.\\n\\n\\\"I want to know,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"You looked so young,\\\" he answered.  \\\"I had always had the idea that it was up to the old people to put the world to rights--that all I had to do was to look after myself.  It came to me suddenly while you were talking to me--I mean while I was reading you:  that if you were worrying yourself about it, I'd got to come in, too-- that it would be mean of me not to.  It wasn't like being preached to.  It was somebody calling for help.\\\"\\n\\nInstinctively she held out her hand and he grasped it.\\n\\nFlossie came up at the same instant.  She wanted to introduce him to Miss Lavery, who had just arrived.\\n\\n\\\"Hullo!\\\" she said.  \\\"Are you two concluding a bargain?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Joan.  \\\"We are founding the League of Youth.  You've got to be in it.  We are going to establish branches all round the world.\\\"\\n\\nFlossie's young man was whisked away.  Joan, who had seated herself in a small chair, was alone for a few minutes.\\n\\nMiss Tolley had chanced upon a Human Document, with the help of which she was hopeful of starting a \\\"Press Controversy\\\" concerning the morality, or otherwise, of \\\"Running Waters.\\\"  The secretary stood just behind her, taking notes.  They had drifted quite close. Joan could not help overhearing.\\n\\n\\\"It always seemed to me immoral, the marriage ceremony,\\\" the Human Document was explaining.  She was a thin, sallow woman, with an untidy head and restless eyes that seemed to be always seeking something to look at and never finding it.  \\\"How can we pledge the future?  To bind oneself to live with a man when perhaps we have ceased to care for him; it's hideous.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Tolley murmured agreement.\\n\\n\\\"Our love was beautiful,\\\" continued the Human Document, eager, apparently, to relate her experience for the common good; \\\"just because it was a free gift.  We were not fettered to one another. At any moment either of us could have walked out of the house.  The idea never occurred to us; not for years--five, to be exact.\\\"\\n\\nThe secretary, at a sign from Miss Tolley, made a memorandum of it.\\n\\n\\\"And then did your feelings towards him change suddenly?\\\" questioned Miss Tolley.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" explained the Human Document, in the same quick, even tones; \\\"so far as I was concerned, I was not conscious of any alteration in my own attitude.  But he felt the need of more solitude--for his development.  We parted quite good friends.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said Miss Tolley.  \\\"And were there any children?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Only two,\\\" answered the Human Document, \\\"both girls.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What has become of them?\\\" persisted Miss Tolley.\\n\\nThe Human Document looked offended.  \\\"You do not think I would have permitted any power on earth to separate them from me, do you?\\\" she answered.  \\\"I said to him, 'They are mine, mine.  Where I go, they go.  Where I stay, they stay.'  He saw the justice of my argument.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And they are with you now?\\\" concluded Miss Tolley.\\n\\n\\\"You must come and see them,\\\" the Human Document insisted.  \\\"Such dear, magnetic creatures.  I superintend their entire education myself.  We have a cottage in Surrey.  It's rather a tight fit. You see, there are seven of us now.  But the three girls can easily turn in together for a night, Abner will be delighted.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Abner is your second?\\\" suggested Miss Tolley.\\n\\n\\\"My third,\\\" the Human Document corrected her.  \\\"After Eustace, I married Ivanoff.  I say 'married' because I regard it as the holiest form of marriage.  He had to return to his own country. There was a political movement on foot.  He felt it his duty to go. I want you particularly to meet the boy.  He will interest you.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Tolley appeared to be getting muddled.  \\\"Whose boy?\\\" she demanded.\\n\\n\\\"Ivanoff's,\\\" explained the Human Document.  \\\"He was our only child.\\\"\\n\\nFlossie appeared, towing a white-haired, distinguished-looking man, a Mr. Folk.  She introduced him and immediately disappeared.  Joan wished she had been left alone a little longer.  She would like to have heard more.  Especially was she curious concerning Abner, the lady's third.  Would the higher moral law compel him, likewise, to leave the poor lady saddled with another couple of children?  Or would she, on this occasion, get in--or rather, get off, first? Her own fancy was to back Abner.  She did catch just one sentence before Miss Tolley, having obtained more food for reflection than perhaps she wanted, signalled to her secretary that the note-book might be closed.\\n\\n\\\"Woman's right to follow the dictates of her own heart, uncontrolled by any law,\\\" the Human Document was insisting:  \\\"That is one of the first things we must fight for.\\\"\\n\\nMr. Folk was a well-known artist.  He lived in Paris.  \\\"You are wonderfully like your mother,\\\" he told Joan.  \\\"In appearance, I mean,\\\" he added.  \\\"I knew her when she was Miss Caxton.  I acted with her in America.\\\"\\n\\nJoan made a swift effort to hide her surprise.  She had never heard of her mother having been upon the stage.\\n\\n\\\"I did not know that you had been an actor,\\\" she answered.\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't really,\\\" explained Mr. Folk.  \\\"I just walked and talked naturally.  It made rather a sensation at the time.  Your mother was a genius.  You have never thought of going on the stage yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" said Joan.  \\\"I don't think I've got what you call the artistic temperament.  I have never felt drawn towards anything of that sort.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder,\\\" he said.  \\\"You could hardly be your mother's daughter without it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me,\\\" said Joan.  \\\"What was my mother like?  I can only remember her as more or less of an invalid.\\\"\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/48](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/48)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639209750,\"title\":\"I thought you were something,\\\" answered the girl.  \\\"I'm an artist.
