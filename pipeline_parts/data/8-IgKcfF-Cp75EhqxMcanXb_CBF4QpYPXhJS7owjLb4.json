"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"His name was Grug and he had gone two moons without taking a boar. He had tried all his usual places. He had tried the big water, to catch the boar drinking. He had tried the big tree forest, to catch the boar grazing. He had tried the big grassy hilltop, to catch the boar sleeping. Wherever he tried, he found no boar.\\n\\nGrug had taken his first boar a couple moons after he had taken his first steps. Grug’s father had apprehended a great boar, had wrangled it back to the family cave, had bestowed upon Grug the family spear. But what was more, Grug’s father had bestowed upon Grug the responsibility of ending the boar’s life. When the boar lay dead and twitching, young Grug drank the blood that sprang from the wound, and together as a family they had sustained themselves on that boar for moons to come. For Grug, boar was life and family. And to go so long without taking a boar was death and failure.\\n\\nLumbering through the big tree forest with the family spear held down by his side, his hairy feet leaving big prints in the soil, now a man in his own right; Grug wondered if his father before him had ever gone two moons without taking a boar. Grug could not remember. Times had been hard for Grug as a young boy. There had been storms. There had been wolves. There had been the big ear tribe from the next valley over. But there had always been boar. What would his father think now? Would Grug’s father be ashamed of him, for going this long without taking a boar?\\n\\nThe moon came, and Grug knew that Grug would be going three moons without taking a boar, less he stick around and face the wolves. He moved back to his family cave as dusk swept across the valley, where his beloved mate Reeba was waiting expectantly for him at the mouth of their cave. Grug could not meet her gaze.\\n\\nGrug approached the mouth of the cave, his head hung low in shame.\\n\\n“No boar?” said Reeba.\\n\\n“No boar,” said Grug.\\n\\n“Why,” said Reeba, fingering her necklace of boar tusks.\\n\\nWithout looking at Reeba, Grug shrugged and spoke.\\n\\n“Problem with boar. No problem with Grug.”\\n\\nInside the family cave Reeba did not interact with Grug. She sat silently in the corner, facing the wall, incessantly milling grains of wheat on a big flat millstone. Reeba was an excellent gatherer. The best of all the gatherers. If not for the grain and fruit she scrounged up, the pair would have been much hungrier these last few days.\\n\\n“Reeba thinks,” said Reeba. “That Reeba need new tusk on necklace.”\\n\\n“Problem with boar,” said Grug, lying on his side, unable to think about anything except boar.\\n\\n“Did Grug try big water?” said Reeba.\\n\\n“Yes. First place Grug looked.”\\n\\n“Did Grug try big tree forest?”\\n\\n“Yes. Next place Grug looked. And before Reeba talk next, Grug looked on big grass hilltop and again Grug found no boar.”\\n\\n“Maybe Grug does not know what Grug is looking for.”\\n\\n“Grug knows what Grug is looking for!”\\n\\nThey turned to face each other. Reeba smiled, but Grug knew she was not happy like when she had smiled when she looked upon him for the first time.\\n\\n“How many moons,” she said. “Since Reeba put new tusk on necklace? Answer, Grug. Answer Reeba. How many moons?”\\n\\n“Necklace not important,” said Grug. “Meat important. Problem with boar. Grug will get boar tomorrow. Reeba will see.”\\n\\n“And what if Grug is wrong?”\\n\\n“Then Reeba can go and look for boar herself!”\\n\\nReeba stood and moved over to the mouth of the cave, where she looked out on the dark valley beyond.\\n\\nWithout looking back at Grug she said, “Gian has boar.”\\n\\nGrug’s vision went blurry. The hairs on his knuckles stood on end. He stumbled to his feet.\\n\\n“Reeba. Say again.”\\n\\nShe turned to face Grug and said, “Reeba was with Oobie today gathering grain in valley when Reeba notice big new tusk on Oobie’s necklace. Oobie had big smile and mean eyes when Oobie asked Reeba if Reeba had any new tusk on Reeba’s necklace. And Reeba didn’t want to tell Oobie that Grug had not—”\\n\\nGrug ran up on Reeba and tackled her to the ground and straddled her and held one hairy hand in the air as if to strike down upon Reeba. They both knew that Grug could not and would not strike Reeba in this fashion, for Grug loved Reeba, and Reeba knew this all too well. Reeba smiled again, that menacing gesture.\\n\\n“Grug get boar for Reeba!” said Grug. “Grug go out every moon for Reeba! Does Reeba think Grug not want to find boar.”\\n\\n“Reeba thinks Grug can *not* find boar.”\\n\\nHer words penetrated him like the thrust of a spear. Grug found his feet and walked to the mouth of the cave. He looked out onto the dark valley and spoke calmly, for Grug knew that only calm can weather a storm.\\n\\n“Did Oobie say where Gian found boar?”\\n\\n“Reeba has bigger questions for Oobie,” said Reeba. “Reeba want to know why Oobie has two children and Reeba has none.”\\n\\nGrug seethed. Not this old thing. Not again. It wasn’t up to Grug to put little Grug inside Reeba. That was the moon’s doing, and Grug knew better than to meddle in such affairs.\\n\\n“Lay with me tonight,” Grug demand.\\n\\nReeba strolled back and sat before her millstone.\\n\\nReeba did not lay with Grug that night. She lay in the corner, away from Grug, flat on her face, snoring the moon away, while Grug sat up against the wall, scheming.\\n\\nGian wasn’t anything special. He was not as big as Grug. He was not as fast as Grug. He was not as strong as Grug. So why did the moon bestow upon Gian the gift of boar while withholding such things from Grug. Grug would find out. Grug would find out right now.\\n\\nGrug took the family spear, not to intimidate Gian, but in case Grug stumbled across a wolf out in the night. The trek to Gian’s cave was well-travelled. As a boy, young Grug and young Gian had been great friends. Gian had funny ideas. Funny ideas about the moon, and how it moved through the sky not by it’s own will, but by some predetermined schedule. Such were the funny ideas of Gian.\\n\\nGrug approached the mouth of Gian’s family cave, which was much larger than Grug’s family cave, and Grug banged his spear on the ground. Next thing Grug knew, the business end of Gian’s family spear was under Grug’s neck, pressing gently into Grug’s tender throat.\\n\\n“It’s Grug,” said Gian. “What does Grug want with Gian now.”\\n\\n“Did Gian find boar today?”\\n\\nA triumphant smile grew across Gian’s small face.\\n\\n“Gian found three boar.”\\n\\nGrug couldn’t believe it. He pawed sweat from his brow.\\n\\n“Did Gian say three boar?”\\n\\n“Three boar,” said Gian.\\n\\n“Grug looked near the big water to catch the boar drinking. Grug looked in the big tree forest to catch the boar grazing. Grug looked on the grassy hilltop to catch the boar sleeping. But Grug found nothing. Where did Gian hunt for these boar?”\\n\\n“No,” said Gian. “Grug doesn’t understand. Gian did not hunt for these boar. Gian was given these boar.”\\n\\n“Given?” said Grug. “By…the moon?”\\n\\n“No, silly Grug,” Gian said. “Gian was given three boar by the big ear village from the next valley over.”\\n\\n“They gave Gian the boar? And what did Gian give the big ear village?”\\n\\n“Gian gave his word.”\\n\\nGrug was confused. He thought Gian said “word”, but he couldn’t be sure.\\n\\n“What did Gian give big ear village?”\\n\\n“Gian gave his word,” said Gian. “Big ear village want four boar in ten moons in exchange for three boar now. These boar had big tusk, Grug. Big tusk for Oobie’s necklace. And Oobie is happy. Oobie lay with Gian twice this moon.”\\n\\nGrug strolled away. Sleep would not come for him that moon. He watched it go away. He watched the sun take the place where the moon had once been. Grug would see what big ear village had to say about this.\\n\\nGrug didn’t bother to tell Reeba of his plans. Reeba wouldn’t understand. And Grug knew in his own way that Reeba never would understand. Grug knew that Reeba would stay around if and only if Grug gave her big boar tusks to add to her necklace.\\n\\nGrug got about halfway to the next village over, the family spear down by his side, when he heard an unfamiliar voice call out to him.\\n\\n“Wanderer. Come here, wanderer.”\\n\\nGrug oriented himself on the unfamiliar noise and found a little man of many moons walking along. Grug’s jaw almost hit the brush beneath his feet, because Grug saw that this little man of many moons had three boar following him one after the other in a neat little line.\\n\\nGrug approached the man with his spear outstretched. Grug noticed that this little man of many moons had great big ears on either side of his head .Grug didn’t say anything, just pointed his family spear at the little man with the big ears. The little man disarmed Grug with a smile.\\n\\n“I’m the tradesmen,” he said. “Many moons have I been the tradesmen. And many moon have I sold the finest boar you ever did see. Take a look at these boar. Healthy, right?”\\n\\n“Grug want boar,” Grug said.\\n\\n“These three boar are yours,” said the tradesman. “Grug is the name, is it? You want these boar, Grug?”\\n\\n“Why little man with big ear give Grug boar? Why not eat boar yourself.”\\n\\n“The tradesman wants you to have it, Grug.”\\n\\n“What does the tradesmen want from Grug in return.”\\n\\nThe tradesman smiled.\\n\\n“I want your word.”\\n\\nGrug yelled something at the guy and said, “Does that word count?”\\n\\nThe tradesman, who had clearly seen many moons, smiled along good-naturedly and said, “No, that’s not how this is going to work, Grug. The way it works is that I’ll give you these three boars. And you give me your word that, in ten moons, you will give me four.”\\n\\nGrug inspected the boar. They looked fine indeed. He turned his family spear around and prodded at the boar with the blunt end. These were boar, alright. And they had great tusks.\\n\\n“Grug has different idea,” said Grug.\\n\\nGrug swung his family spear and cracked the tradesman across the chops with a vicious blow. The tradesman went down with a pathetic yelp. Grug wasted no time. He speared the three boars, skewered them on his spear, and carried them home to Reeba.\\n\\nReeba didn’t arrive back at the family cave until the moon came out, which Grug found strange, but which also afforded Grug the opportunity to catch up on his rest. When she came home she couldn’t believe her eyes. Three boar.\\n\\n“Grug,” she said, lovingly. “Oh Grug. Look what you have brought Reeba. Where did Grug find these boar?”\\n\\n“These boar?” Grug said smoothly. “Why, Grug found one drinking from the big water. Grug found one grazing in the big tree forest. And Grug found one sleeping on the big grassy hilltop. Grug knows what Grug is looking for.”\\n\\nReeba looked from the three boars and back to Grug.\\n\\n“But Gian said,” Reeba began, but stopped talking.\\n\\nShe looked away.\\n\\n“Gian?” said Grug. “Why did Reeba talk to Gian. Did…Reeba go talk with Oobie?”\\n\\n“Yes,” said Reeba, quickly. “Yes. Reeba went to Gian to see Oobie. That’s all.”\\n\\nGrug smiled.\\n\\n“Now Reeba will have enough tusk for two necklace.”\\n\\nReeba lay with Grug twice that moon before falling asleep beside him, flat out like a lizard drinking. Nine moons passed and all was well with Reeba and Grug. Grug had not gone out searching for more boar. Reeba did not go out and graze with the other women. Three boar could last many moons, possibly ten if rationed properly.\\n\\nOn the first moon they ate until they couldn’t eat anymore. Reeba spent her free time fashioning hunks of tusk to her necklace they way all women did. She took great pride in that necklace, often asking Grug if it made her look like a woman of less moons.\\n\\nWith the next moon came more of the same. But as the moons came and went, and the boar meat dwindled away, so did Reeba’s happiness. Until finally, after nine moons and all the meat was gone, both Reeba’s happiness and the boar meat were just a memory.\\n\\nReeba did not lay with Grug on that tenth moon. She had since resumed her gathering, and she spent most her time in her usual spot near the millstone. The necklace didn’t seem to give her the joy it once had. Grug would go out looking for boar when the tenth moon fell. And he was sure that he would find some.\\n\\nGrug did not find any boar drinking from the big water. Grug did not find any boar grazing in the big tree forest. But Grug did find a boar sleeping on the big grass hilltop. Grug approached the boar silently, his spear outstretched.\\n\\nThis wasn’t your average boar. It was small. Possibly the size of one of Grug’s feet. It was slimy and it was not asleep, rather, it was dead. Grug picked up the boar and took it home to Reeba. Reeba was not at the family cave when Grug returned. She came home when the moon came out, a bundle of wheat under her arm.\\n\\n“Where has Reeba been?” Grug demanded.\\n\\n“Does Grug have boar?” asked Reeba, hopefully, tenderly.\\n\\n“Grug has boar. But answer Grug’s question.”\\n\\n“Reeba was with Oobie. Reeba show Oobie new tusk necklace.”\\n\\nReeba approached Grug. Grug stretched out his arms in a vain attempt to cuddle his mate. But Reeba looked at the feeble boar that Grug had cut up.\\n\\n“That’s all?” said Reeba. “That isn’t enough.”\\n\\nGrug felt both shame and anger.\\n\\n“It will do. Grug provide for Reeba.”\\n\\nReeba didn’t seem interested in the boar. She dropped her bundle of wheat next to the millstone and got to work.\\n\\n“Oobie said funny thing today,” said Reeba, milling.\\n\\n“Oobie and Gian are funny,” said Grug. “Do not listen when they talk.”\\n\\n“Gian gets three boar every ten moons,” said Reeba. “Why don’t Grug get three boar again like Grug did last time.”\\n\\n“There is a problem with boar,” said Grug. “Gian is not hunting for the boar. Gian is getting the boar some other way.”\\n\\n“Gian has boar,” said Reeba. “Enough boar for two mates.”\\n\\nSleep eluded Grug. He thought about the little man of many moons with the big ears, tradesman. He wondered why that man hadn’t killed the boars and eaten them himself. But most of all, Grug wondered about his father.\\n\\nGrug wondered if his mother had been like Reeba. Maybe she had. Grug loved his mother—may the moon guide her—but surely if she had acted the way Reeba was acting, then maybe he would not have loved her so. But then again, Grug had to consider, maybe when there is always boar, there are no problems. Grug didn’t know.\\n\\nGrug just wanted everyone to be happy. And everyone cant be happy if Grug isn’t happy.\\n\\nReeba said that something is wrong with Grug. But maybe it isn’t Grug. Maybe it is boar that is the problem. When in all of Grug’s life had he seen a little slimy boar like that? He had. A great big boar. Not big and muscular. But fat in the belly, the way Oobie was fat in the belly for all those moons. He had been a young boy. Hunting with his father.\\n\\nAfter father killed the big fat boar, something had slid out of it. Grug’s father had bent down and taken it and sniffed it and had told Grug to take it home, whereupon Grug ate it. Which he had done with the boar he found this present moon.\\n\\nGrug knew one thing for certain. While Grug had seen slimy little boars, Grug had never seen people offering boar in exchange for more future boar. Maybe Gian new more than he was letting on.\\n\\nThunder cracked, and rain followed, and Grug went to Gian’s cave, which, he realized, was much smoother than his own family cave. Grug slapped the butt of his family spear into the slippery stone beneath him to summon his great friend.\\n\\nBy the time Grug realised that Gian was behind him, it was too late. The business end of Gian’s family spear was pressed into the back of Grug’s tender throat.\\n\\n“It’s Grug,” said Gian. “What does Grug want with Gian now. Did Reeba…”\\n\\nGrug said, “Remember how Gian told Grug about getting those three boars.”\\n\\n“Gian remembers,” said Gian, lowering his spear.\\n\\n“Where did Gian get those boars?”\\n\\nGian came and faced his great friend. Gian smiled.\\n\\n“Come inside, Grug. Out of this rain.”\\n\\nGrug didn’t like going in to Gian’s cave, the way he didn’t like Gian coming into his cave, where Gian could freely cast his eyes and judgements on it all. But Grug entered. It was warm and cosy here. Oobie was faced down in the background. There seemed to be no more Oobie, for it was all tusk. Around her neck. Through her ears. In her nose. Out her mouth.\\n\\nGian said, “A little old man of many moons with big ears. The tradesman. He offered me three boars for the price of four boars in ten moons.”\\n\\n“And did Gian agree?”\\n\\n“Gian agreed.”\\n\\n“And what happened when ten moons passed. Did you offer four boars?”\\n\\nGian smiled.\\n\\n“No. Gian borrow more boar.”\\n\\n“What?” said Grug.\\n\\n“The tradesman wanted his payment. Four boars. Instead, Gian borrowed six boars, gave him four, kept two, and promised to pay eight in ten moons.”\\n\\n“And what happened when the next ten moons passed?”\\n\\n“Gian borrowed more boar. Like before. Grug has to understand that every time Gian borrows boars from the tradesman, the tradesman gets that forth boar. That’s how it all adds up. Tradesman gets it for his labour. And so the more Gian borrows, the more the tradesman makes, and the more he lends.”\\n\\n“When does it end?” said Grug. “When has Gian borrowed too many boar?”\\n\\nGian shrugged.\\n\\n“Think about the wolves, Grug,” said Gian.\\n\\n“What about the wolves?” said Grug.\\n\\n“Without so many boar around,” said Gian. “There wont be so many wolves around. And without so many wolves around, there will be less wolf attacks. Grug wont have to walk around with his family spear all the time.”\\n\\nGrug gripped his spear reflexively. Grug didn’t understand. Grug enjoyed carrying hs spear around, and Gian recognised this.\\n\\n“Grug, my great friend,” Gian said, patting Grug on his broad shoulder. “Let me ask you this. Doesn’t Grug think there is a better way? Does Grug want to spend the rest of his moons out near the big water or in the big tree forest, or on the grassy hilltop. All for boars? Isn’t there more to life, Grug.”\\n\\n“Maybe,” said Grug. “Maybe when Grug has enough boar, and when Reeba has sufficient tusk, Grug will be able to answer these questions. But Grug doesn’t have enough boar. And Grug, the great hunter of boar—ask anyone—can’t find any boar. That is a problem.”\\n\\n“Borrow,” said Gian.\\n\\n“No,” said Grug. “Grug doesn’t trust it. Grug doesn’t want to owe anything. Grug thinks boar should be found, not borrowed.”\\n\\nGian shrugged again.\\n\\nGrug said, “Great friend Gian, Grug plans to investigate this matter further. The big ear village is the source of this. Grug moves at once. Will Grug have your spear?”\\n\\nGian nodded. Gian held out his spear, offering it to Grug.\\n\\n“Here you go, Grug. Gian can not offer his life. But Gian can offer his family spear.”\\n\\nGrug nodded, took Gian’s family spear, pointed himself roughly in the direction of the big ear village, and took off into the rain.\\n\\nGrug crashed through the landscape, screaming, both spears held high above high above his head. The wolves were in hot pursuit. But they were wolves. And he was Grug, the great hunter of boar.\\n\\nGrug leapt from treetop to treetop. Grug swung from vine to vine. Grug swam, and he climbed, and he crawled, and there wasn’t a force in that land that could take him. Until he met a giant impenetrable thing.\\n\\nIt was like a tree. But lots of them. And no leaves. Just the trunks. Next to each other, but stripped, and grown in a ring pattern. And it was noisy. The noise of a hundred thousand boars, screaming, squealing. Grug looked through a gap between trees. He saw more or less what he had heard.\\n\\nGrug thrust his family spear between the upright trees and pried with all his strength. No luck. The trees were immovable. And Grug knew why. Grug’s father had explained it simply. For all the tree you see above ground, there is much more root underground. The only thing that could slay trees, Grug knew, is a storm.\\n\\nGrug was strong, a great hunter of boar, but he had nothing on a storm and he knew it. He knew he was not getting through these trees. He moved. He traced the perimeter of trees. And Grug found a funny thing.\\n\\nGrug found a figure, a white figure, as white as the moon, with white clothes, and white skin, and white hair, and a white face, holding a clear sack filled to the brim with small slimy boars. This white creature was easily three times the size of Grug. And it breathed fire.\\n\\nThe creature hurled a slimy boar at Grug, and Grug dove away. Grug took off, a spear in each hand, and the creature followed, hurling boars at Grug.\\n\\nGrug dodged and ducked and evaded everything the creature had. Grug approached a section of forest he knew well, and veered off towards a boulder he also knew well. The creature followed.\\n\\nIt was big and it was white and it was hurling little boars at Grug, but the creature was absolutely silent. Not a noise reached Grug’s ears.\\n\\nGrug found the boulder. He dove and did a flip over the boulder and took refuge in its shelter. Grug pointed one spear out to the left, and one spear out to the right, and listened. He heard nothing. He looked left. He looked right. He looked up.\\n\\nNothing.\\n\\nHe looked left. He looked right. Grug looked up, and saw nothing.\\n\\nThe creature came over the top of the boulder, slowly, curiously, and Grug took its head off with a spear scissor slice. Hot gas spewed from the falling head, and Grug got out of there, and traced his way back to the boar.\\n\\nMany of the perimeter trees had fell. And the boar roamed freely now. Grug smiled. Grug speared two boars, and made his way back to his family cave.\\n\\nGrug returned to his family cave and found both Reeba and Gian. This suited Grug perfectly, for he had reason to speak with both of them.\\n\\n“Gian,” Grug said, offering back the family spear. “Gian’s spear was useful. And it will remain useful. The boar have returned. They are at the big water, drinking. They are at—”\\n\\n“Grug,” Gian said, cutting Grug off in Grug’s family cave. “I prefer to borrow my boar.”\\n\\n“All is well,” said Grug. “And I will hunt for mine. Now go, Gian. Tend to Oobie. Grug needs time with his woman.”\\n\\n“But Grug,” said Gian, “Reeba and I…”\\n\\nBut he stopped talking, and Reeba was shaking her head furiously at him. Gian left.\\n\\n“Reeba,” said Grug. “Grug have these boar for Reeba.”\\n\\n“Thankyou, Grug,” Reeba said, coming close to him.\\n\\nShe said nothing for a while.\\n\\nThen she said, “The moon blessed Reeba with a child. A little Grug.”\\n\\nGrug smiled. And he was happy. And Reeba was happy. For a while. And life went on for Grug. And after much life, and much change, Grug came to realize the great potential in what he saw with the trees and the boar. When next Grug took to the wilderness in search of boar, he did so thinking not only of himself, but also of the boar.\\n\\nWhen he found boar drinking by the big water, and when he found boar grazing in the big tree forest, and when he found boar dozing on the grassy hilltop, he did not pounce. He watched. He studied. He looked for families amongst them. He looked for the little ones. And in the night, when the peaceful boars were sleeping, Grug would take their little ones and slit their throats and drink their blood. As he had done Gian’s. As he had done Reeba’s. As he had done with that child—the child with the big ears.\\n\\nThe end.\",\"timestamp\":1642562831,\"title\":\"Grug Learns About Commerce\"},\"digest\":\"fkdS_qXxPDOokO1noj1KtZzn30FSmj6Sr9g_BwjE_ng\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf1857Bb1E111e761fcA7224Fc29eFbd25EC93C13\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hFZ3jMBdfJfQFxA5AdOj5oLRtbQ1vynE82fXaFKmjvE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2snBGatc1IkL-iAKo22q8I298-FHYfuKhZlk70rm6ak\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Y9FUvdwITdCOEYWciURJh-QBxosJ4wmi66e0ZrehnJuOkMCVR5FrJ7DWGbhkUeDuwJkuocExe3mN2DtHIj_N0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3311d2dcb08dee22bfc5b9f51aa5aab8225a63fe0b2a508b06602998b2f1483732d0ff8b157e7d200339cfeaaebcabffbeade5f1ff4440e18d722c3da9efad371b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"hFZ3jMBdfJfQFxA5AdOj5oLRtbQ1vynE82fXaFKmjvE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2snBGatc1IkL-iAKo22q8I298-FHYfuKhZlk70rm6ak\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"saqVPFbrjXztcqPMUotHZZ3lj_p_4lDFGpf5BB6QTRw\"}"
