An answer from Horace was both more full, and of more\\ndignity, than any I could have made in my own person; and the example of\\nmuch greater freedom in so eminent a divine as Dr. Donne, seemed a proof\\nwith what indignation and contempt a Christian may treat vice or folly, in\\never so low, or ever so high a station.  Both these authors were acceptable\\nto the princes and ministers under whom they lived.  The Satires of Dr.\\nDonne I versified, at the desire of the Earl of Oxford while he was Lord\\nTreasurer, and of the Duke of Shrewsbury who had been Secretary of State,\\nneither of whom looked upon a satire on vicious courts as any reflection on\\nthose they served in.  And indeed there is not in the world a greater\\nerror, than that which fools are so apt to fall into, and knaves with good\\nreason to encourage, the mistaking a satirist for a libeller; whereas to a\\ntrue satirist nothing is so odious as a libeller, for the same reason as to\\na man truly virtuous nothing is so hateful as a hypocrite.\\n\\n```\\n UNI AEQUUS VIRTUTI ATQUE EJUS AMICIS.
