"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**CT Markets Pro User: How many full nodes are in operation? Is there a limit to the amount of decentralization that can be achieved?**\\n\\n**MC:** Short answer, there were a few hundred last we checked. For the rest, great question, and buckle up for a longer answer. It’s important to note that unlike PoW based networks, like Bitcoin, the number of STX miners alone is not an accurate reflection of a miner’s relative ability to win blocks over time. As a result, it does not reflect the security or decentralization of the network. To successfully attack Stacks 2.0, a miner would need to mine a genuinely longer chain than the rest of the network. Unlike a PoW based chain, the Stacks chain quality is measured by its length and not the total amount of BTC burned (or resources expended). This means that simply spending 100x the BTC of every other miner will not result in a longer or better Stacks chain tip. Instead, a miner would have to consistently out-mine every other participant to attack the Stacks chain successfully. To do this, a “bad actor” miner needs to effectively guarantee they could win every block over the period their attack occurs.\",\"timestamp\":1639128063,\"title\":\"State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Minister of Commerce\"},\"digest\":\"2kkrZuzyxYpascN12W58wupVhz2AQKxStkJWr1v51j8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0A94d72AA41F62192047eb57550980F5C5b41ADc\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SGmAYRsr2Cu7M4NoamvZu6Vt6q1bsNv8a5rJ-IvYzYU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Snf070Xq_H_O3_mI9YoM73HOojGivhG14yyL3CsFkx4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"36xkoy2XStLv5_yuHlI-iucPFl8QY7zfk48l2vjmxXHakbmIzqlKJmq_CYSlthsoh7zPdQcJIPZA57SgrwZP-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb0b8352deb4f0a64d31f5a343120381e0c153ef995312ed2275beb5e608f569d39c1767636a6dbc0c72c8582bbb1707d4d90eac5c190841ba581f9298f6e82331c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SGmAYRsr2Cu7M4NoamvZu6Vt6q1bsNv8a5rJ-IvYzYU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Snf070Xq_H_O3_mI9YoM73HOojGivhG14yyL3CsFkx4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2kkrZuzyxYpascN12W58wupVhz2AQKxStkJWr1v51j8\"}"
