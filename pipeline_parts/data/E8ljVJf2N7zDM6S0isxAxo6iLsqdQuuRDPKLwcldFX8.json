We believe web 3 and social tokens invert this old dynamic and return ownership to creators and their communities.\\n\\nTokens give communities super powers. Today, groups of people using accessible, on-chain tools can leverage tokens to capitalize, reward, govern and grow collective value on the internet.\\n\\nAnd while it’s never been easier to issue a community token, the path to developing one with lasting utility and influence requires a holistic approach spanning governance, tokenomics, incentives and community organization.\\n\\nSeed Club brings community leaders, brands, investors and builders together to solve these complex problems and bring the best community tokens to market.\\n\\nWe believe there will be tokenized communities worth $Billions, and we plan to help launch them.\\n\\n**How We Work**\\n\\nThrough our Accelerator program and Studio offering, we help community token projects design their token economy, establish governance processes and grow their social and economic value. We earn a percentage of their token supply for long term alignment with our incubated communities.\\n\\nAs these communities/DAOs tokenize and scale, the value of the tokens in Seed Club's treasury will appreciate in parallel. By aligning incentives with these tokenized communities, Seed Club will actively participate in the growth of the overall token ecosystem.\\n\\nIt’s our hope that our growing community will take an active role in curating and supporting the growth of these tokenized communities, earning a stake in Seed Club in return.\\n\\n### You Should Join Us.\\n\\nStay at the cutting edge of web3 trends, help steward Seed Club’s growing social token treasury and explore new ways for digital communities to create and deliver value.\\n\\nStay up to date: [Subscribe to the Seed Club Newsletter](https://seedclub.substack.com/welcome)\\n\\nDiscord: [discord.gg/WT2fHy4](http://www.discord.gg/WT2fHy4)\\nTwitter: [@seedclubhq](http://www.twitter.com/seedclubhq)\\nWebsite: [seedclub.xyz](notion://www.notion.so/www.seedclub.xyz)\\n\\nListen to Jess Sloss on [The Delphi Podcast](https://twitter.com/Shaughnessy119/status/1400827073564979213?s=20) and [The Defiant](https://t.co/96jPb0GEVP?amp=1)\",\"timestamp\":1626361846,\"title\":\"Seed Club Raises $2m to build “YCombinator of Tokenized Communities”\",\"publication\":\"club\"},\"digest\":\"os-41QyxcPN0Ikzf-UZy2zY5W4xep8bpBBKRtQbjBME\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x42DFAf5266Ad40AB4533F9806F5CC1DF4C1eB363\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FvVfLlVt2UrNodE-ZtyOmDPwfEQfFPEdNAN29bskElY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XD-20zRIrb7t1FTeKTFQBmVVbgJqyzolRWONpXC8cV4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"A_x7wTrJrMjCxaIh7XfkYqXuR5y5mLolvzVyPVvo1C_9d25Y76DLtXvPXqzC2UkGI_aiOKVOjEpnL9bI2xqKIg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x78907866bdad9d620a19f865aef9229993a96bb81312acec2d6e3dfd116367bb2e9b9ff40063e29e0414b12c6d211c3b6c46d82706cc841fe1b2b4d5438e54d71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on club.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FvVfLlVt2UrNodE-ZtyOmDPwfEQfFPEdNAN29bskElY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"XD-20zRIrb7t1FTeKTFQBmVVbgJqyzolRWONpXC8cV4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"a5PQAwU0CuHJ90lEOmzq545nlC4qqNoTVTeHEGRrqow\"}"
