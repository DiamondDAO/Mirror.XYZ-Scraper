"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you’re receiving this, John Alleva or I have asked you to join our little community of friends, colleagues, family who are interested in learning more about Web3, how it will change the way we transact, work, invest, communicate and so much more. Personally, I feel like I have been slow on the uptake on what the impact of the blockchain can be. Recently, I have been doing more research and am becoming convinced that everything is going to change as a result of blockchain. We are already starting to see the first hype wave of it with cryptocurrencies, NFTs, virtual real estate. There is surely plenty of nonsense, but there is also the prospect of fundamental changes and getting educated about how to navigate, or even drive, such changes is the goal of this initiative.\\n\\nIn the newsletter, we intend to share articles, interesting companies, investment ideas, etc. You can always find previous editions of the [newsletter here](https://medium.com/@web3newsletter).\\n\\nThe value of this will be greatly increased if we are all sharing, so our request is to PLEASE SHARE WITH US. Send anything that you think this group will find interesting to web3newsletter@gmail.com. We will compile them and give you credit for the share (or post them anonymously if you chose). Feel free to forward the newsletter to people who you think can contribute to this community.\\n\\n**Feedback — We’d love to hear what you think, especially since we have never put together a newsletter. Constructive criticism is welcome.**\\n\\nThanks,  \\n Aaron\\n\\n**Cryptocurrency** \\n [Half a Billion in Bitcoin, Lost in the Dump](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/12/13/half-a-billion-in-bitcoin-lost-in-the-dump) \\n [A Bitcoin Boom Fueled by Cheap Power, Empty Plants and Few Rules](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/05/nyregion/bitcoin-mining-upstate-new-york.html) \\n [Beyond the Bitcoin Bubble](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/16/magazine/beyond-the-bitcoin-bubble.html) — From January 2018, so interesting to look back almost four years\\n\\n**NFTs** \\n [The Beginner’s Guide to NFTs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18CxGcFXnI4ouQJKBpKFHqz2NQ6AXXgfk0fBis5MwDxs/mobilepresent?slide=id.g104ee23bdc7_0_0) \\n [NFT Art Collectors Are Playing a Risky Game — And Winning](https://time.com/6126878/nft-art-collectors/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=sfmc&utm_campaign=newsletter+metaverse+default+ac&utm_content=+++20211209+++body&et_rid=185337582&lctg=185337582) \\n [From trading cards to digital video: Sports NFTs kick sports memorabilia into the digital age](https://www2.deloitte.com/global/en/insights/industry/technology/technology-media-and-telecom-predictions/2022/sports-nfts-digital-media.html/#endnote-11) \\n [NFTs and a Thousand True Fans](https://future.a16z.com/nfts-thousand-true-fans/) \\n [Why innovative brands are looking to NFTs to engage with customers](https://www.fastcompany.com/90687078/why-innovative-brands-are-looking-to-nfts-to-engage-with-customers) \\n [HOW NFTS ARE USED BY MARKETERS — A CONTINUALLY UPDATED LIST](https://adage.com/article/digital-marketing-ad-tech-news/how-brands-are-using-nfts-continually-updated-list/2376086) \\n [NFT+Entertainment — An exploration of how the content business is looking to cash in on the latest crypto craze](https://read-vip.variety.com/html5/reader/production/default.aspx?pubname=&edid=429b0a22-e012-4c1b-b8bc-9172b871329f) \\n [NFT 101: Everything You Need to Know](https://nftnow.com/guides/what-is-nft-meaning/) \\n [Snoop drops ‘Decentralized Dogg’ NFT like it’s hot](https://cointelegraph.com/news/snoop-drops-decentralized-dogg-nft-like-it-s-hot) \\n [Ubisoft adds in-game NFTs](https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-login-eafa82bb-f517-4828-b70f-9b9dbd2c1c3e.html?chunk=3&utm_term=emshare#story3)\\n\\n**Blockchain** \\n [The Future Of Real Estate Transactions On The Blockchain](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbizcouncil/2021/10/27/the-future-of-real-estate-transactions-on-the-blockchain/?sh=533d335c4938) \\n [Blockchain in advertising — Is it the answer to digital advertising’s trust and transparency gap?](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/tmt/library/blockchain-in-advertising.html)\\n\\n**DAO** \\n [In Praise of Ponzis](https://www.drorpoleg.com/in-praise-of-ponzis/) \\n [‘Buy the Constitution’ Aftermath: Everyone Very Mad, Confused, Losing Lots of Money, Fighting, Crying, Etc.](https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjb8av/constitutiondao-aftermath-everyone-very-mad-confused-losing-lots-of-money-fighting-crying-etc)\\n\\n**Virtual Real Estate** \\n [Metaverse Real Estate Piles Up Record Sales in Sandbox and Other Virtual Realms](https://www.wsj.com/articles/metaverse-real-estate-piles-up-record-sales-in-sandbox-and-other-virtual-realms-11638268380)\\n\\n**Companies** \\n A colleague of mine from Meta just started a company called [Mysten Labs ](https://mystenlabs.com/)with some other folks from Meta.
