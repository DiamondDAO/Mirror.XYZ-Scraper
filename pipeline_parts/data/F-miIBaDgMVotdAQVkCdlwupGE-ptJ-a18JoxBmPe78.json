"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Market value management is originally a strategic management behavior of Listed Companies in the stock market to comprehensively use a variety of scientific and compliant means to realize value management, maximize the company's value creation and optimize the value realization. In reality, market value management actually serves a very small number of major shareholders and a large number of retail investors, not long-term investors, but more service providers of market value management. In the coin circle, a large number of coin holders and Buddhas hold coins, and the flexibility space for market value management is very small. Therefore, since the bear market, market value management has become an empty talk, which can not achieve the large-scale concentration of chips, nor can it achieve the rapid distribution of a large number of chips in a short time.\\nChain circle and coin circle have always emphasized that the total amount is constant. With the promotion of marketization, the number of coin users increases, and the coin price is directly proportional to the square of the number of coin users, so the coin price will rise violently, so there is room for huge profits in Buddhist coin holding. However, in practice, this rationality has been wiped out by the decline of more than 95%, and market value management has become a well-known joke. Here, I'm right about things and not about people. I'm not saying that the market value management directors of major project parties have no talent, but that market value management needs to be realistic, emancipate the mind and revolutionize the currency holding psychology of the currency circle. Today's topic sharing: the way revolution of market value management.\\n1、 Psychological philosophy of successful market value management of listed companies\\nIn the stock market, stock price is the comprehensive performance of listed companies' existing operating capacity and operating prospects in the next ten years. Therefore, even if the existing operating capacity of listed companies is unattractive, listed companies can realize compliant market value management by hyping the future prospects. Regulators' supervision of the stock market is very moderate, especially the gem, because there are local financial investment in gold, even if the share price bubble is huge, regulators can not stretch their hands too long.\\nBecause the hands of regulators are not long enough, the cost of speculation by listed companies about future prospects is very small. In the absence of systemic risk, when the stock price reaches a certain level, retail investors have the impulse to copy the bottom uninvited. At the same time, institutional investors are happy to see its success. On the one hand, there is the support of low cost and sufficient power for listed companies to hype the future prospects; On the one hand, with the support of retail investors' impulse to copy the bottom, institutional investors, both public and private, are willing to join the team of win-win and mutual benefit to help listed companies hype the future prospects.\\nPreviously, we talked about a super technology board market, which specializes in listed blockchain technology projects. Soon after, the scientific innovation board entered the implementation stage. The stock market has problems, but the stock market has power. In many key areas, it is necessary to introduce the capital market power of the science and innovation board in order to form a national competitive advantage. Blockchain applies technology to complete the first step of listing on the science and innovation board. I expect that the cooperation between blockchain application technology company and blockchain project community is the combination of technology and users, and will become an important factor in the currency circle.\\nInstitutional investors such as Danhua capital, coin capital and major digital currency exchanges should focus on supporting blockchain application technology companies to complete listing on the science and innovation board in the medium term. Blockchain projects with real gold and silver strength should also try to divest assets and use a series of means to achieve listing on the science and innovation board, which in turn enhances their voice in the chain circle and currency circle. The listing of the sci-tech innovation board should become a hype topic in the currency circle, and may even become the third outlet of blockchain application, so as to realize scientific and compliant market value management.\\n2、 Two ways of market value management successor\\nWhen it comes to freedom of speech, the essence is that the market needs a mixture of good and bad, so as to improve the risk awareness of currency people, stimulate the liquidity of currency circle, stimulate the concentration and distribution of chips in a short time, and make a cake of large, medium and short-term speculation. The fish in troubled water is fish in troubled water. It is not strange to fish in troubled waters at this time. Sorry for being greedy for money. When the coin circle comes to a bear market, everyone loses, cutting leeks, cutting the project side, cutting the project side, cutting the coin king, no one can be spared.\\nTo change this situation, we should give the secondary force of market value management two opposite financing methods. One is Lido, a stable financing currency, which may serve the listing of blockchain scientific and technological assets, may be used for blockchain technology research and development, may be used to buy the technology of blockchain listed companies, and may directly raise the currency price. One is bad, financing the local token and smashing the currency price. On the one hand, it attracts strategic partners to enter the market, and on the other hand, it turns into a medium-term benefit in exchange for a stable currency.\\nEither way, it may have a short-term impact on the currency price. Therefore, all transaction obligations provide users with a compliant information disclosure system, and do some necessary audit work to protect the interests of users.\\nThe effectiveness of fiscal policy and monetary policy in macroeconomic regulation and control lies in the two-way space between the two policies. The implementation of chain circle and currency circle supervision also requires the establishment of a set of regulation and control system. Decentralization is to serve the operational efficiency of the real economy, rather than get rid of the country's economic management. Without rules, freedom is not to do what you want, but not what you don't want.\\nIn the currency circle, we do not want to see a wealth bubble. We must have a system of checks and balances. At the same time, we can reduce the economic efficiency to a smaller space as much as possible. If you don't want the high-quality strength team to be shot by the market, you should have a set of feasible systems to support the high-quality strength team to get rid of the shadow of the market. Whether it is a check bubble or a good quality team, the institutional investors of value investing concept naturally support the value management of market value management through a series of institutional arrangements.\",\"timestamp\":1641523369,\"title\":\"Market value management\"},\"digest\":\"ztHOOe_fHGgjtkKH06DC7Po8EjuOLbyGjaoMvDl9Y3U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5469f22Fc52ad7a5E1f430A75B1Cbd542393DFB0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_IJZL8hXaSkuCIE0tI7n_8ASHLnVeJ_LcxPrrsBZTKY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ggF0A8gJumA5rFLd-qeOi6zBU7F5-iQlcoJHZiI3Q8I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LYwO0qyL1VN7mLGOflCd-D5HJMNy3RbiIk2iZ9hDtI2um1a6u64KEjIl46FeVfUZzeR7lKiSk7A1CfTAkDwSaw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1105db673b7a76229175e1c63d2e72c84c937b1970ce57e5d0e92f90629775416799d177fed0364991d16fb22a28f727d1116e893539b4ebbb2e59a6bda813b01c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_IJZL8hXaSkuCIE0tI7n_8ASHLnVeJ_LcxPrrsBZTKY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ggF0A8gJumA5rFLd-qeOi6zBU7F5-iQlcoJHZiI3Q8I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ztHOOe_fHGgjtkKH06DC7Po8EjuOLbyGjaoMvDl9Y3U\"}"
