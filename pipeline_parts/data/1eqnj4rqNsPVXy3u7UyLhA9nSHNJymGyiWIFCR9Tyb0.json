"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We already know that Bitcoin Cash is the result of Bitcoin's hard fork. In other words, although there are many similarities between the two, there are also important differences.\\n\\nBlock size\\nOne problem with Bitcoin is that as Bitcoin becomes more and more popular, the speed of processing transactions becomes slower and slower. This is because the size of each block is limited to less than 1MB. The SegWit2x protocol had hoped to increase this limit to 2MB. In contrast, Bitcoin Cash does not have SegWit. In 2017, the block size limit was 8MB at the beginning, so transactions are processed much faster. Starting in May 2018, the block limit has been increased to 32MB, and it can be increased again when the cash block is close to the limit.\\n\\nInterestingly, the highly anticipated SegWit2x was not implemented on Bitcoin as scheduled, leading many people to abandon Bitcoin and invest in Bitcoin Cash.\",\"timestamp\":1636028154,\"title\":\"What is the difference between Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash?\"},\"digest\":\"fJSWC4l4DSphbG6xAQndya0nud3NHKHQbYR2E2zeJuo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA2A32B6D68FE3431362785545F4c7bB26Ef33e81\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bJ9HlxMa3yCKK5_IGqJxecLzWTtj-4mN7wBvGJdKdaQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4XtMTyK_Bg5R3juByQ-CQGS6BAMrK19WvA7bRc5cmw0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"P-_IE5w8B9MTvPN6FGd9RrMnYBnPnUwt9wtGI7F3_evb3xv6tLWMl0XKHvuqJ_Qhu1sx32DV7mMpSRulcnXx2Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1705917ed19b8601f7a50c197cd39076dd7b9d97b035300affaa0f865dacfd4351f3ccf43faf9346e3c2afd5dc64de857a6e1d6f685b01153603b83c6f3b024b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bJ9HlxMa3yCKK5_IGqJxecLzWTtj-4mN7wBvGJdKdaQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4XtMTyK_Bg5R3juByQ-CQGS6BAMrK19WvA7bRc5cmw0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fJSWC4l4DSphbG6xAQndya0nud3NHKHQbYR2E2zeJuo\"}"
