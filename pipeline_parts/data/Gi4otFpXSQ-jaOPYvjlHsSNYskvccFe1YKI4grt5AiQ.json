Dogecoin has some inflationary dynamics itself that would make me reluctant to hold it,” the Ripple CEO said.\\n\\nGarlinghouse noted that Dogecoin has no hard limit on the total supply of coins in circulation, which makes it very different from some major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, which is [capped at 21 million coins](https://cointelegraph.com/news/inflationary-winds-from-around-the-world-spell-a-sea-change-for-bitcoin).\\n\\n“It was built as a joke, then it got some momentum from some high-profile people like Elon Musk,” Garlinghouse added.\\n\\nDespite being skeptical about DOGE, Garlinghouse is still optimistic about the cryptocurrency market in general. \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1463214048833540099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1463214048833540099%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fripple-ceo-blasts-dogecoin-for-inflationary-dynamics](https://twitter.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1463214048833540099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1463214048833540099%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcointelegraph.com%2Fnews%2Fripple-ceo-blasts-dogecoin-for-inflationary-dynamics)\\n\\nDogecoin is a cryptocurrency based on the Shiba Inu meme that was launched as a joke back in 2013. The digital currency [started with a supply limit of 100 billion coins](https://cointelegraph.com/dogecoin-for-beginners/what-makes-dogecoin-valuable), which it hit in mid-2015. Since then, Dogecoin was switched to provide an uncapped supply while limiting a reward of 10,000 DOGE per block to keep inflation under control.\\n\\nDOGE has emerged as one of the most successful cryptocurrencies in 2021, [entering the list of the top 10 largest cryptocurrencies](https://cointelegraph.com/news/doge-soars-80-on-the-day-to-become-10th-largest-crypto-by-market-cap) by market capitalization earlier this year. At the time of writing, DOGE is the 10th-most valued digital currency, [trading](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dogecoin) at $0.22, up over 6,000% over the past year.\\n\\nMuch of Dogecoin’s success has apparently been associated with endorsement by Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who [started actively promoting DOGE](https://cointelegraph.com/news/elon-musk-voices-support-for-dogecoin-after-recent-bitcoin-bashing) on Twitter in 2020.\\n\\n![Dogecoin all-time price chart.
