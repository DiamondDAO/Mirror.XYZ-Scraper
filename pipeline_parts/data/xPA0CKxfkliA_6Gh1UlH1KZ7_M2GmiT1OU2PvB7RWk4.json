KB4 is an 8 week experience: an intro to KERNEL, co-created with 200 peers. It is a journey deep into the ♡ of web3.\\n\\nWhen I first stumbled upon Kernel through this article, it immediately pulled me in. These were not mere words, but a feeling communicated with the intention of touching deep within the minds and hearts of readers.\\n\\n<https://kernel.community/en/learn/>\\n\\n![The Eightfold Noble Path](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lNX3nSSVIKNQW17TQU5xo.png?height=1120&width=1622)\\n\\nNot only was it deeply philosophical, it was equally approachable. Deeply personal, yet highly impactful on the environment. Web3, a word which was alienated by technological elitism, felt homely and welcoming to the artist and the coder alike.\\n\\nLike every story you begin with ‘Once upon a time’. To know where web3 comes from and what intentional direction was set. The intentions of people and how more people hijack them and how even more people come to re-instill them. And the same journeys we take in our inner worlds.\\n\\nIt’s important to do a ‘Vibe Check’ in this game of building trust and creating a space, for a centered being to arise!\\n\\nAnd then in this space, you meet people, from all over the world and worlds. Entrepreneurs, Artists, Investors, Builders, Coders, Storytellers, Wanderers, Mystics. One of a kind, of every kind.\\n\\nAnd then we drop all the charade’s of the personality, to be present and share a moment. And in that moment magic happens, intentions manifest through pure connection. A connection beyond time and space.\\n\\nIt’s a connection with yourself in the other.\\n\\n[edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=686](edition://0xDF5b5ee15CC96ba7d0CB6BD9b2c0fc4417ab6445?editionId=686)\\n\\nCome experience that!\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\nThis is an invitation for those excited by this offering from [@KERNEL0x](https://twitter.com/KERNEL0x) to join the upcoming block KB5, which kicks off on the 28th of January, 2022.\\n\\nYou may claim this NFT as a referral from your future [friend](https://twitter.com/anujkodam)!\\n\\nYou still have to apply [here](https://form.typeform.com/to/BU1solRr?utm_source=referral_email#referral=Anuj%20Kumar%20Kodam%2C%20Divya%20).\\n\\nSee you on the other side ❤️\\n\\n\\n---\",\"timestamp\":1636782718,\"title\":\"What is Kernel?\"},\"digest\":\"6eJ2G9KqOKSUAE1kByVBV3B2fJtyNLS8GDx5-07zVlE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7BfE90590179A586080682f149d106b70cb51E3E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_CCvB2_CqzUq4M2JNr20_NN9Myx4KS9_cXRnJMgOobQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7qlUO5S75IJWh14aXCYUO8nKGs7Id1Yr_vDtoCTqK7g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8BUbtcTo9r828fIA2-KJRkuDfd9ce1rLef5LuDxPBIfEcHnrUHU67DbZZMJuOrKJg4Ckz8XsgTDJROlRsdYHUw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x62f3f3bf6df8d28c2019392ced5614f855a3e5c731847e7f7ce5b7037d1059b827416b657b6b04d66b14bbecd71e30b224809d7b46af2f093cd4adcebe18bb241c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_CCvB2_CqzUq4M2JNr20_NN9Myx4KS9_cXRnJMgOobQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"7qlUO5S75IJWh14aXCYUO8nKGs7Id1Yr_vDtoCTqK7g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NOenCnVzH-Wx8eYMf81z0HYKlED-9HeXSzMGwWzENxs\"}"
