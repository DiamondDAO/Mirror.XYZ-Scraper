"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The girls used to keep a little sponge and some water in a discarded patchouli bottle with a glass stopper, to wash their slates with; but it always seemed to me that the human and whole-hearted way was otherwise.\\n\\nReading, writing, and arithmetic, - these three; and the greatest of these three is arithmetic.  Over against it stands grammar, which may be said to be derived from reading and writing.  Show me a man that, as a boy at school, excelled in arithmetic and I will show you a useful citizen, a boss in his own business, a leader of men; show me the boy that preferred grammar, that read expressively, that wrote a beautiful hand and curled his capital S's till their tails looked like mainsprings, and I will show you a dreamer and a sentimentalist - a man that works for other people.  While I have breath in me, I will maintain the supereminence of arithmetic. There is no room for disputation in arithmetic, no exceptions to the rule.  Twice two is four, and that's all there is about it: but whether there be pronunciations, they shall cease; whether there be rules of grammar, they shall vanish away.  Why, look here.  It's a rule of grammar, isn't it, that the subject of a sentence must be put in the nominative case?  Let it kick and bite, and hang on to the desks all it wants to, in it goes and the door is slammed on it. You think so?   What is the word \\\"you?\\\"  Second person, plural number, objective case.  Oh, no; the nominative form is \\\"ye.\\\"\\n\\nDon't you remember it says: \\\"Woe unto you, ye lawyers\\\"?   Those who fight against: \\\"Him and me went down town,\\\" fight against the stars in their courses, for the objective case in every language is bound and determined to be The Whole Thing.  Arithmetic alone is founded on a rock.  All else is fleeting, all else is futile, chaotic - a waste of time.  What is reading but a rival of morphine?  There are probably as many men in prison, sent there by Reading, as by Rum.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, not good Reading!\\\" says the publisher.\\n\\n\\\"Not good Rum, either,\\\" says the publican.\\n\\nFight it out.  It's an even thing between the two of you; Literature and Liquor, Books and Booze, which can take a man's mind off his business most effectually.\\n\\nStill, merely as a matter of taste, I will defend the quality of McGuffey's School Readers against all comers.  I don't know who McGuffey was; but certainly he formed the greatest intellects of our age, present company not excepted.  The true test of literature is its eternal modernity.  A thing of beauty is a joy forever.  It always seems of the age in which it is read.  Now, almost the earliest lection in McGuffey's First Reader goes directly to the heart of one of the greatest of modern problems.  It does not palter or beat about the bush.  It asks right out, plump and plain: \\\"Ann, how old are you?\\\"\\n\\nYear by year, until we reached the dizzy height of the Sixth Reader, were presented to us samples of the best English ever written.  If you can find, up in the garret, a worn and frayed old Reader, take it down and turn its pages over.  See if anything in these degenerate days compares in vital strength and beauty with the story of the boy that climbed the Natural Bridge, carving his steps in the soft limestone with his pocket knife.  You cannot read it without a thrill.  The same inspired hand wrote \\\"The Blind Preacher,\\\" and who that ever can read it can forget the climax reached in that sublime line: \\\"Socrates died like a philosopher, but Jesus Christ like a god!\\\"\\n\\nNot long ago I walked among the graves in that spot opposite where Wall Street slants away from Broadway, and my feet trod on ground worth, in the market, more than the twenty-dollar gold pieces that would cover it.  My eye lighted upon a flaking brownstone slab, that told me Captain Michael Cresap rested there.  Captain Michael Cresap!  The intervening years all fled away before me, and once again my boyish heart thrilled with that incomparable oration in McGuffey's Reader, \\\"Who is there to mourn for Logan?  Not one.\\\" Captain Cresap was the man that led the massacre of Logan's family.\\n\\nAnd there was more than good literature in those Readers.  There was one piece that told about a little boy alone upon a country road at night.  The black trees groaned and waved their skinny arms at him.  The wind-torn clouds fitfully let a pale and watery moonlight stream a little through.  It was very lonely.  Over his shoulder the boy saw indistinct shapes that followed after, and hid themselves whenever he looked squarely at them.  Then, suddenly, he saw before him in the gloom, a gaunt white specter waiting for him - waiting to get him, its arms spread wide out in menace.  He was of our breed, though, this boy.  He did not turn and run.  With God knows what terror knocking at his ribs, he trudged ahead to meet his fate, and lo! the grisly specter proved to be a friendly guide-post to show the way that he should walk in. Brother (for you are my kin that went with me to public school, in the life that you have lived since you first read the story of Harry and the Guide-post, has it been an idle tale, or have you, too, found that what we dreaded most, what seemed to us so terrible in the future has, after all, been a friendly guide-post, showing us the way that we should walk in?\\n\\nMcGuffey had a Speller, too.  It began with simple words in common use, like a-b ab, and e-b eb, and i-b, ib, proceeding by gradual, if not by easy stages to honorificatudinibility and disproportionableness, with a department at the back devoted to twisters like phthisic, and mullein-stalk, and diphtheria, and gneiss.  We used to have a fine old sport on Friday afternoons, called \\\"choose-up-and-spell-down.\\\"  I don't know if you ever played it.  It was a survival, pure and simple, from the Old Red School-house.  There was where it really lived.  There was where it flourished as a gladiatorial spectacle.  The crack spellers of District Number 34 would challenge the crack spellers of the Sinking Spring School.  The whole countryside came to the school-house in wagons at early candle-lighting time, and watched them fight it out. The interest grew as the contest narrowed down, until at last there were the two captains left - big John Rice for District Number 34, and that wiry, nervous, black-haired girl of 'Lias Hoover's, Polly Ann.  She married a man by the name of Brubaker.  I guess you didn't know him.  His folks moved here from Clarke County.  Polly Ann's eyes glittered like a snake's, and she kept putting her knuckles up to the red spots in her cheeks that burned like fire.  Old John, he didn't seem to care a cent.  And what do you think Polly Ann missed on?  \\\"Feoffment.\\\"  A simple little word like \\\"feoffment!\\\" She hadn't got further than pheph -- \\\" when she knew that she was wrong, but Teacher had said \\\"Next!\\\" and big John took it and spelled it right.  She had a fit of nervous crying, and some were for giving her the victory, after all, because she was a lady.  But big John said: \\\"She missed, didn't she?  Well.  And I spelled it right, didn't I?   Well.  She took her chances same as the rest of us.  'Taint me you got to consider, it's District Number 34.  And furthermore.  AND FURTHERMORE.  Next time somebuddy asts her to go home with him from singin'-school, mebby she won't snigger right in his face, and say 'No! 's' loud 'at everybuddy kin hear it.\\\"\\n\\nIt's quite a thing to be a good speller, but there are people who can spell any word that ever was, and yet if you should ask them right quick how much is seven times eight, they'd hem and haw and say: \\\"Seven tums eight?  Why - ah, lemme see now.  Seven tums - what was it you said?   Oh, seven tums eight.  Why - ah, seven tums eight is sixty-three - fifty-six I mean.\\\"  There's nothing really to spelling.  It's just an idiosyncrasy.  If there was really anything useful in it, you could do it by machinery -just the same as you can add by machinery, or write with a typewriter, or play the piano with one of these things with cut paper in it. Spelling is an old-fashioned, hand-powered process, and as such doomed to disappear with the march of improvement.\\n\\nOne Friday afternoon we chose up and spelled down, and the next Friday afternoon we spoke pieces.  Doubtless this accounts for our being a nation of orators.  I am far from implying or seeming to imply that this is anything to brag of.  Anybody that can be influenced by a man with a big mouth, a loud voice, and a rush of words to the face - well, I've got my opinion of all such.\\n\\nOratory and poetry - all foolishness, I say.  Better far are drawing-lessons, and raffia-work, and clay-modeling than: \\\"I come not here to talk,\\\" and \\\"A soldier of the Legion lay dying at Algiers,\\\" and \\\"Old Ironsides at anchor lay.\\\"  (I observe that these lines are more or less familiar to you, and that you are eager to add selections to the list, all of them known to me as well as you.) That children, especially boys, loathe to speak a piece is a fact profoundly significant.  They know it is nothing in the world but foolishness; and if there is one thing above another that a child hates, it is to be made a fool in public.  That's what makes them work their fingers so, and gulp, and stammer, and tremble at the knees.  That is what sends them to their seats, after all is over, mad as hornets.  This is something that I know about.  It happened that, instead of getting funny pieces to recite as I wanted to, discerning that one silly turn deserves another, my parents, well-meaning in their way, taught me solemn things about: \\\"O man immortal, live for something!\\\" and all such, and I had to humiliate myself by disgorging them in public.  The consequence was, that not only on Friday afternoons but whenever anybody came to visit the school, I was butchered to make a Roman holiday.  Teacher was so proud of me, and the visitors let on that they were tickled half to death, but I knew better.  I could see the other scholars look at one another, as much as to say: \\\"Well, if you'll tell me why!\\\" Even in my shame and anger I could see that.  But there is one happy memory of a Friday afternoon.  Determined to show my friends and fellow-citizens that I, too, was born in Arcadia, and was a living, human boy, I announced to Teacher: \\\"I got another piece.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, have you?\\\" cried she, sure of an extra O-man-immortal intellectual treat.  \\\"Let us hear it, by all means.\\\"\\n\\nWhereupon I marched up to the platform and declaimed that deathless lyric:\\n\\n\\\"When I was a boy, I was a bold one. My mammy made me a new shirt out o' dad's old one.\\\"\\n\\nAll of it?  Certainly.  Isn't that enough?   That was the only distinctly popular platform effort I ever made.  I am proud of it now.  I was proud of it then.  But the news of my triumph was coldly received at home.\\n\\nI don't know whether it has since gone out of date, but in my day and time a very telling feature of school exhibitions was reading in concert.  The room was packed as full of everybody's ma as it could be, and yet not mash the children out of shape, and a whole lot of young ones would read a piece together.  Fine?   Finest thing you ever heard.  I remember one time teacher must have calculated a leetle mite too close, or else one girl more was in the class than she had reckoned on; but on the day, the two end girls just managed to stand upon the platform and that was all. They recited together:\\n\\n\\\"There was a sound of revelry by night And Belgium's capital . . . . \\\"\\n\\nI forget the rest of it.  Well, anyhow, they were supposed to make gestures all together.  Teacher had rehearsed the gestures, and they all did it simultaneously, just as if they had been wound up with a spring.  But, as I said, the two end girls had all they could do to keep on the platform, and it takes elbow room for: \\\"'T is but the car rattling over the stony street,\\\" and one girl - well, she said she stepped off on purpose, but I didn't believe her then and I don't now.  We had our laugh about it, whichever way it was.\\n\\nWe had our laugh . . . . Ah, life was all laughter then.  That was before care came to be the shadow at our heel.  That was before black Sorrow met us in the way, and would not let us pass unless we gave to her our dearest treasure.  That was before we learned that what we covet most is, when we get it, but a poor thing after all, that whatsoever chalice Fortune presses to our lips, a tear is in the bottom of the cup.  In those happy days gone by if the rain fell, 't was only for a little while, and presently the sky was bright again, and the birds whistled merrily among the wet and shining leaves.  Now \\\"the clouds return after the rain.\\\"\\n\\nIt can never be with us again as once it was.  For us the bell upon the Old Red School-house calls in vain.  We heed it not, we that hearkened for it years ago.  The living tide of youth flows toward the school-house, and we are not of it.  Never again shall we sit at those old desks, whittled and carved with rude initials, and snap our fingers, eager to tell the answer.  Never again shall we experience the thrill of pride when teacher praised us openly. Never again shall we sit trembling while the principal, reads the note, and then scowls at us fiercely with: \\\"Take off your coat, sir!\\\"  Ah, me!  Never again, never again.\\n\\nWell, who wants it to be that way again?  We're men and women now. We've duties and responsibilities.  Who wants to be a child again? Not I.  Let me stick just at my present age for about a hundred years, and I'll never utter a word of complaint.\\n\\nTHE SABBATH-SCHOOL\\n\\n```\\n \\\"We-a love the Sunday-school.       We-a love the Sunday-school.       (Girls) - So do I.       (Boys)-So do I.       (School) - We all love the Sunday-school.\\\"\\n```\\n\\nSPARKLING DEWDROPS.\\\"\\n\\nSome people believe that when General Conference assigned them to the Committee on Hymn-Book Revision, power and authority were given unto them to put a half-sole and a new heel on any and all poetry that might look to them to be a little run over on one side.  If they felt as I do about the lines that head this article they would have \\\"Sunday\\\" scratched out and \\\"Sabbath\\\" written in before you could bat an eye.  The mere substitution of one word for another may seem a light matter to a man that has never composed anything more literary than an obituary for the Western Advocate of Sister Jane Malinda Sprague, who was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, in 1816, removed with her parents at a tender age to New Sardis, Washington County, Ohio, where, etc., etc.  If he wanted to extract a word he would do it, and never even offer to give the author gas.  But I know just how it hurts.  I know or can imagine how the gifted poet that penned the deathless lines I have quoted must have walked the floor in an agony until every word and syllable was just to suit him, and so, though I feel sure he meant to write \\\"Sabbath-school,\\\" I don't dare change it.\\n\\nTo most persons one word seems about as good as another, Sunday or Sabbath, but when there are young people about the house you learn to be careful how you talk before them.  Now, I would not go so far as to say that \\\"Sunday\\\" is what you might call exactly rowdy, but er . . . but . . . er . . . Let me illustrate.  If a man says, \\\"It's a beautiful Sunday morning,\\\" like enough he has on red-and-green stockings, baggy knickerbockers, a violet-and-purple sweater, a cap shaped like a milk-roll, and is smoking a pipe.  He very likely carries a bagful of golf-sticks, or is pumping up his bicycle. But if a man says, \\\"This beautiful Sabbath morn,\\\" you know for a certainty that he wears a long-tailed black coat, a boiled shirt, and a white tie.  He is bald from his forehead upward, his upper lip is shaven, and his views and those of the late Robert Reed on the disgusting habit of using tobacco are absolutely at one.\\n\\nNot alone a regard for respectability, but the hankering to be historically accurate, urges me to make the change I speak of. Originally the institution was a Sunday-school, and not very respectable either.  I should hate to think any of my dear young friends were in the habit of attending such a low-class affair as Robert Raikes conducted.  Sunday-schools were for \\\"little ragamuffins,\\\" as he called them, who worked such long hours on week-days (from five in the morning until nine at night) that if they were to learn the common branches at all it had to be on a Sunday.  A ragged school was bad enough in itself, putting foolish notions into the heads of gutter-brats and making them discontented and unhappy in their lot; but to teach a ragged school on Sunday was a little too much.  So Robert Raikes encountered the most violent opposition, although from that beginning dates popular education in England.\\n\\nTo be able to read is no Longer a sign that Pa can afford to do without the young ones' wages on a Saturday night, and can even pay for their schooling.  It is no longer a mark of wealth or even of hard-won privilege, but the common fate of all; to know the three R's, and Sunday is not now set apart for secular instruction.  So good and wholesome an institution as the Sunday-school was not permitted to perish, but was changed to suit the environment.  It is now become the Sabbath-school for the study of the Bible, a Christian recrudescence of the synagogue.  For some eighteen centuries it was supposed that a regularly ordained minister should have exclusive charge of this work.  At rare intervals nowadays a clergyman may be found to maintain that because a man has been to college and to the theological seminary, and has made the study of the Scriptures his life-work (moved to that decision after careful self-examination) that therefore he is better fitted to that ministry than Miss Susie Goldrick, who teaches a class in Sabbath-school very acceptably.  Miss Goldrick is in the second year in the High School, and last Friday afternoon read a composition on English Literatoor, in which she spoke in terms of high praise of John Bunion, the well-known author of \\\" Progress and Poverty.\\\"  Miss Goldrick is very conscientious, and always keeps her thumbnail against the questions printed on the lesson-leaf, so as not to ask twice, \\\"What did the disciples then do?\\\"\\n\\nIt were a grave error to suppose that no secular learning is acquired in the modern Sabbath-school.  I remember once, when quite young, speaking to my teacher, in the interval between the regular class work and the closing exercises, about peacocks.  I had read of them, but had never seen one.  What did they look like?  She said a peacock was something like a butterfly.  I have always remembered that, and when I did finally see a peacock, I was interested to note the essential accuracy of the description.\\n\\nAlso, one day a new lady taught our class, Miss Evans having gone up to Marion to spend a Sunday with her brother, who kept a stove store there, and this new lady borrowed two flower vases from off the pulpit and a piece of string from Turkey-egg McLaughlin to explain to us boys how the earth went around the sun.  We had too much manners to tell her that we knew that years and years ago when we were in Miss Humphreys's room.  I don't remember what the earth going around the sun had to do with the lesson for the day, which was about Samuel anointing David's head with oil - did I ever tell you how I anointed my own head with coal oil? - but I do remember that she broke both the vases and cut her finger, and had to keep sucking it the rest of the time, because she didn't want to get her handkerchief all bloodied up.  It was a kind of fancy handkerchief, made of thin stuff trimmed with lace - no good.\\n\\nThe Sabbath-school may be said to be divided into three courses, namely, the preparatory or infant-class, the collegiate or Sabbath-school proper, and the post-graduate or Mr. Parker's Bible-class.\\n\\nWhat can a mere babe of three or four years learn in Sabbath-school? sneers the critic.  Not much, I grant you, of justification by Faith, or Effectual Calling; but certain elementary precepts can be impressed upon the mind while it is still in a plastic condition that never can be wholly obliterated, come what may in after life. Prime among these elementary precepts is this: \\\"Always bring a penny.\\\"\\n\\nSome one has said, \\\"Give me the first seven years of a child's life and I care not who has the remainder.\\\"  I cannot endorse this without reserve; but I maintain as a demonstrated fact: \\\"Bring up a child to contribute a copper cent, and when he is old he will not depart from it.\\\"  It was recently my high privilege to attend a summer gathering of representative religious people in the largest auditorium in this country.  Sometimes under that far-spreading roof ten thousand souls were assembled and met together.  This fact could be guessed at with tolerable accuracy from the known seating capacity, but the interesting thing was that it could be predicated with mathematical certainty that exactly ten thousand people were present, because the offertory footed up exactly one hundred dollars. What an encouragement to these faithful infant-class teachers that have labored unremittingly, instant in season and out of season, saying over and over again with infinite patience, \\\"Always bring a penny,\\\" to know that their labor has not been in vain, and that as a people we have made it the rule of our lives always to bring a penny - and no more.\\n\\nI have often tried to think what a Sabbath-school must be like in California, where they have no pennies.  It seems hardly possible that the institution can exist under such a patent disability, and yet it does.  Do they work it on the same principle as the post-office in that far-off land where you 'cannot buy one postal card because the postmaster cannot make change, but must buy five postal cards or two two-cent stamps and a postal?  In other words, does a nickel, the smallest extant coin, serve for five persons for one Sunday or one person for five Sundays?   I have often wondered about this.\\n\\nSubsidiary instruction in the preparatory course consists of sitting right still and being nice, keeping your fingers out of Johnny Pym's eye, because it hurts him and makes him cry, not grabbing in the basket when it goes by, even though it does have pennies in it, coaching in a repertory of songs like: \\\"Beautiful, Beautiful Little Hands,\\\" \\\"You in Your Little Corner and I in Mine,\\\" \\\" The Consecrated Cross-Eyed Bear,\\\" \\\"Pass Around the Wash-Rag\\\" - the grown folks call that \\\"Pass Along the Watchword\\\" and stories about David and Goliath, Samson and the three hundred foxes with fire tied to their tails, Moses in the bulrushes, the infant Samuel, Hagar in the wilderness, and so forth.  The clergy have often objected that these stories, being told at the same period of life with those about Santa Claus, \\\"One time there was a little boy and he had a dog named Rover,\\\" the little girl that had hair as black as ebony, skin as white as snow, and cheeks as red as blood, because her Ma, who was a queen by occupation, happened to cut her finger with a black-handled knife along about New Year's - the clergy, I say, have often objected that all these matters, being brought to a child's attention at the same period in its life, are likely to be regarded in after years as of equal evidential value.  I am not much of a hand to argue, myself, but I should like to have one of these carping critics meet my friend, Mrs. Sarah M. Boggs, who has taught the infant-class since 1867, having missed only two Sundays in that time, once, in 1879, when it stormed so that nobody in town was out, and once, last winter a year ago, when she slipped off the back porch and hurt her knee.  I can just see Sister Boggs laying down the law to anybody that finds fault with the infant-class, let him be preacher or who. Why the very idea!  Do you mean to say, sir - I guess Sister Boggs can straighten him out all right.\\n\\nNo less faithful is Mr. Parker, the leading lawyer of the town, who conducts the Bible-class.  I believe one morning he didn't get there until after the last bell was done ringing, but otherwise his record of attendance compares favorably with Sister Boggs's.  Both teachers agree to ignore the stated lesson for the day, but whereas Sister Boggs leads her flock through the flowery meads of narration, Mr. Parker and his class have camped out by preference for the last forty years in the arid wilderness of Romans and Hebrews and Corinthians First and Second, flinging the plentiful dornicks of \\\"Paul says this\\\" and \\\"Paul says that\\\" at each other's heads in friendly strife.  Mr. Parker's class is also very assiduous in its attendance upon the Young People's meetings, seemingly holding the dogma, \\\"Once a young person always a young person.\\\"  The prevailing style of hairdressing among the members is to grow the locks long on the left side of the head, and to bring the thin layer across to the right, pasted down very carefully with a sort of peeled onion effect.\\n\\nThere is a whole lot of them, and they jower away at each other all through the time between the opening and the closing exercises, having the liveliest kind of a time getting over about two verses of the Bible and the whole ground of speculative theology.\\n\\nImmeasurably more impermanent in method and personnel is the regular collegiate department, the Sabbath-school proper.  In the early days, away back when sugar was sixteen cents a pound, the thing to do was to learn Scripture verses by heart.  If you were a rude, rough boy who didn't exactly love the Sunday-school as much as the hymn made you say you did, but still one who had rather sing it than stir up a muss, you hunted for the shortest verses you could find and said them off.  From four to eight was considered a full day's work.  But if you were a boy who put on an apron and helped your Ma with the dishes, a boy who always wiped your feet before you came in, a boy that never got kept in at school, a boy that cried pretty easy, a nice, pale boy, with bulging blue eyes, you came to Sabbath-school and disgorged verses like buck-shot out of a bag.  The four-to-eight-verse boys sat and listened, and improved their minds. There was generally one other boy like you in the class, and it was nip-and-tuck between you which should get the prize, until finally you came one Sunday, all bloated up with 238 verses in your craw, and he quit discouraged.  The prize was yours.  It was a beautiful little Bible with a brass clasp; it had two tiny silk strings of an old-gold color for bookmarks, and gilt edges all around that made the leaves stick together at first.  It was printed in diamond type, so small it made your ears ring when you tried to read it.\",\"timestamp\":1639992898,\"title\":\"Forget the steps already trod,       And onward urge thy way\"},\"digest\":\"5QvGk2_ocDruLd7kNWJx1KsYtCfQnCZQ2fwFHdjH0Zo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF837B0f31262404317f5574c591fE54602BaE0be\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RyZsN0vz9knk2ZTaYY9Pp-Ob0s4tXtxcOFy-6Ps3Gx0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZgTMG4w-Gw1mXotJ8qn_YVTRQeJHeIf9mAOx2jKioVo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-y2Cjr_Ziww-fR4aO5imuBbnWbHlgG3KYGleIMnykgQhHFNdu99-J6WtZOCNecF2TZP9sGeY3CVgVMTo6o5-cw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5ce984265d3c6fe532dfa6e9e9b5f4f8076e4e4c7aebb2279a459f547e59f99543dc9f1ddcbc80b8c62dd8a6e3dd0527677aa1bf46650ed5bff79d601e4b3e361b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RyZsN0vz9knk2ZTaYY9Pp-Ob0s4tXtxcOFy-6Ps3Gx0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZgTMG4w-Gw1mXotJ8qn_YVTRQeJHeIf9mAOx2jKioVo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5QvGk2_ocDruLd7kNWJx1KsYtCfQnCZQ2fwFHdjH0Zo\"}"
