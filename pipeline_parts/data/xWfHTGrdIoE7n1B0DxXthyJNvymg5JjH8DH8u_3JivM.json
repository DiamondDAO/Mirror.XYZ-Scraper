Treasure revolves around rewarding its users through innovative methods of play to earn, free mints ,airdrops and plenty more. Its safe to say treasure marketplace is just getting started. ~~metaverse~~\\n\\nGiven the recent congestion on the Ethereum main net, a few layer 2 solutions have been proposed.\\n\\nWhy is that, you may ask? The reason is GWEI!\\n\\nArbitrum is one of these Layer 2 solutions. Users are able to bridge over using [Hop](https://app.hop.exchange/send?token=ETH&sourceNetwork=ethereum&destNetwork=arbitrum) Protocol and, once over, are able to use the network without having to worry about costly and slow gas transactions.\\n\\nTreasure has managed to establish itself on Arbitrum over the short period since its launched. It has also influenced adoption of the network for people newer into the space via Free to claim NFTs, with the only requirements being “use Arbitrum”\\n\\nMany users who have bridged over for the first time, have ended up staying given the positive experience they’ve had with the marketplace and the endless surprises from the team / community. All that and Gas-friendly prices to interact on chain!\\n\\n## Where did it come from and how does it all work?..\\n\\n“[Treasure Project](https://opensea.io/collection/treasure-for-loot)” is a randomized set of 8 words on the Ethereum blockchain. Each word has a scarcity which represents the “rarities” and only 9,000 total sets exist. After the project’s initial sell out and through developing traction over time, Treasure Project has been able to establish a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization.) The DAO revolved around the Treasure project, which contributed to building a community interested in longevity and growth, as demonstrated by the recent migration to Arbitrum.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lSD7CQE_3Iy-G8jyZtP9X.png?height=1059&width=468)\\n\\nTreasure Marketplace was developed by [@jpatten](https://twitter.com/jpatten) and [@_gaarping](https://twitter.com/_gaarping)(anon). Alongside the community involved in the DAO, Treasure has created its own ecosystem in the form of a coin called $MAGIC. This is the core currency used to purchase and sell NFTS on the marketplace and it forms the key element in some of the play 2 earn mechanics.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/s3R1rXTOSF-SUvm1f4nSv.png?height=230&width=445)\\n\\n## How to obtain $MAGIC\\n\\nOnce you are on [the Arbitrum network](https://help.uniswap.org/en/articles/5538707-how-to-connect-to-arbitrum). There are a few ways to obtain $MAGIC, Treasure is actively developing innovative pathways for users to earn $MAGIC through fun and unconventional means. Some methods of earning $MAGIC have been listed below.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Treasure_NFT/status/1466476037949304836](https://twitter.com/Treasure_NFT/status/1466476037949304836)\\n\\n### Buying $MAGIC on an Exchange\\n\\nOnce you have used HOP protocol to bridge your currency of choice, you are able to directly swap using a Decentralized exchange, such as [Sushiswap](https://app.sushi.com/swap?inputCurrency=&outputCurrency=0x539bdE0d7Dbd336b79148AA742883198BBF60342) Once you have swapped you are able to interact with the marketplace using your $MAGIC.\\n\\n[https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/magic](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/magic)\\n\\n### Through the Treasure Project\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/68683J9pemN9dtbEKtyz0.png?height=517&width=341)\\n\\nWhen Users migrate their “[Treasure Project](https://opensea.io/collection/treasure-for-loot)” Arbitrum (steps on the discord), it gets dispersed into 8 NFTS, with each NFT representing one of the words in your bag.\\n\\nAs the Treasure project is the origins of the marketplace and the motif behind the marketplace it has been hinted that they will have a more important role with how users can interact and earn rewards in the ecosystem, not all the utility behind these have been revealed yet…however they have hinted into “quest” which users have speculated will be ways to use your Treasure NFTS to participate in games for $MAGIC as bounty.\\n\\n![Treasure after its been migrated (Its animated)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/6ZV6qqtY-8wPFrrUmOQ5Y.png?height=282&width=222)\\n\\nAlternatively, you are able to purchase individual loots from the [Treasures marketplace](https://marketplace.treasure.lol/collection/0xEBba467eCB6b21239178033189CeAE27CA12EaDf), which is a secondary market place which utilizes $MAGIC.\\n\\n**Single Sided Staking** -\\n\\n***“The Treasure economy hinges on MAGIC staking. The more magic that has been staked, the more MAGIC that is emitted from the mine.”***\\n\\n$MAGIC represents the gears that power the Treasure ecosystem. Consequently, there are a few mechanics to incentivize users to stake their $MAGIC, while earning decent rewards.\\n\\nTo single side stake, you have the option to lock in your $MAGIC for 2 weeks at a current 120% boost, or alternatively, 150% boost for one month lock up.\\n\\nThe more total supply of $MAGIC that is staked from the circulating supply, the higher the yield rewards. Currently 80% of the circulating supply is locked. (probably nothing)\\n\\nAnother perk of Arbitrum is shown here. Staking your $MAGIC requires minimal fees.\\n\\n![Some Methods of staking + Description of the rewards](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0k9S4hRlslmDJ-IgTVKrg.PNG?height=522&width=924)\\n\\n## NFTS + P2E\\n\\nThe NFTS in the marketplace are built around having a core Utility function. With different collections on the marketplace each having unique functions, with some being direct ways of boosting your $MAGIC yield, to others being a passive income generator and many more,\\n\\nSome of the biggest drops on treasure have been totally free, illustrating once again how community driven the project is and cementing the Treasure Project as one of the first marketplaces to actively look to reward their users and investors.\\n\\nThe most recent drop that has taken a big leap towards mass adoption, both to Arbitrum and the marketplace, has been[“Smol Brains”](https://medium.com/@SMOLBRAINS/smol-brains-a-beginners-guide-268e1b24aab8) a fun, play to earn NFT where the Profile picture can be staked to earn IQ which results in getting a bigger head and some other mechanics that will be introduced as a way of farming $MAGIC.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m_XU2PBE6D6HJdarY8PXi.png?height=827&width=902)\\n\\nTo be legible to claim this drop, the Smol Brains community was simply encouraged to submit a drawing of their version of a smol brain as a human check. Users that completed this task were entitled to claim of 3 NFTS for free. Since their intial launch, these NFTs have traded over 5 Million $MAGIC (1000 Eth) in volume in the last couple weeks alone\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/steviespeaks/status/1468400496453066754?s=21](https://twitter.com/steviespeaks/status/1468400496453066754?s=21)\\n\\n### Treasures plans for the future?\\n\\nTreasure started as an ambitious and innovative project that has not stopped delivering to their community and holders. So far the teams involved have announced free mints and airdrops coming to holders, unique plans to incentivize rewarding users.\\n\\nAs we lean towards more mass adoption and as layer 2 networks become more relative in the space, I believe the Treasure project will be a big player in the NFT/ Gaming marketplace. With plans to expand into the Metaverse, huge partnerships being announced and a whole interactive play to earn world coming to its users, Treasure Project is definitely something to keep your eye on.\\n\\n![Treasures Roadmap ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/dHpEM-kMI5a3WJC28m9fk.png?height=758&width=615)\\n\\n[https://www.treasure.lol/](https://www.treasure.lol/)\\n\\n[https://discord.com/invite/CzRPER6S5K](https://discord.com/invite/CzRPER6S5K)\\n\\n[https://medium.com/@TreasureNFT](https://medium.com/@TreasureNFT)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Treasure_NFT](https://twitter.com/Treasure_NFT)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638957108,\"title\":\"Treasure Marketplace\"},\"digest\":\"CUDFPd-0ymaKnuhkAOuGhQlxlba-V2zc_UW07sjvNo4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x82674C58211C0134348B016810Db718b832d4233\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"teu6du0rC2KX097YVoBAWLE1PA4YWXHQE4-5POpgSEA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5oaOfHNLv8wtW2jQvPIcuBy4B8uiwfmPLgvCZw0kJNE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ROUra7GRkBemnzpFInvUQwvY4EUmeelGtRs4wPrU2QrnmZK5IxP-cCrBBT5mejPKxHAifX4uJK4l5qV1r1c22Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xec7ecb4c63419f6c4ef6aaff0186ea62fbc68786f16f96458c081aea9640753e371e76fc365a05688999932d45f538343818e497451c241f819aa1997eba73171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"teu6du0rC2KX097YVoBAWLE1PA4YWXHQE4-5POpgSEA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5oaOfHNLv8wtW2jQvPIcuBy4B8uiwfmPLgvCZw0kJNE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fJDmwQu3FvPecGBa00VwRgNjcLzSEY1TMsv4iquc4F4\"}"
