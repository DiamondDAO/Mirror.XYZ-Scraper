"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"This is bad. I'm ruined today, too. Is it better to do fortune-telling than to consult with people?\\\"\\nThe man sighs and walks out of the booth. Just past midnight, when people and billboards aren't visible, some rumbling sound is coming.\\n\\\"Hey, kiddo! Can you do some fortune-telling for me?\\\"\\nThe man looks back. Behind the man stands a thick-dressed old man. There was a large box collecting wagon next to him.\\n\\\"Yes, gentleman! It's cold. Let's go inside.\\\"\\n\\nThe two are inside the booth. One lantern on the table brightens the booth.\\n\\\"20Nyang per 50 minutes, is it okay?\\\"\\nThe old man pulls crumpled bills out of pocket.\\nThe man is happy, but he speaks with a calm heart.\\n\\\"What would you like to see about? About romance? About riches?\\\"\\n\\\"About my boy. Can you tell me if my son is doing good?\\\"\\nThe man stops talking.\\n\\\"Can't you get in touch with your son?\\\"\\n\\\"It's been 20 years since I couldn't get in touch. My son has gone for war, and I don't have any news.\\\"\\n\\\"You and your son must've had hard times because of the war.\\\"\\n\\\"I'm all right. It is my son who is active on the frontline. All I can do is just worry about my son.\\\"\\n\\\"No, gentleman. War doesn't only just hurt the body. It also breaks the heart.\\\"\\nA man looks at the old man with warm eyes. \\\"For 20 years, you also had pain.\\\"\\nThe old man doesn't say anything. The man pulls out the Oracle card.\\n\\\"Pick three cards.\\\"\\nThe man and the old man picked three cards. The card is telling bad results. The man puts the card away.\\n\\\"Any problem, kiddo?\\\"\\n\\\"Your son is good. But he's doing something important right now, so he is busy.\\\"\\n\\\"Is it important enough that he can't even contact his family?\\\"\\n\\\"There are so many things in the world that I can't help but do. Your son is one of them. But your son will surely be back. He's going to come back with a big gift for you.\\\"\\nThe man takes a moment to breathe and speaks.\\n\\\"So gentleman, wear warm clothes and don't skip meals. You should stay healthy for the time you meet your son.\\\"\\n\\nThe old man goes out of the booth. The man also goes out to farewell.\\n\\\"Thank you, kiddo. I don't know what to say.\\\" \\\"You paid me, so no need to say so. Stay safe!\\\"\\nThe man looks gravely at the old man's back as he disappears into the dark mist.\\n\\\"Hungry, I have to go to the chicken coop.\\\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, in a desert on another continent, a man is looking at a photo. The photo shows an old man and a child.\\n\\\"Captain, are you looking at your father's picture again?\\\"\\nThe man laughs without words.\",\"timestamp\":1640151289,\"title\":\"Hans the Therapist -2-\"},\"digest\":\"7rRRxrHVotOsBKkLv2-NWGKSsTy3709s_DI3qzEzM_4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2d2Cc67274D30D34a5530a9dDae2a470bD534a9F\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Yxw40WvF1ohXecQk5YFXCJCPzbaO9qCmb6IbpCanVDk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iSN2O7C4kruxip6QLra5Gla_gIc-qg6RpUE-yTUBJ5M\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6duorZZocCBupTq4AJ0fbp2Z7XWmtFsQ3rhh3xjYi7odrw67BUQSz2hqEUqWRzP7oNE3ckb4pEQPsXeX4psd2Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3d3233f1271de91c412242e262dc8eed2a12447b4f2199164b4bb917d2080b2d291623b5903ce846120bdf4ce4407722ca401ad4e31e23f7333c6e0af0dde6cc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Yxw40WvF1ohXecQk5YFXCJCPzbaO9qCmb6IbpCanVDk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"iSN2O7C4kruxip6QLra5Gla_gIc-qg6RpUE-yTUBJ5M\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7rRRxrHVotOsBKkLv2-NWGKSsTy3709s_DI3qzEzM_4\"}"
