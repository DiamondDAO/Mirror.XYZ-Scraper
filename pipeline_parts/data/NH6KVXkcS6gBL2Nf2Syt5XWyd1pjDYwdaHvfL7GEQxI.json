"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> *Shout-out to [Art Coal](https://mirror.xyz/0x253B77d9100E39601Ee01b4e5567a5fc8E878A81/yvBxK-RqZu-Kc5nbkgXyDRQmajg71uXj0MEYAaRSnxc) for the idea to write this!!!*\\n\\nSoon I’ll be launching a crowdfunding campaign to create a DAO; though I need to make sure I have enough ETH for gas-fees before I do; and I would like to gauge and grow the interest in this project, before I launch it :)\\n\\nPlease share [this page](https://mirror.xyz/0x37EDCc3A545F148706086d61507fC27e98990E3e/CMabCrgBd76SHBbdPbai_wl7F7JTQXMNuJEI5hFrIYk) and give me your feedback via twitter **[@CultureClap](https://twitter.com/ArtCoal2) / [@DFLDAO](https://twitter.com/DFLDAO) or [join the Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs)** to further discuss.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lNZQXIPJ9hvQ1JaA0OFSB.jpg?height=1024&width=1536&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&size=large)\\n\\nI’ve been searching for the (open-source) tools to build the community I knew was possible, and web3 is bringing these tools to life.\\n\\nNow, I’m seeking investment in my *laboratory*… presenting the ***DFLDAO:*** *DreamFreely Laboratory DAO*.\\n\\n## Basics\\n\\nProject Title: **DFLDAO**\\nToken: $ DFLD\\nMy Share: 90%\\nFunding Goals: 10 ETH\\nContribution Limit: 20 ETH\\n\\n## NFT Tiers\\n\\n1 ETH, Supply: 6, NFT:  $ Pass (image)\\n0\\\\.5 ETH, Supply: 8, NFT: x0 Pass (image)\\n0\\\\.25 ETH, Supply: 16, NFT: @ Pass (image)\\n\\n***All*** Mirror contributors will receive an individual/unique NFT as well. I am a developer by trade; excited to grow in the ways of web3 technology through Solidity and Rust. You will be the initial recipients of my output (audio NFTs, [music and poetry](https://soundcloud.com/cultureclap/sets/latest).)\\n\\n## The Build\\n\\nWhile a few products already exist, and are in various phases of deployments, all aspects of the DFLDAO are meant to be educational; moreover, the entire operation maintains transparent financials (using GNUCash.)\\n\\nA first step is to zero-out the initial burn rate of the laboratory’s primary creator, me, Culture Clap; by purchasing a plot of land in Colombia. There I will gather my own water, grow my own food, and use renewable energy sources to power the laboratory. The completed cost of this is estimated to be about $25,000 USD.\\n\\nThis land itself will be *worked* *with* into a space for education, as a rural language academy in Latin America, and food forest.\\n\\n## Help is Needed\\n\\nI do have a small team around me, but our expertise is in the operation of our work; not in technology-at-large, business, finances or ***the legal and tax ramifications of operating an international company***.\\n\\nRaising through a Mirror crowdfund is the perfect way strengthen these weaknesses while providing recompense for the effort, access and insight. Tokens provide the mechanism for access, ownership and decision-making.\\n\\n## The Projects\\n\\nEverything is centered around an essence of learning. Our primary product is [idioke, a tool for improving pronunciation](https://www.idioke.com) in a target language. The hook being that users receive ***personalized daily feedback*** … all for $10 USD per month.\\n\\nThe next project is [Rebel Coding, a series of programs and tools](https://www.rebelcoding.com) designed to on-board those interested in computer programming through web development. Both of which feed into a third project located at [screamfreely.org](https://www.screamfreely.org).\\n\\n*This* being an incredibly brief overview of the initial DFL ecosystem; I’ve also started building ***[a small library in public](https://library.dreamfreely.org)***, covering a few other topics.\\n\\n## The Kicker\\n\\n***[idioke is the primary candidate for immediate web3 integration.](https://www.idioke.com)***\\n\\n***Theory:*** idioke receives submissions from users, and pays in a token that can be exchanged for fiat; *how*, is the only question. Though here also is where our work begins to bridge web3 technologies and those in developing countries.\\n\\n***Functional, proof of concept, mobile applications have been built***, and are on the cusp of limited deployment to alpha-testers.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/-4zqGqBaPqdUZNv3GskAj.png?height=970&width=1920)\\n\\n## 90% Retained Ownership\\n\\nThis crowdfund is being conducted as part of a [Friends & Family Pre-Seed](https://www.gofundme.com/f/land-back-indigitech) round; an additional 10-20ETH to be raised via Mirror.\\n\\nOur primary product, idioke, is nearing product-market-fit. While the others are following-suit, and have existing minimum-testable-products ready for deployment.\\n\\nMy current need is for advisors.\\n\\nAnd that is **the primary aim of this crowdfund, to gain the oversight of those more informed on the business, technology, legal and financial ramifications of web3,** than I.\\n\\nMirror contributors therefore receive the largest percentage, and the first access to voting, vetting and verifying the DFLDAO’s external behavior.\\n\\nOwnership, as a whole, will consist of three primary groups, myself, monthly ([Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CultureClap) & [Ghost](https://www.cultureclap.com)) & GFM supporters, and Mirror contributors.\\n\\n* 90% Culture Clap / DreamFreely LLC\\n* 3% Monthly & GFM Contributors\\n* 7% Mirror Contributors\\n\\nTo the world, DreamFreely, an LLC based in the USA, will own the entirety of the operation for legal and tax purposes. Digitally seven-percent of the governance tokens will be distributed to Mirror contributors. Another three-percent, will be held in waiting for monthly supporters to claim.\\n\\nGovernance token distribution will also correlate to dividend distribution as well. Monthly & GoFundMe contributors are capped at 500. DreamFreely will receive  the bulk of the initial revenues as we measure and improve operating costs.\\n\\nThankfully we are starting with products that are generating revenue from day 1; and so we aim to never operate at a loss. Nor is our objective to hoard revenues, but rather to optimize our revenue by reinvesting it to create as much positive opportunity for others as possible. Concurrent to this, to create educational material others can use to do the same.\\n\\nNow the immediate goal is to grow our personal community, and to focus on the following few initial moving parts.\\n\\n1. Organizing Community Dialogue and Voting\\n2. Formalizing Benefit Tiers & Tokenomics\\n3. Verifying Primary Products & Payment Portals\\n\\n## About the NFT Passes\\n\\nThree tiers exist, the ***$ Pass***, the ***x0 Pass*** and the ***@ Pass***; each enables different levels of digital access, while together forming the Council of Thirty. Each level being the next in the line for vetting ideas, efforts and positions.\\n\\n**Additional benefits include:**\\n\\n* Private Discord\\n* Exclusive Airdrops\\n* Community Cosmonauts\\n\\nCommunity Cosmonauts will be among the first to travel beyond the digital benefits, to explore those available in the tactile world.\\n\\n### Council of Thirty (Co3)\\n\\nThe Co3 if composed of the Pass holders, and primarily provide ***web3, business, legal and tax council***. \\n\\nWe realize that not all information can be given directly, or freely. The DFLDAO seeks a base of experts through whom we can find what we may need at any given moment.\\n\\nWe are navigating new terrain, and we want to explore, while fortifying our position as efficiently as possible along the way. Those of us nearer to web3 technologies are more informed on the possibilities; though I look to you all to help strengthen these weaknesses of mine.\\n\\n### Council of Twenty (Co2)\\n\\nThe Co2 represents monthly fiat supporters, and primarily provide ***interpersonal, branding, marketing, outreach & community council***. If the Council of Thirty are to drive the organizations needs, it is the Council of Twenty that helps to govern the organization’s wants.\\n\\n### Council of One-Hundred (Co1)\\n\\nThe Co3 & Co2 combine to create the Council of Fifty (Co5), whose duty is to gather the Council of 100 (Co1). The Co5 establishes benchmarks and milestones, which it is the executive leaders’ responsibility to achieve, in collaboration with the Co5.\\n\\nThe Co1 are our initial beta-testers for new products and features. Co1 participants are initially pulled from the monthly supporting community, and others connected via mailing list and social media.\\n\\nAnd this is the start of our Level 2 Minimum Viable Community. Level 1 being the team that has made these materials, products and efforts available\\n\\n## The Goal\\n\\nThe goal is to be able to eventually share 25% of gross revenues with investor/owners, while using the rest of the revenues for expenses and community investment. Eventually, each of the individual products (idioke, Rebel Coding, etc) will be spun off into their own DAOs, and the DFLDAO will merely hold a stake in each of them.\\n\\nAs for how that happens, it is unknown and for us to decide when we get there.\\n\\nIf you’re interested getting involved, [drop me a line over on Twitter @CultureClap](https://www.twitter.com/CultureClap).\\n\\nI’m still fixin’ up the Discord, but please feel free to join [\\\\~ you’ll be early](https://discord.gg/bwMRRbs).\\n\\nThere are still a few questions about these Mirror fundraisers to get answered, though I hope to get this wrapped up by the end of the year if possible :)\\n\\nWhatcha think?\\n\\n***Next up:*** *What will be done with all the extra money ?*\",\"timestamp\":1635826220,\"title\":\"Introducing DFLDAO\"},\"digest\":\"4UlskLZSVVmbIroIZe-eWeJ-0vU3coUfqsutpEp6qz4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x37EDCc3A545F148706086d61507fC27e98990E3e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9-p-1DFDtJoPxSFITq3zO3uHs2p897-eVvkzfGvRtrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2XL2ZkU6YRqfd4RZ4CAh9BF468lP2OopmUKuz7ZsWf4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"i35IB5GDjdDNRjWLm5QfNVICYSsE7Hj2_pZf9_mEQNF4wE6POPwYfzCraASdHab4RatE1gyFYEyVJCs2wpH3ow\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xbea48e6f967aa7f6e31ef6b42dea2a078c9b9488d727e90b91343c4c0f398c9b0eb2c1acaffda08430e430e2673504d1b78142727b922c205b0e380e83642e1d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"9-p-1DFDtJoPxSFITq3zO3uHs2p897-eVvkzfGvRtrk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2XL2ZkU6YRqfd4RZ4CAh9BF468lP2OopmUKuz7ZsWf4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CMabCrgBd76SHBbdPbai_wl7F7JTQXMNuJEI5hFrIYk\"}"
