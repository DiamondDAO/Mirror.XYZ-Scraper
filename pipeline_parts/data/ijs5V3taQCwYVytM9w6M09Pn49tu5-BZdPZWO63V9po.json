"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Hi readers! First of all, let me introduce briefly about what this article series is so we can go right to building some understanding afterwards. In short, what I would like to accomplish is to help build some understanding, from the ground up, that will help us build some mental models for cryptography, web3, and blockchain. I choose this approach to because going **bottom-up** and building the *mental model* step-by-step might work better than starting with what it does, which some people call a **top-down** model of **understanding**.\\n\\n![We need these, a lot of these](https://images.pexels.com/photos/1148496/pexels-photo-1148496.jpeg)\\n\\nThis article is not where you will find some deep dive on the concepts and technicalities that enables cryptocurrency and web3. This is aimed to the general public that may feel that these things are so out there that you might as well tell them it’s magic (I mean to be honest these things are kind of magic).\\n\\n## Why did cryptocurrency get made?\\n\\nLet’s start with some general motivation as to why people created cryptocurrency which is the basis of web3 to begin with.\\n\\nWhy did we create this cryptocurrency? The first cryptocurrency is called Bitcoin, and Satoshi Nakamoto argued that\\n\\n> *e-commerce* *has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments* \\n\\nin his white paper [here](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf). This has bred its own set of problems as we are taking on the challenge of doing things **digitally** but with a trust model that is relying on things to happen **physically**. \\n\\nWhen things are happening in two different realms of existence, we can call this being not *native* to each other. This concept will appear numerous times as we work our understanding upwards.\\n\\nThis means that we put a really big part of this economy to the financial institutions who will help us mediate the transaction between two parties. So not only we have to trust these mediator institutions, we have to pay them a hefty fee to enable this transaction to happen. In a sense, we can say that this creates a one point of failure for our current system of e-commerce.\\n\\nAnother issue that was not written in the paper but was looming largely in its historical background, is the 2008 financial crisis that happened because these institutions created a large artificial market that was very risky but very profitable. When it collapsed, the community at large brunt the burden when it didn’t profit from the system to begin with. \\n\\nWe trust our government and the institutions inside to execute the monetary policy to the best to their ability, but as humans do they fail from time-to-time. Sometimes spectacularly, sometimes mildly. For a comprehensive report about the case for bitcoin on this issue combined with bitcoin’s electricity usage, NY Dig has published their findings [here](https://assets-global.website-files.com/614e11536f66309636c98688/616dbaa0e7aa2af652d58983_NYDIG-BitcoinNetZero_SML.pdf) if you want to read more. \\n\\n## How can we make a better transaction and monetary system?\\n\\nSo how do we start to solve the transaction problem? Satoshi expressed the solution as a sentence that many mathematicians and computer scientists have tried to do, with various success. He argued that “*what is needed is an electronic payment system based on **cryptographic proof** instead of **trust**, allowing any two willing parties to transact directly with each other without the need for a **trusted third party***“.\\n\\nCryptography has been the basis of internet security since its infancy. It evolved along with the Internet and provided the basis for [Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) and [Digital Signature.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature) The basic idea is this, a message is turned to gibberish and unreadable (*encrypted*) unless you can prove that you are who you say you are (*digital signature as identity*).\\n\\nAfter establishing that this is possible, we can create this transaction system to be similar to a ledger (book of transactions) where all participants have one copy, and all transactions are equipped with digital signature so only signed transactions are included and sent over the network. All ledgers need to contain the same transactions and no one can spend what they don’t have (balance cannot go to minus). Up until this point, it’s a pretty good system except for an issue of trust whose ledger is official. In computer science, this is known as a **Byzantine Generals Problem**.\\n\\n![Our ledger system so far](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ROLhvQtut6m35T6E_cujK.jpg?height=960&width=1880)\\n\\nUp until this point, not diving into technical details are doable. But I am afraid describing **Proof of Work** (which is how we are going to solve the *Byzantine Generals Problem*), are rather hard without doing so. I made a short presentation about it [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AuR6rACW7yNjpgEkV4bdoj-O7rjx), so please take a look if you’re interested.\\n\\nAs we are not going to dive in to *Proof of Work*, you’ll have to accept some assumptions that I will present here. The big idea is to accept **ledgers with the most work into it**. What does that mean? That means we have to pose a problem, and due to the problem requiring intensive *capital* to solve, that we can assume **whoever solved the problem have incentive to do good to the network by being trustworthy actors**.\\n\\nWhy would this assumption generally hold true? Because after allocating capital into a system, you would generally want the system to thrive and prosper in order for your capital to grow. We know that some people just want to see the world burn, no matter the cost, but the Bitcoin Whitepaper actually give some proof that to do so to the network you would have to amass an unlikely amount of capital (in this case 51% of the network’s processing power).\\n\\nIf you are still with me so far, we only have one problem left to describe this mental model: \\n\\n> How do we exactly *verify* which ledger has the most work put into it? \\n\\nBy the power of cryptography and the problem set posed by Proof of Work, this is easily done. Because of how cryptographic hash function works, we can safely assume that whoever​ possesses the *solution* must have gone through so much *work* to have it.​ In other words, **anyone can verify that they did a large amount of work without having to go through the same effort**.\\n\\nAs the incentive for both *validators* and *workers* (usually called *miners*), when the workers have done the work required, they are able to include a new block of transaction into the ledger and with it they receive a newly created (we call it *minted*) **asset** native to the system. This is the *cryptocurrency* of that system.\\n\\nIn summary, we now have the following properties in our proposed currency system:\\n\\n* Decentralized ledger system that is broadcasted over the Internet\\n* Identity are enforced via digital signature, transactions have to be signed by owner\\n* No overspend\\n* Trusted consensus protocol (this example via Proof of Work)\\n* Participants of the network who did the required work can be rewarded with the native asset of the system (this is how the currency is minted)\\n\\nWe are finally done with the big picture of features that we get in cryptocurrency. All of the attributes​ above generally describe any cryptocurrency network with Proof of Work. With these, we are finally able to get a transaction system with cryptographic proof which is purely *peer-to-peer*. This means that **trust is built-in on the transaction network** and this is huge.\\n\\nHowever this doesn’t solve any of the **monetary issue** with fiat money. Again, we’ll not cover the issues here as there are many essays already written about this \\\\[example\\\\]. So in this article, we’ll just say the properties that is proposed by Bitcoin to solve this. Bitcoin code creates a **limit of 21 million that will ever be created**, with new bitcoin coming **every around 10 minutes**. The more people participate to try to solve the puzzle posed in Proof of Work (*miners*) the more powerful the [network puzzle solving power](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate) is. So the bitcoin code has a way to make the puzzles harder, and vice versa when the mining power of the network goes down.\\n\\nThis means by design, bitcoin is going to be deflationary as we get closer to the limit. So far around 18.8 million bitcoin has been mined by Nov 2021 and circulates in the network as shown in [here](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/total-bitcoins). Let’s stop here and admire how cool is that we know exactly how many bitcoins there are circulating in the network, how powerful the network hash rate is, and many other metrics just because it’s all available openly. This enables a more accurate analysis of the underlying asset than ever before.\\n\\n## What about blockchain?\\n\\nYou might be surprised, but blockchain is the ledger system we described above. Each set of transactions are what we call *blocks* and they are linked to the next one just like a *chain*, hence the name. For many more technical details, you can go to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) as one starting point. The difference with other ledgers you have encountered in the traditional sense is that it has:\\n\\n* **Time stamp**, so we know how to order them.\\n* **Append-only**, so nothing ever gets deleted, and newer ones come in at the end, connecting with the previous block.\\n\\n## What about other cryptocurrencies?\\n\\nIn the grand scheme of things, the blockchain system described above works the same way in other cryptocurrencies, of course devil is in the details but it should suffice for our current mental model. The difference usually lies in the consensus model. While **Bitcoin** uses one Proof of Work model, current **Ethereum** uses another Proof of Work model with different numbers on the monetary side as well. Other cryptocurrencies such as **Algo** uses another consensus model called Proof of Stake with **Solana** adding another called Proof of History on top of the Proof of Stake. One research paper for many consensus protocols can be found [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/8/1363/pdf).\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nThese are the mental models we have acquired so far:\\n\\n* **Blockchain** is a ledger that is public and decentralized, used to denote transaction of its native assets, complete with information such volume and history.\\n* Blockchain combined with **consensus protocol** enables us to have a method of doing a direct (peer to peer) transaction safely to transfer value without the need of a third party.\\n* **Cryptocurrency** is the *reward* given to the validators for doing validations on proposed transactions using the consensus protocol. This is highly programmable and is different from one cryptocurrency to the next.\\n* **Cryptocurrency** is simply the native asset that is transacted on a blockchain that has the consensus protocol. So as an example, Bitcoin system has BTC, Ethereum has ETH, and Solana has SOL.\\n* **Trust** is built-in inside a cryptocurrency blockchain due to the consensus protocol.\\n\\n## Where do we go from here?\\n\\nNow that we equip ourselves with at least basic understanding about *blockchain* and *cryptocurrency*, we can build up on the next mental model: *blockchain computing*. How is that possible? We’ll try to cover it on the [next article of the series](https://mirror.xyz/guerakun.eth/W60l8R_SOmvMcYFhldOLoMcK-Acdc5LZ-ZkEk2xzKis). I’ll see you there!\\n\\nIf you are itching to know more and dive deep on Blockchains and Crypto, the awesome folks on a16z has actually compiled a *Crypto Canon* [here](https://a16z.com/2018/02/10/crypto-readings-resources/) with lots of hours worth of reading and tutorial.\",\"timestamp\":1638391710,\"title\":\"Understanding Crypto From Zero - Introduction\"},\"digest\":\"4WOyCkoCExDclkcvTHcKpf1sNCs8JI0qRdcHjvatsz8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8814f604604e735F80F547473991Ced756D29697\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NU0Ya51SwNItVCrYvkY92IFQnrXkpZ66MxFguMHxTO0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"z1ZXCgWiqatxQdlxryWm0Yw0rKU56F-g54c7bV7KmQ0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"q9WnRGUfzvDKJxJyw3hz7eESoBLeO8D4jv-cbSib6BmVRbTJaGQa1QR-Zp3CRFR7mmOgWEeA85M2TnwexNjL3g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x107a36b15c021135dc03af621a8131a25b21a77e4f6d798e339a9578942c887d021b5d0915e7f657920d60b4315764c40b32d9d603b8457e58db6285966b47161b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NU0Ya51SwNItVCrYvkY92IFQnrXkpZ66MxFguMHxTO0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"z1ZXCgWiqatxQdlxryWm0Yw0rKU56F-g54c7bV7KmQ0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pZT9BDTS7jo1p_e6WFRbDcZ5rv3uxwGYn2EWWCNYYxo\"}"
