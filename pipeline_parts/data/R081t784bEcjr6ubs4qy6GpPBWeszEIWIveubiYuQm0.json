"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Welcome to the 79th edition of Start-up Society!** This blog highlights some of the most exciting start-ups in the country striving to keep the American Dream alive.\\n\\nMake sure you check out the previous issue, if you have not already, *[here](https://medium.com/start-up-society/start-up-society-78-toba-capital-a89ddf4499ce).*\\n\\n![SOURCE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vQA53lNGF4g2WT_5xhsOF.png?height=675&width=1200)\\n\\n## In Summary…\\n\\nNon [Fungible](https://www.businessinsider.com/fungible-meaning) Tokens (NFTs) & Cryptocurrencies have frequently been in the news cycle for the past 18 months, with many people hearing about it for the first time. In this edition of Start-up Society, we will give a brief over view of NFTs and highlight two recently founded companies that have recently raised funding to help build out the space.\\n\\n## What is a Non Fungible Token?\\n\\n[NFTs](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Xdkkux6OxfM) represent ownership and allows for objects and concepts to be digitized, specifically on a [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain). Non-Fungible refers to its uniqueness and the Token refers to the blockchain representation. NFTs were originally founded on Ethereum and have become most popular in artist communities, where the NFT represents the art on chain (assuming the art is stored on chain as well). There have been many popular NFT collections that have dramatically risen in market value such as Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and there are others such as Chrome Squiggles which launched with an absurdly high price.\\n\\n## “BlueChip” NFT Collections\\n\\nThe particularly famous and highly valuable NFTs are what we consider “BlueChip” NFT collections. Below are three examples of collections and platforms. These are three examples of multiple thousands of NFT collections/groups. Most of the projects that are launched fail due to abandonment, exploit, or lack of community and the assumption that all NFTs bought or sold will appreciate in value is false.\\n\\n* **[CryptoPunks](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks)**: The iconic, original collection of 10,000. Owning one of these is like owning a rare Rolex watch. They’re iconic and extremely expensive. Anyone who has a CryptoPunk as their Twitter profile will command attention. Price: $300,000+ (We know…)\\n* **[Art Blocks:](https://www.artblocks.io/)** Art Blocks is a platform that features limited edition digital art from well-known artists. They have three different collections, with the most prestigious being their “Curated” collection. Pretty much any “Curated” Art Block is investment-grade, but you can’t go wrong with their first one, the Chromie Squiggle. Price: $40,000.\\n* **[Bored Ape Yacht Club:](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/)**[ ](https://boredapeyachtclub.com/)This was the first project that took the CryptoPunk model a step further with a roadmap, membership community, and other perks. Still, very expensive. Price: an Ape is $150,000+, a Mutant Ape is $20,000+, an Ape Dog Companion is $10,000+.\\n\\nWe are visiting two companies in California that are not releasing their own NFTs, but rather providing products and services to support and advance the overall ecosystem.\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HHrwc6ISStU-NKZHRXEIO.png?height=400&width=400)\\n\\n# Danvas\\n\\n**HQ:** Los Angeles\\n\\n**Founded:** 2021\\n\\n**Total Employees:** 2 (on *[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/danvas-art/)*)\\n\\n## ABOUT THE COMPANY\\n\\n* The company is introducing the first premium, luxury digital art canvas.

NFT sales in 2021 are on track to reach nearly $13 billion. Numerous NFTs have been selling at [Christie’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christie%27s) and [Sotheby’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotheby's) many of them fetching anywhere from $7m to $69m!\\n* Focusing on this end of the NFT market allows Danvas to tap into highly wealthy art curators and organizations, who would be willing to pay top dollar for a display system as futuristic as their [Chromie Squiggle](https://opensea.io/collection/chromie-squiggle-by-snowfro?search\\\\[sortAscending\\\\]=false&search\\\\[sortBy\\\\]=LAST_SALE_PRICE).\\n\\n## GO DEEPER\\n\\n[Danvas Raises $7M in Seed Funding](https://www.finsmes.com/2021/12/danvas-raises-7m-in-seed-funding.html)\\n\\n[Please welcome Danvas, a startup bringing NFTs and digital art into the real world](https://lererhippeau.medium.com/please-welcome-danvas-a-startup-bringing-nfts-and-digital-art-into-the-real-world-53621556eb8a)\\n\\n[Sotheby’s to sell ‘first’ NFT in online auction](https://www.reuters.com/technology/sothebys-sell-first-nft-online-auction-2021-06-01/)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mWpGdWABGmSN-LccSoQfc.png?height=630&width=1200)\\n\\n## Mnemonic\\n\\n**HQ:** San Francisco\\n\\n**Founded:** 2021\\n\\n**Total Employees:** 5 (on *[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mnemonichq/)*)\\n\\n## ABOUT THE COMPANY\\n\\n* Mnemonic is the first B2B (business-to-business) NFT company and its hope is to solve several problems within the NFT landscape, in particular making it easier for companies to track the NFT market and build their own using API (application programming interface).\\n* Mnemonic is focused on indexing on-chain data in order to allow the NFT artists to focus on their end product, building the data infrastructure layer for the next era of NFT companies.\\n* The goal does not stop there, however as the potential future use for Mnemonic could be for luxury good authentication. Huge brands will be able to use Mnemonic’s data tracking ability to know where their goods are going, who owns them and the NFT can serve as authentication of ownership.\\n\\n> *“There is so much demand and interest. We believe to provide and build more data visibility, actionability and accessibility to this data, as the rate that this data is producing is increasing every single day, is crucial.” — Andrii Yasinetsky, CEO and Co-Counder at Mnemonic*\\n\\n* The company raised $4 million in seed funding led by Kenetic and was joined by investors including Monochrome Capital, Sound Ventures, and Tribe Capital.\\n\\n## MEET THE TEAM\\n\\n**[Andrii Yasinetsky,](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasinetsky/) Co-Founder & CEO**\\n\\n* Prior to finding Mnemonic, Andrii received his Master’s Degree in Computer Science from the National Technical University of Ukraine ‘Kyiv Polytechnic Institute’ in 2008, before attending Harvard Business School in 2017.\\n* Yasinetsky would go on to be the founding engineer of JeraSoft and then Audiko before joining Google as a software application engineer in 2011 until 2015.
