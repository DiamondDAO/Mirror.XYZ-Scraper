Writers and poets — don’t miss this one!\\n\\n### Experiment and play with refined AI technology\\n\\nDevelopers of ART AI have been developing their technology over the last two years, providing a very elegant technology that outputs beautiful works as a text-to-art generator. It is the ultimate playground for writers to play with words in a new way!\\n\\n### See your words come to life\\n\\nNot only is Eponym Gen 2 a more refined generator than Gen 1, but it also allows you to add more characteristics in order to achieve a more customized and specific look. This gives you the chance to play with many kinds of combinations to discover new and inspiring pieces.\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/anyhagarcia/status/1455747986776944641?s=20](https://twitter.com/anyhagarcia/status/1455747986776944641?s=20)\\n\\n### Create an entire poem or story through Epostories\\n\\nAfter the initial Gen 2 burn, holders will be able to make optional alterations to their pieces called ‘Epovent’. These changes ultimately become Epostories where you can choose to continue to add layers onto the original piece thus offering a chance to make an entire poem or story.\\n\\n### We need more writers in the Epoverse\\n\\nI believe writers and poets have the skills to take full advantage of this technology to not only create stunning pieces of work but possibly capable of having the most joy in seeing their words come alive!\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Soul_Eater_43/status/1455665650899238917?s=20](https://twitter.com/Soul_Eater_43/status/1455665650899238917?s=20)\\n\\n**How it works:**\\n\\nYou must burn two Gen 1’s in order to mint a Gen 2 Eponym. Additionally, in order to modify your Gen 2 during the Epovent, you will also need a Gen 1 or a pen (more details arriving soon on pens). \\n\\nThe entire minting event lasts for a week, providing you with plenty of time to experiment and mint at a convenient time that works for you. \\n\\nAll in all, this gives you plenty of space to create your very own beautiful and stunning 1/1 masterpiece!\\n\\n[Check out Eponym’s blog to learn more.](https://medium.com/@EponymNFT/eponym-generation-2-beyond-5d249ac75672)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n*This micro-essay is 011 of #ship30for30 challenge.*\",\"timestamp\":1636136967,\"title\":\"Why writers & poets should mint Eponym Gen 2\",\"publication\":\"osirene\"},\"digest\":\"c_bItA4wiywfXLedi4_5Y6_tFlHlD0v70TIaQW15Nrc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x25E0FBc652CfC890d308961b7D34c08d109A491B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PxTmMyNc_Znx7wCuTYXqJZr1lit3W3eejNHdhmH4IXI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xav-grgP04q9Od96RcyNyViwKRVME-D5os0DcRoYLr4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Z19eAQIL_N8obwprmzrvqA7Wl2ecDUxL8xvLWoeoUIrkObRynfGbODyB0oDPYoWfctZ9a4YfjGakh8aadg6c9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x07184b3596deba292b0fc229203879fb7f93d226a8a508604ee3290246cee9772f42f90115da212f3d591b95e22610be06c6b8abbf2d4ef91dd4d3a6040555791b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on osirene.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"PxTmMyNc_Znx7wCuTYXqJZr1lit3W3eejNHdhmH4IXI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xav-grgP04q9Od96RcyNyViwKRVME-D5os0DcRoYLr4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"c_bItA4wiywfXLedi4_5Y6_tFlHlD0v70TIaQW15Nrc\"}"
