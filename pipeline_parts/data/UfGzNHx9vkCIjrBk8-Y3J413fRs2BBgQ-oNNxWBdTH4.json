"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I backed the Songcamp art collective’s new [Elektra crowdfund](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc) on Mirror this morning. Pretty cool use of multiple crowdfunding and community-building mechanics, and the project itself is very stylish and narrative-heavy. Kind of like an ARG, kind of like a DAO, kind of something else?\\n\\nThe crowdfund used Mirror’s `Editions` feature to offer 3 different tiers of rewards, at 0.1 ETH, 0.3 ETH and 1 ETH. Per typical Mirror crowdfund, backers receive both a ticket-NFT and $ELEKTRA governance tokens proportional to their contribution. But this is also the first crowdfund using Mirror’s new `Podium` feature, which gives special NFTs to the top 3 bidders:\\n\\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2Fqhnljj0proxknat%2Fscreen%2520shot%25202021-07-13%2520at%252011-32-23%2520the%2520elektra%2520crowdfund%2520%2520mirror%2520.png)\\n\\nTicket-NFT itself is a cool Top Shot-style 3D hologram video:\\n\\n[![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2F5qrttsc6mp4ghkc%2Fscreen%2520shot%25202021-07-13%2520at%252013-21-26%2520breaking%2520down%2520the%2520songcamp%2520elektra%2520crowdfund%2520%2520jamiedubs.com%2520.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2Ff07eoceyqrj7wqt%2F9f9eeae0-bb41-4ac6-b1bf-db99ec1b9e54.mp4\\\")\\n\\nThen all NFT owners can immediately join a community Discord server by visiting a slick “Portal to Elektra” landing page:\\n\\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2Fwutqkm4i21ezfom%2Fscreen%2520shot%25202021-07-13%2520at%252011-32-36%2520elektra%2520.png)\\n\\nAfter authenticating your NFT ownership with their [Collab.land](https://collab.land/) bot, the story begins…\\n\\n![](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s%2Fht5y4p9j1c8j1a1%2Fscreen%2520shot%25202021-07-13%2520at%252011-32-57%2520entry-point-1826%2520-%2520discord%2520.png)\\n\\nSome more highlights from their crowdfund pitch:\\n\\n> On *Elektra*, **music is energy**. Music is the fuel, electricity, and light of the world.\\n>\\n> Centuries ago, *Elektra* had a thriving civilization with a deep rooted sense of value towards art. But soon, motives around greed and self-interest took over, and the music that powered this world was lost.\\n>\\n> Your mission is to travel to *Elektra*, and help us collectively revive, restore and reignite this once beautiful world back to health.\\n>\\n> ***Will you accept your mission?***\\n\\nThe team is significant:\\n\\n> The *Songcamp Elektra* project is made up of \\\\~42 artists, devs, project ops and strategists working together to bring this world to life. This crowdfund intends to raise the funds that will enable us to do just that.\\n\\nAnd props for disclosing how you plan to use the funds:\\n\\n> We will use 90% of the amount raised to put towards the *Elektra* project.\\n>\\n> These funds will go toward the core team of project managers, web developers, artists and strategists working directly on the project. Other costs include transaction fees on the Ethereum blockchain, web hosting and file storage. We intend to save a portion of these funds to act as the *seed money* in standing up the *ElektraDAO* once this initial phase of the project is complete (more on that below).\\n>\\n> The remaining 10% will go directly to the artists who created the *Portal Ticket* visuals.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1626207159,\"title\":\"Breaking down the Songcamp $ELEKTRA crowdfund\",\"publication\":\"jamiew\"},\"digest\":\"3Paby5G8hiO2n0_RFMDM3-ZCReuvH4I9HnZyQ0P3edw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD9C4475E2dd89a9a0aD0C1E9a1e1bb28Df7BA298\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kxvOI4Fms3PeyLd5UM8Hij8h1zptxCvSih7ZQZwygEU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"77z9RUGmnZmA02iWvKVunAmMmUOKF-b1853VL2HbRgg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"vTzyfbwc6NUG-_7pgzHPyol3Yq5LcQSx7yrrYaNx5U2CvyC_UB-EN_rDpVOZQsBH2uuItA7F5ulatqyUwq5ZOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9b17f739c40eae5a46de3a5b3139ef4084b36294305dcaab26b7b515e29d0f2147830854354a7066ef595ae74087af8116ece85a1bd3219b8ef6927d0a5f258b1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on jamiew.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kxvOI4Fms3PeyLd5UM8Hij8h1zptxCvSih7ZQZwygEU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"77z9RUGmnZmA02iWvKVunAmMmUOKF-b1853VL2HbRgg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WGnBjXFoZs-UWxDcrZ8_-d4uFIpnMZZVThx2aFDfrrE\"}"
