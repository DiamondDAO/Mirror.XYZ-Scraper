"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I’ve always loved music, and I’ve always loved all kinds of music. When I think of my music taste, I often say: “if it’s good music, I’ll probably like it.”\\n\\nBut, even with that being said, hip hop has been one journey I’ve steered extremely far off. I guess it was just never my thing… oh, and maybe also just cause of stereotypical messages I’d heard about the messaging in many hip hop songs.\\n\\nSo it’s fair to say that I knew absolutely nothing about Chance The Rapper. I’d heard of him in circles. I’d also been subjected to back and further bickering about “so and so is the best rapper.” I can recall hearing Chance’s name mentioned in each of these conversations.\\n\\nThis weekend I came to know him for the first time as I watched him speak on the show: *Same Room.* I was amazed, to say the least. \\n\\nThere I was watching this hip-hop artist speak honestly about his fears as well as about his relationship with God. I had never seen it before. \\n\\n \\n I was really drawn to the way he reasoned, as well as how he understood the Word, but more importantly, I was really drawn to how he stayed himself throughout the process. Someone in the YouTube comment section put it this way: “he didn’t try and sound all spiritual. He spoke like himself.”\\n\\nI chuckled a bit as he kept on using the word “shit” in his sentences a few times. The legalized part of my brain kept thinking “oohh, he said that in front of Pastor Stephanie Ike”. But it’s that realness that really stood out to me.\\n\\nWhen it comes to anything related to God, it often feels like there’s a long list of do’s and don’ts list that we first need to fulfill before we can “be about God.”\\n\\nWatching that conversation was so inspirational. It was a reminder to me that I never need to stand back and say “I first want to figure out my life,” or “get everything in order” before I’m willing to go all out about God.  \\n \\n\\nGod wants us. Every part of us. The short-tempered parts, the loving parts, the parts we want to hide, as well as the parts we’ll gladly flaunt. \\n\\nI know of so many times where I’ve gone on this rampage of wanting to be “good enough” or straight-up disqualifying myself cause I didn’t fulfill all societal standards of expectation. \\n\\nI too wanna be able to show up in all spaces as me - fully me. Whether I’m around people who know God or people who don’t know God. \",\"timestamp\":1637439161,\"title\":\"Discovering Chance, the Rapper | A reminder to stay true to you\"},\"digest\":\"ll_Qb_EfNitMn0UNcv4P9Hvs9GNB9Awx8TXGsXF-dNU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9946213d6ea191df77F9e6F68665261Fc40750B0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wUgHSrfy_xp-H-eiL8RtwnErO4I7AHG46ihmJViB_qw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"c0uOs49L5PRBSaWirHLQKCK_x1NDfeaB9Y2Tqucvqyo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KU0QUI_BssMxHpQOq9Yviv84Epa-Lz1WHYyIx_kxqeDGgmgSleBSVqIW8QyMcIq8Lf9X0N3gD5-ffL97oR7q0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb8717640bf7918257e094edd21dad6ab0d5c6f1c88fa29af3b90e03b74be08085d044937d190eab90d31ca5605789aee9c5e446b754c75e9ce7f18979b54b6fa1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"wUgHSrfy_xp-H-eiL8RtwnErO4I7AHG46ihmJViB_qw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"c0uOs49L5PRBSaWirHLQKCK_x1NDfeaB9Y2Tqucvqyo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ll_Qb_EfNitMn0UNcv4P9Hvs9GNB9Awx8TXGsXF-dNU\"}"
