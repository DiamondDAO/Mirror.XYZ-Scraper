"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> Based on Kerr Avon from Blake’s 7.\\n\\nHe is a merchant at heart, neither loyal nor honest, but with a strong code of warped ethics. He will always offer a helping hand (puts people on your debt) and treasure his friends (treasures equals assets). He will be more than good, he will be the best, as long as it benefits him.\\n\\nIn his youth he worked as an intermediary between farmers and city merchants. After a few years of hard honest work, it all started to feel insufficient. The ROI was scant compared to the effort involved. Even worse, some colleagues were more adept, or more hardworking, and were raising in wealth and stature above him. Hence, he moved into the smuggling business. First smuggling food into besieged towns. Then as a fencer of illicit goods and fixer for wealthy patrons. He started to build a local reputation, which opened the doors for him to join an up and coming criminal guild. There he learned new skills and started to ascend the ranks. He found that he was particularly skilled in office politics. The art of ass kissing, palm greasing, backstabbing and humble/umbrage faking. Yago wished he was Avon.\\n\\n![Avon thinking: \\\"I have a thousand ideas on how to screw you!](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/7hxinPU6v4NFiwAH-RP09.jpg?height=300&width=400)\\n\\nA few months back, a job went sideways and he found himself alone, the patsy on the receiving end of an angry client. He run away. To all effects closing shop, liquidating whatever assets were available, and leaving his debtors in the ditch.\\n\\nHe writes his reflections about philosophy and life in a little parchment/journal that he treasures and hides from others. Some extracts:\\n\\n• “Life is a ledger. Every creature aims to increase its net worth. Even the most basic beast aims to feed (accumulation of assets), procreate (cost effective way to recruit minions) and be content (stand above the rest).”\\n\\n• “In a world of business, there is one rule that stands above all else: Me First. It is rooted in natural law and, besides, I owe it to myself.”\\n\\n• “Intangible assets can be more valuable than coin. A favor owed, a damaging secret, a fake friendship.”\\n\\n• “Writing off non performing assets (friends, colleagues) is both: the sensible thing to do, and you are making them a favor.”\\n\\n• “A liquidation event is just one way to get rid of liabilities.”\\n\\nIn his little journal there is also a list of assets and liabilities, with names, dates, descriptions and amounts. A treasure trove.\\n\\nHe is conniving, duplicitous and revengeful. Yet, he doesn’t look threatening at all. He doesn’t smile much and when he does, it is terribly awkward in a sneering kind of way, making people eerily uncomfortable (like something is out of place but cannot be pinpointed). But again, he is friendly and helpful… in a way.\",\"timestamp\":1633806030,\"title\":\"Avon\"},\"digest\":\"JNFjaMzisz45T_b4Iu6rJ0cf6Mr7O_y8SBivVinLerY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xaFE5F35D14ee9aBdaC14Bd2D0AF575CAbaf7D9e0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FeHak6WKZlTtdczVVLW9I6jOI6KUENIRZs8qqIs8qF4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Bw7_q2TmSSEzGB6t7Risc7-N3eoJ43grzkfY-iNe5AQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"K7Pgb_vhMO-5Zt8pdMMowCtokurh0BC7XqVPS7d3hoEj_931FZbMHVdc6DO2u0GmXH3q-xLjjBtrDSMvvSxD3w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xda955296a1bdaee9c85a6c8513aedf13422f91924c4102623e86d7d9127d24fd6d41536c6b055fe20ecc47c2ea4aa0e80a9c043519c19af6acf0a3c7564723ac1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FeHak6WKZlTtdczVVLW9I6jOI6KUENIRZs8qqIs8qF4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Bw7_q2TmSSEzGB6t7Risc7-N3eoJ43grzkfY-iNe5AQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"GFrvGER7DquAkPExfWUcERuD5JqPD9znp85-Yw40UEc\"}"
