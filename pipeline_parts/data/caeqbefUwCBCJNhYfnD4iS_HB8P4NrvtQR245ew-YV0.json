"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Back in 1998, I wrote a research paper for my degree on people’s attitudes towards a much-hyped new technological development: “The Internet”.\\n\\n![Web 1.0](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vu8XGAWEU0z_8db5AH6ve.jpeg?height=823&width=798)\\n\\nWe didn’t have internet at home (even dial-up), so it really did feel like something very new and exciting, and that the world truly was my oyster. I’d go to the computer room, open up Netscape, think of something to search for….and spend hours down a rabbit hole.  \\n  \\n I seem to recall spending a *lot* of time researching volunteering holidays I never actually went on…that, and chatting on MSN. While my housemates were making the most of £1 a pint at the Student’s Union (those were the days), I worked part-time for a student website, writing content and selling advertising. \\n\\nI hulked my massive Dell laptop around the streets of Cardiff, literally walking into shops and asking the owners if they’d like to advertise on the site. If they said yes, they’d pay me in cash up-front, I’d take the money back to our office at the back of a computer repair shop and write-up the ad. Simpler times….\\n\\nAnyway - I graduated at the height of the dot com boom in 2000, moved straight to London for my first job with a startup and the rest as they say, is history.  \\n  \\n That is to say - it all felt similar in many ways to current excitement about Web3 and the metaverse. Like my turtle-rescuing trips and ESL teaching plans, much of it may fail to materialise. \\n\\nBut for the projects and ideas that succeed?! Buckle up, it’s going to be one hell of a ride….\",\"timestamp\":1642723470,\"title\":\"Hello world?
