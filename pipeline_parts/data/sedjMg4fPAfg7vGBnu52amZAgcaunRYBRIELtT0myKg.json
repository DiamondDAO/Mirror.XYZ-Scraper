"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## “Is this my job?”\\n\\nThis piece is an introduction, a question, and a coagulation of big feelings that have sat with me for a loooong time.\\n\\n**Please watch before reading on:**\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk](https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk)\\n\\nI have/had many jobs. I think I’ll always have many “jobs” at once according to various interests, abilities, and context.\\n\\nCreating is a job I take very seriously - despite rarely getting paid for it.  However, the process of becoming a paid artist in the music platform/social media era has always felt a bit unnatural to me.\\n\\nI shared some thoughts with my friends/collaborators in the [songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/) community that I think are relevant here:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppuNlAxPV5vVclNxWohbg.png?height=1314&width=1354)\\n\\n*“Is this my job”* is me stepping forward to communicate feelings that have been in me and (I think) a lot of us as we begin to accept a reality where finding work that aligns with our personal strengths/passions may be the most logical, most valuable, and best compensated action one could take (both for ourselves and our communities). Use it if it helps.\\n\\n## I NEED A JOB (Music Visual)\\n\\nVarious parts of “Is this my Job” will be available to collect/compensate over the coming months. \\n\\n***First up is the “I NEED A JOB” music video.***\\n\\n[ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/5799](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/5799)\\n\\nI started creating I NEED A JOB in 2015 and finished it in September 2021.\\n\\nIt’s tried on a lot of different outfits from then to now but I think it’s finally found colors that suit it. I’m happy to feel this idea captured in a tangible way.\\n\\n***I am making it available as an auction with a reserve price of 8.8 ETH****.* \\n\\nThis is essentially a crowdfund to reach a “price” rather than a “goal.” \\n\\nI’ve started a PartyBid so that anyone can contribute whatever they want if they want. If the PartyBid wins, everyone who contributed will own a piece of the NFT. I hope that’s what happens. I want those who support me directly to own a piece of what they supported directly.\\n\\n[https://partybid.app/party/0xd674Ef8bD098b7C4F791d65cc7A679f3ac5855D0](https://partybid.app/party/0xd674Ef8bD098b7C4F791d65cc7A679f3ac5855D0)\\n\\n**If you feel something while consuming art - the art already belongs to you.** \\n\\nYou don’t need to contribute financially in order to make what I made yours. Knowing it made anyone feel is the greatest validation I could receive. So regardless of how/if you choose to compensate what I’ve made - I appreciate you spending the time to take it in. \\n\\nHit me on twitter if you wanna chat: \\n\\n[https://twitter.com/willsnotebooks](https://twitter.com/willsnotebooks)\\n\\n* Will :0)\\n\\n### \",\"timestamp\":1636401934,\"title\":\"I NEED A JOB.\",\"publication\":\"willjuergens\"},\"digest\":\"heqwKJVJCW-z-EeaaKbAU0CkAs_5hJHCWPF6hnLV3Dk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4786cDa66e176173568Ce26343135543A3F04cB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v-_ht87xRmkwiTGZi-M7g5nIfn7vsTU44gto_mCRaWM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1fN2A3cytNJzVqEun_1rLhEZL4V_jOO2JvueGx49g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Xdx3DP18XsI0M6KdIrUkVvo6UEFNjUN9bYALuMr87fgg73wc4NvWf9RudWO8CDbhEUulcphoBdXHZhPlsBPFrg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6993da8e2f231f82d715858a009680b3b03764fbe68711f7e09b95595be4e5e27cae3201c0e93b3efa20bff9bd9ed6bfce3589d50fd36b425731ed64f0779cd71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v-_ht87xRmkwiTGZi-M7g5nIfn7vsTU44gto_mCRaWM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1fN2A3cytNJzVqEun_1rLhEZL4V_jOO2JvueGx49g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Iop1K9RENJB7aBpHh_GecojhTLllnP8sAC2DEv-hrEk\"}"
