"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Utility. Is it needed for every project? We’re not sure if anyone has the answer for this one. But for this project, we have a few key utility features we would like to offer in partnership with the [Tech by Choice DAO](https://www.techbychoice.org/). \\n\\n* First-time holders will receive a physical mug\\n* First-time holders will receive a Mental Health Coloring Book Airdrop \\n* Impact Updates First-time holders\\n* Lifetime ticket to TBC’s Galas\\\\*\\n* Funding the Black Tax Fund\\n* Access to TBC community as a membership at a supporter level\\\\*\\n\\nWhile there are a number of NFT projects and groups turning into a DAO, we would like to remind people, we are supporting an existing organization to move to the blockchain. Since they already have a foundation and structure for supporting the community, we know they are a solid partner when it comes to caring for and nurturing the community we’re building. \\n\\nAs we get closer to our launch date, we will share all of the utilities and any new community updates. For now, we invite you to follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CommuniTeaNFT) and join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/H4rkwCBgTA) to find out how you can be added to our reservation list for our drop.\\n\\n*\\\\* Tech by Choice is a community that centers the marginalized experiences.
