But this was too apropos.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ATc74SF6DKZdOqZTbeUSO.png?height=111&width=1039)\\n\\nOne of the greatest gifts of the past year or so has been the amazing people I’ve met as a result of tumbling down the crypto and web3 rabbit hole.\\n\\nI ventured into the [Krause House](https://krausehouse.club/) [Discord](https://discord.gg/egMhTZZn) in June to experience a bit of the off-the-charts creative juju that I was hearing about via the crypto grapevine.\\n\\nWell, I found that incredible energy…but best of all, I also found [Flex Chapman](https://twitter.com/flexxchapman), co-founder of Krause House.\\n\\nI was so happy that Flex joined me last Friday on the vlog. He was super gracious with his time and our nearly one-hour jam session meandered through:\\n\\n▹ The importance of working a ritual of “pause and reflect” into one’s life. (Flex brought up a surprising analogy found in the world of software development!)\\n\\n▹ The best DAO onboarding experience I’ve had to date.\\n\\n▹ Flex’s re-discovery of the power of cohort-based activities.\\n\\n▹ Flex’s journey through the Seed Club accelerator (and how there may be no such thing as a blueprint or subject matter expert in crypto).\\n\\n▹ Why a broader conception of onboarding may be needed, embracing the entire DAO community and helping folks onramp to web3, DeFi, etc. (Krause House University, here we come!)\\n\\n▹ FWB pets, plants & home decor channels…folks have a million other places on the Web to talk about these things, but they **choose** to do so in the FWB Discord. What’s the secret sauce?\\n\\n▹ *Understand the user persona,* says Flex. There’s a wide array of people coming through a Discord with unique goals and interests. But…*We can’t solve for everyone, either.*\\n\\n▹ What does Flex think are the top psychological motivations that drive not just membership but deep commitment to a DAO? (h/t Scott Mandel.)\\n\\n▹ How do you protect the vitality and creative energy of an org while setting up forms/ structures to support its growth?\\n\\n▹ The most powerful paradox:  passionately believing everything is broken while simultaneously, deeply surrendering and trusting in the process.  *Ask,* Flex says, *what could go right?*\\n\\n▹  Take those 1:1 calls with your fellows in the DAO!  Voice > text. *Game-changing*, says Flex.\\n\\n▹  What’s the most powerful question you can ask on a 1:1?\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/B9xK6v-elkk](https://youtu.be/B9xK6v-elkk)\\n\\nsigning off, with gratitude to Flex,\\n\\nC\",\"timestamp\":1634108355,\"title\":\"Ep 6 | Looking back, looking forward\",\"publication\":\"tao-of-dao\"},\"digest\":\"8hHD_PkPEUyGvx1wjZ4-tej2tNaOazFdRm6H6ZmxOhs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xF737EBd5f22E661136737bb92218B398Fb0Ab584\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EVGSB-gC_-vtsZQ0MXY_1u8cX6QizN5EM5ZbnB3kOII\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zbYrwQbhIHC3vU4T2qnXVdlk2tvk7C2KftCt_C8rDWM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GPPwp6HdRz9_O3uWrpw98YomIbmdqGSOPSGW0JiT0d59_t-sPzFPMXAbRUhuXJTgN6bPQMixkixRUUKBMzIeJQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9a4e6c1832188ee7ad6b6d98ab9794c65aa927cc7a238e2f3c8d2875ea1394cf533934ebe00af453319adb2ef1767316a1d3c52b6132d6baa50d57bbf588a6b91b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on tao-of-dao.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EVGSB-gC_-vtsZQ0MXY_1u8cX6QizN5EM5ZbnB3kOII\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zbYrwQbhIHC3vU4T2qnXVdlk2tvk7C2KftCt_C8rDWM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"StvjGvsivALDUCt2S_Eax7QsBahhNFPzErVLuOymo1c\"}"
