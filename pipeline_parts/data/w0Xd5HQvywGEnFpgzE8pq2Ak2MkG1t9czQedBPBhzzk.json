"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In view of the future, it was advisable to keep himself in hiding from the authorities, particularly the Romans. Malluch was shrewd and trusty; the very man to charge with the conduct of the investigation.\\n\\nWhere to begin was the first point. He had no clear idea about it. His wish was to commence with the Tower of Antonia. Tradition not of long standing planted the gloomy pile over a labyrinth of prison-cells, which, more even than the strong garrison, kept it a terror to the Jewish fancy. A burial, such as his people had been subjected to, might be possible there. Besides, in such a strait, the natural inclination is to start search at the place where the loss occurred, and he could not forget that his last sight of the loved ones was as the guard pushed them along the street in the direction to the Tower. If they were not there now, but had been, some record of the fact must remain, a clew which had only to be followed faithfully to the end.\\n\\nUnder this inclination, moreover, there was a hope which he could not forego. From Simonides he knew Amrah, the Egyptian nurse, was living. It will be remembered, doubtless, that the faithful creature, the morning the calamity overtook the Hurs, broke from the guard and ran back into the palace, where, along with other chattels, she had been sealed up. During the years following, Simonides kept her supplied; so she was there now, sole occupant of the great house, which, with all his offers, Gratus had not been able to sell. The story of its rightful owners sufficed to secure the property from strangers, whether purchasers or mere occupants. People going to and fro passed it with whispers. Its reputation was that of a haunted house; derived probably from the infrequent glimpses of poor old Amrah, sometimes on the roof, sometimes in a latticed window. Certainly no more constant spirit ever abided than she; nor was there ever a tenement so shunned and fitted for ghostly habitation. Now, if he could get to her, Ben-Hur fancied she could help him to knowledge which, though faint, might yet be serviceable. Anyhow, sight of her in that place, so endeared by recollection, would be to him a pleasure next to finding the objects of his solicitude.\\n\\nSo, first of all things, he would go to the old house, and look for Amrah.\\n\\nThus resolved, he arose shortly after the going-down of the sun, and began descent of the Mount by the road which, from the summit, bends a little north of east. Down nearly at the foot, close by the bed of the Cedron, he came to the intersection with the road leading south to the village of Siloam and the pool of that name. There he fell in with a herdsman driving some sheep to market. He spoke to the man, and joined him, and in his company passed by Gethsemane on into the city through the Fish Gate.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nIt was dark when, parting with the drover inside the gate, Ben-Hur turned into a narrow lane leading to the south. A few of the people whom he met saluted him. The bouldering of the pavement was rough. The houses on both sides were low, dark, and cheerless; the doors all closed: from the roofs, occasionally, he heard women crooning to children. The loneliness of his situation, the night, the uncertainty cloaking the object of his coming, all affected him cheerlessly. With feelings sinking lower and lower, he came directly to the deep reservoir now known as the Pool of Bethesda, in which the water reflected the over-pending sky. Looking up, he beheld the northern wall of the Tower of Antonia, a black frowning heap reared into the dim steel-gray sky. He halted as if challenged by a threatening sentinel.\\n\\nThe Tower stood up so high, and seemed so vast, resting apparently upon foundations so sure, that he was constrained to acknowledge its strength. If his mother were there in living burial, what could he do for her? By the strong hand, nothing. An army might beat the stony face with ballista and ram, and be laughed at. Against him alone, the gigantic southeast turret looked down in the self-containment of a hill. And he thought, cunning is so easily baffled; and God, always the last resort of the helpless--God is sometimes so slow to act!\\n\\nIn doubt and misgiving, he turned into the street in front of the Tower, and followed it slowly on to the west.\\n\\nOver in Bezetha he knew there was a khan, where it was his intention to seek lodging while in the city; but just now he could not resist the impulse to go home. His heart drew him that way.\\n\\nThe old formal salutation which he received from the few people who passed him had never sounded so pleasantly. Presently, all the eastern sky began to silver and shine, and objects before invisible in the west--chiefly the tall towers on Mount Zion--emerged as from a shadowy depth, and put on spectral distinctness, floating, as it were, above the yawning blackness of the valley below, very castles in the air.\\n\\nHe came, at length, to his father's house.\\n\\nOf those who read this page, some there will be to divine his feelings without prompting. They are such as had happy homes in their youth, no matter how far that may have been back in time--homes which are now the starting-points of all recollection; paradises from which they went forth in tears, and which they would now return to, if they could, as little children; places of laughter and singing, and associations dearer than any or all the triumphs of after-life.\\n\\nAt the gate on the north side of the old house Ben-Hur stopped. In the corners the wax used in the sealing-up was still plainly seen, and across the valves was the board with the inscription--\\n\\n\\\"THIS IS THE PROPERTY OF      THE EMPEROR.\\\"\\n\\nNobody had gone in or out the gate since the dreadful day of the separation. Should he knock as of old? It was useless, he knew; yet he could not resist the temptation. Amrah might hear, and look out of one of the windows on that side. Taking a stone, he mounted the broad stone step, and tapped three times. A dull echo replied. He tried again, louder than before; and again, pausing each time to listen. The silence was mocking. Retiring into the street, he watched the windows; but they, too, were lifeless. The parapet on the roof was defined sharply against the brightening sky; nothing could have stirred upon it unseen by him, and nothing did stir.\\n\\nFrom the north side he passed to the west, where there were four windows which he watched long and anxiously, but with as little effect. At times his heart swelled with impotent wishes; at others, he trembled at the deceptions of his own fancy. Amrah made no sign--not even a ghost stirred.\\n\\nSilently, then, he stole round to the south. There, too, the gate was sealed and inscribed. The mellow splendor of the August moon, pouring over the crest of Olivet, since termed the Mount of Offence, brought the lettering boldly out; and he read, and was filled with rage. All he could do was to wrench the board from its nailing, and hurl it into the ditch. Then he sat upon the step, and prayed for the New King, and that his coming might be hastened. As his blood cooled, insensibly he yielded to the fatigue of long travel in the summer heat, and sank down lower, and, at last, slept.\\n\\nAbout that time two women came down the street from the direction of the Tower of Antonia, approaching the palace of the Hurs. They advanced stealthily, with timid steps, pausing often to listen. At the corner of the rugged pile, one said to the other, in a low voice,\\n\\n\\\"This is it, Tirzah!\\\"\\n\\nAnd Tirzah, after a look, caught her mother's hand, and leaned upon her heavily, sobbing, but silent.\\n\\n\\\"Let us go on, my child, because\\\"--the mother hesitated and trembled; then, with an effort to be calm, continued--\\\"because when morning comes they will put us out of the gate of the city to--return no more.\\\"\\n\\nTirzah sank almost to the stones.\\n\\n\\\"Ah, yes!\\\" she said, between sobs; \\\"I forgot. I had the feeling of going home. But we are lepers, and have no homes; we belong to the dead!\\\"\\n\\nThe mother stooped and raised her tenderly, saying, \\\"We have nothing to fear. Let us go on.\\\"\\n\\nIndeed, lifting their empty hands, they could have run upon a legion and put it to flight.\\n\\nAnd, creeping in close to the rough wall, they glided on, like two ghosts, till they came to the gate, before which they also paused. Seeing the board, they stepped upon the stone in the scarce cold tracks of Ben-Hur, and read the inscription--\\\"This is the Property of the Emperor.\\\"\\n\\nThen the mother clasped her hands, and, with upraised eyes, moaned in unutterable anguish.\\n\\n\\\"What now, mother? You scare me!\\\"\\n\\nAnd the answer was, presently, \\\"Oh, Tirzah, the poor are dead! He is dead!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who, mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your brother! They took everything from him--everything--even this house!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor!\\\" said Tirzah, vacantly.\\n\\n\\\"He will never be able to help us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then, mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To-morrow--to-morrow, my child, we must find a seat by the wayside, and beg alms as the lepers do; beg, or--\\\"\\n\\nTirzah leaned upon her again, and said, whispering, \\\"Let us--let us die!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No!\\\" the mother said, firmly. \\\"The Lord has appointed our times, and we are believers in the Lord. We will wait on him even in this. Come away!\\\"\\n\\nShe caught Tirzah's hand as she spoke, and hastened to the west corner of the house, keeping close to the wall. No one being in sight there, they kept on to the next corner, and shrank from the moonlight, which lay exceedingly bright over the whole south front, and along a part of the street. The mother's will was strong. Casting one look back and up to the windows on the west side, she stepped out into the light, drawing Tirzah after her; and the extent of their amiction was then to be seen--on their lips and cheeks, in their bleared eyes, in their cracked hands; especially in the long, snaky locks, stiff with loathsome ichor, and, like their eyebrows, ghastly white. Nor was it possible to have told which was mother, which daughter; both alike seemed witch-like old.\\n\\n\\\"Hist!\\\" said the mother. \\\"There is some one lying upon the step--a man. Let us go round him.\\\"\\n\\nThey crossed to the opposite side of the street quickly, and, in the shade there, moved on till before the gate, where they stopped.\\n\\n\\\"He is asleep, Tirzah!\\\"\\n\\nThe man was very still.\\n\\n\\\"Stay here, and I will try the gate.\\\"\\n\\nSo saying, the mother stole noiselessly across, and ventured to touch the wicket; she never knew if it yielded, for that moment the man sighed, and, turning restlessly, shifted the handkerchief on his head in such manner that the face was left upturned and fair in the broad moonlight. She looked down at it and started; then looked again, stooping a little, and arose and clasped her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in mute appeal. An instant so, and she ran back to Tirzah.\\n\\n\\\"As the Lord liveth, the man is my son--thy brother!\\\" she said, in an awe-inspiring whisper.\\n\\n\\\"My brother?--Judah?\\\"\\n\\nThe mother caught her hand eagerly.\\n\\n\\\"Come!\\\" she said, in the same enforced whisper, \\\"let us look at him together--once more--only once--then help thou thy servants, Lord!\\\"\\n\\nThey crossed the street hand in hand ghostly-quick, ghostly-still. When their shadows fell upon him, they stopped. One of his hands was lying out upon the step palm up. Tirzah fell upon her knees, and would have kissed it; but the mother drew her back.\\n\\n\\\"Not for thy life; not for thy life! Unclean, unclean!\\\" she whispered.\\n\\nTirzah shrank from him, as if he were the leprous one.\\n\\nBen-Hur was handsome as the manly are. His cheeks and forehead were swarthy from exposure to the desert sun and air; yet under the light mustache the lips were red, and the teeth shone white, and the soft beard did not hide the full roundness of chin and throat. How beautiful he appeared to the mother's eyes! How mightily she yearned to put her arms about him, and take his head upon her bosom and kiss him, as had been her wont in his happy childhood! Where got she the strength to resist the impulse? From her love, O, reader!--her mother-love, which, if thou wilt observe well, hath this unlikeness to any other love: tender to the object, it can be infinitely tyrannical to itself, and thence all its power of self-sacrifice. Not for restoration to health and fortune, not for any blessing of life, not for life itself, would she have left her leprous kiss upon his cheek! Yet touch him she must; in that instant of finding him she must renounce him forever! How bitter, bitter hard it was, let some other mother say! She knelt down, and, crawling to his feet, touched the sole of one of his sandals with her lips, yellow though it was with the dust of the street--and touched it again and again; and her very soul was in the kisses.\\n\\nHe stirred, and tossed his hand. They moved back, but heard him mutter in his dream,\\n\\n\\\"Mother! Amrah! Where is--\\\"\\n\\nHe fell off into the deep sleep.\\n\\nTirzah stared wistfully. The mother put her face in the dust, struggling to suppress a sob so deep and strong it seemed her heart was bursting. Almost she wished he might waken.\\n\\nHe had asked for her; she was not forgotten; in his sleep he was thinking of her. Was it not enough?\\n\\nPresently mother beckoned to Tirzah, and they arose, and taking one more look, as if to print his image past fading, hand in hand they recrossed the street. Back in the shade of the wall there, they retired and knelt, looking at him, waiting for him to wake--waiting some revelation, they knew not what. Nobody has yet given us a measure for the patience of a love like theirs.\\n\\nBy-and-by, the sleep being yet upon him, another woman appeared at the corner of the palace. The two in the shade saw her plainly in the light; a small figure, much bent, dark-skinned, gray-haired, dressed neatly in servant's garb, and carrying a basket full of vegetables.\\n\\nAt sight of the man upon the step the new-comer stopped; then, as if decided, she walked on--very lightly as she drew near the sleeper. Passing round him, she went to the gate, slid the wicket latch easily to one side, and put her hand in the opening. One of the broad boards in the left valve swung ajar without noise. She put the basket through, and was about to follow, when, yielding to curiosity, she lingered to have one look at the stranger whose face was below her in open view.\\n\\nThe spectators across the street heard a low exclamation, and saw the woman rub her eyes as if to renew their power, bend closer down, clasp her hands, gaze wildly around, look at the sleeper, stoop and raise the outlying hand, and kiss it fondly--that which they wished so mightily to do, but dared not.\\n\\nAwakened by the action, Ben-Hur instinctively withdrew the hand; as he did so, his eyes met the woman's.\\n\\n\\\"Amrah! O Amrah, is it thou?\\\" he said.\\n\\nThe good heart made no answer in words, but fell upon his neck, crying for joy.\\n\\nGently he put her arms away, and lifting the dark face wet with tears, kissed it, his joy only a little less than hers. Then those across the way heard him say,\\n\\n\\\"Mother--Tirzah--O Amrah, tell me of them! Speak, speak, I pray thee!\\\"\\n\\nAmrah only cried afresh.\\n\\n\\\"Thou has seen them, Amrah. Thou knowest where they are; tell me they are at home.\\\"\\n\\nTirzah moved, but her mother, divining her purpose, caught her and whispered, \\\"Do not go--not for life. Unclean, unclean!\\\"\\n\\nHer love was in tyrannical mood. Though both their hearts broke, he should not become what they were; and she conquered.\\n\\nMeantime, Amrah, so entreated, only wept the more.\\n\\n\\\"Wert thou going in?\\\" he asked, presently, seeing the board swung back. \\\"Come, then. I will go with thee.\\\" He arose as he spoke. \\\"The Romans--be the curse of the Lord upon them!--the Romans lied. The house is mine. Rise, Amrah, and let us go in.\\\" A moment and they were gone, leaving the two in the shade to behold the gate staring blankly at them--the gate which they might not ever enter more. They nestled together in the dust.\\n\\nThey had done their duty.\\n\\nTheir love was proven.\\n\\nNext morning they were found, and driven out the city with stones.\\n\\n\\\"Begone! Ye are of the dead; go to the dead!\\\"\\n\\nWith the doom ringing in their ears, they went forth.\\n\\nCHAPTER V\\n\\nNowadays travellers in the Holy Land looking for the famous place with the beautiful name, the King's Garden, descend the bed of the Cedron or the curve of Gihon and Hinnom as far as the old well En-rogel, take a drink of the sweet living water, and stop, having reached the limit of the interesting in that direction. They look at the great stones with which the well is curbed, ask its depth, smile at the primitive mode of drawing the purling treasure, and waste some pity on the ragged wretch who presides over it; then, facing about, they are enraptured with the mounts Moriah and Zion, both of which slope towards them from the north, one terminating in Ophel, the other in what used to be the site of the city of David. In the background, up far in the sky, the garniture of the sacred places is visible: here the Haram, with its graceful dome; yonder the stalward remains of Hippicus, defiant even in ruins. When that view has been enjoyed, and is sufficiently impressed upon the memory, the travellers glance at the Mount of Offence standing in rugged stateliness at their right hand, and then at the Hill of Evil Counsel over on the left, in which, if they be well up in Scriptural history and in the traditions rabbinical and monkish, they will find a certain interest not to be overcome by superstitious horror.\\n\\nIt were long to tell all the points of interest grouped around that hill; for the present purpose, enough that its feet are planted in the veritable orthodox Hell of the moderns--the Hell of brimstone and fire--in the old nomenclature Gehenna; and that now, as in the days of Christ, its bluff face opposite the city on the south and southeast is seamed and pitted with tombs which have been immemorially the dwelling-places of lepers, not singly, but collectively. There they set up their government and established their society; there they founded a city and dwelt by themselves, avoided as the accursed of God.\\n\\nThe second morning after the incidents of the preceding chapter, Amrah drew near the well En-rogel, and seated herself upon a stone. One familiar with Jerusalem, looking at her, would have said she was the favorite servant of some well-to-do family. She brought with her a water-jar and a basket, the contents of the latter covered with a snow-white napkin. Placing them on the ground at her side, she loosened the shawl which fell from her head, knit her fingers together in her lap, and gazed demurely up to where the hill drops steeply down into Aceldama and the Potter's Field.\\n\\nIt was very early, and she was the first to arrive at the well. Soon, however, a man came bringing a rope and a leathern bucket. Saluting the little dark-faced woman, he undid the rope, fixed it to the bucket, and waited customers. Others who chose to do so might draw water for themselves, he was a professional in the business, and would fill the largest jar the stoutest woman could carry for a gerah.\\n\\nAmrah sat still, and had nothing to say. Seeing the jar, the man asked after a while if she wished it filled; she answered him civilly, \\\"Not now;\\\" whereupon he gave her no more attention. When the dawn was fairly defined over Olivet, his patrons began to arrive, and he had all he could do to attend to them. All the time she kept her seat, looking intently up at the hill.\\n\\nThe sun made its appearance, yet she sat watching and waiting; and while she thus waits, let us see what her purpose is.\\n\\nHer custom had been to go to market after nightfall. Stealing out unobserved, she would seek the shops in the Tyropoeon, or those over by the Fish Gate in the east, make her purchases of meat and vegetables, and return and shut herself up again.\\n\\nThe pleasure she derived from the presence of Ben-Hur in the old house once more may be imagined. She had nothing to tell him of her mistress or Tirzah--nothing. He would have had her move to a place not so lonesome; she refused. She would have had him take his own room again, which was just as he had left it; but the danger of discovery was too great, and he wished above all things to avoid inquiry. He would come and see her often as possible. Coming in the night, he would also go away in the night. She was compelled to be satisfied, and at once occupied herself contriving ways to make him happy. That he was a man now did not occur to her; nor did it enter her mind that he might have put by or lost his boyish tastes; to please him, she thought to go on her old round of services. He used to be fond of confections; she remembered the things in that line which delighted him most, and resolved to make them, and have a supply always ready when he came. Could anything be happier? So next night, earlier than usual, she stole out with her basket, and went over to the Fish Gate Market. Wandering about, seeking the best honey, she chanced to hear a man telling a story.\\n\\nWhat the story was the reader can arrive at with sufficient certainty when told that the narrator was one of the men who had held torches for the commandant of the Tower of Antonia when, down in cell VI., the Hurs were found. The particulars of the finding were all told, and she heard them, with the names of the prisoners, and the widow's account of herself.\\n\\nThe feelings with which Amrah listened to the recital were such as became the devoted creature she was. She made her purchases, and returned home in a dream. What a happiness she had in store for her boy! She had found his mother!\\n\\nShe put the basket away, now laughing, now crying. Suddenly she stopped and thought. It would kill him to be told that his mother and Tirzah were lepers. He would go through the awful city over on the Hill of Evil Counsel--into each infected tomb he would go without rest, asking for them, and the disease would catch him, and their fate would be his. She wrung her hands. What should she do?\\n\\nLike many a one before her, and many a one since, she derived inspiration, if not wisdom, from her affection, and came to a singular conclusion.\\n\\nThe lepers, she knew, were accustomed of mornings to come down from their sepulchral abodes in the hill, and take a supply of water for the day from the well En-rogel. Bringing their jars, they would set them on the ground and wait, standing afar until they were filled. To that the mistress and Tirzah must come; for the law was inexorable, and admitted no distinction. A rich leper was no better than a poor one.\\n\\nSo Amrah decided not to speak to Ben-Hur of the story she had heard, but go alone to the well and wait. Hunger and thirst would drive the unfortunates thither, and she believed she could recognize them at sight; if not, they might recognize her.\\n\\nMeantime Ben-Hur came, and they talked much. To-morrow Malluch would arrive; then the search should be immediately begun. He was impatient to be about it. To amuse himself he would visit the sacred places in the vicinity. The secret, we may be sure, weighed heavily on the woman, but she held her peace.\\n\\nWhen he was gone she busied herself in the preparation of things good to eat, applying her utmost skill to the work. At the approach of day, as signalled by the stars, she filled the basket, selected a jar, and took the road to En-rogel, going out by the Fish Gate which was earliest open, and arriving as we have seen.\\n\\nShortly after sunrise, when business at the well was most pressing, and the drawer of water most hurried; when, in fact, half a dozen buckets were in use at the same time, everybody making haste to get away before the cool of the morning melted into the heat of the day, the tenantry of the hill began to appear and move about the doors of their tombs. Somewhat later they were discernible in groups, of which not a few were children so young that they suggested the holiest relation. Numbers came momentarily around the turn of the bluff--women with jars upon their shoulders, old and very feeble men hobbling along on staffs and crutches. Some leaned upon the shoulders of others; a few--the utterly helpless--lay, like heaps of rags, upon litters. Even that community of superlative sorrow had its love-light to make life endurable and attractive. Distance softened without entirely veiling the misery of the outcasts.\\n\\nFrom her seat by the well Amrah kept watch upon the spectral groups. She scarcely moved. More than once she imagined she saw those she sought. That they were there upon the hill she had no doubt; that they must come down and near she knew; when the people at the well were all served they would come.\\n\\nNow, quite at the base of the bluff there was a tomb which had more than once attracted Amrah by its wide gaping. A stone of large dimensions stood near its mouth. The sun looked into it through the hottest hours of the day, and altogether it seemed uninhabitable by anything living, unless, perchance, by some wild dogs returning from scavenger duty down in Gehenna. Thence, however, and greatly to her surprise, the patient Egyptian beheld two women come, one half supporting, half leading, the other. They were both white-haired; both looked old; but their garments were not rent, and they gazed about them as if the locality were new. The witness below thought she even saw them shrink terrified at the spectacle offered by the hideous assemblage of which they found themselves part. Slight reasons, certainly, to make her heart beat faster, and draw her attention to them exclusively; but so they did.\\n\\nThe two remained by the stone awhile; then they moved slowly, painfully, and with much fear towards the well, whereat several voices were raised to stop them; yet they kept on. The drawer of water picked up some pebbles, and made ready to drive them back. The company cursed them. The greater company on the hill shouted shrilly, \\\"Unclean, unclean!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Surely,\\\" thought Amrah of the two, as they kept coming--\\\"surely, they are strangers to the usage of lepers.\\\"\\n\\nShe arose, and went to meet them, taking the basket and jar. The alarm at the well immediately subsided.\\n\\n\\\"What a fool,\\\" said one, laughing, \\\"what a fool to give good bread to the dead in that way!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And to think of her coming so far!\\\" said another. \\\"I would at least make them meet me at the gate.\\\"\\n\\nAmrah, with better impulse, proceeded. If she should be mistaken! Her heart arose into her throat. And the farther she went the more doubtful and confused she became. Four or five yards from where they stood waiting for her she stopped.\\n\\nThat the mistress she loved! whose hand she had so often kissed in gratitude! whose image of matronly loveliness she had treasured in memory so faithfully! And that the Tirzah she had nursed through babyhood! whose pains she had soothed, whose sports she had shared! that the smiling, sweet-faced, songful Tirzah, the light of the great house, the promised blessing of her old age! Her mistress, her darling-- they? The soul of the woman sickened at the sight.\\n\\n\\\"These are old women,\\\" she said to herself. \\\"I never saw them before. I will go back.\\\"\\n\\nShe turned away.\\n\\n\\\"Amrah,\\\" said one of the lepers.\\n\\nThe Egyptian dropped the jar, and looked back, trembling.\\n\\n\\\"Who called me?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Amrah.\\\"\\n\\nThe servant's wondering eyes settled upon the speaker's face.\\n\\n\\\"Who are you?\\\" she cried.\\n\\n\\\"We are they you are seeking.\\\"\\n\\nAmrah fell upon her knees.\\n\\n\\\"O my mistress, my mistress! As I have made your God my God, be he praised that he has led me to you!\\\"\\n\\nAnd upon her knees the poor overwhelmed creature began moving forward.\\n\\n\\\"Stay, Amrah! Come not nearer. Unclean, unclean!\\\"\\n\\nThe words sufficed. Amrah fell upon her face, sobbing so loud the people at the well heard her. Suddenly she arose upon her knees again.\\n\\n\\\"O my mistress, where is Tirzah?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Here I am, Amrah, here! Will you not bring me a little water?\\\"\\n\\nThe habit of the servant renewed itself. Putting back the coarse hair fallen over her face, Amrah arose and went to the basket and uncovered it.\\n\\n\\\"See,\\\" she said, \\\"here are bread and meat.\\\"\\n\\nShe would have spread the napkin upon the ground, but the mistress spoke again,\\n\\n\\\"Do not so, Amrah. Those yonder may stone you, and refuse us drink. Leave the basket with me. Take up the jar and fill it, and bring it here. We will carry them to the tomb with us. For this day you will then have rendered all the service that is lawful. Haste, Amrah.\\\"\\n\\nThe people under whose eyes all this had passed made way for the servant, and even helped her fill the jar, so piteous was the grief her countenance showed.\\n\\n\\\"Who are they?\\\" a woman asked.\\n\\nAmrah meekly answered, \\\"They used to be good to me.\\\"\\n\\nRaising the jar upon her shoulder, she hurried back. In forgetfulness, she would have gone to them, but the cry \\\"Unclean, unclean! Beware!\\\" arrested her. Placing the water by the basket, she stepped back, and stood off a little way.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Amrah,\\\" said the mistress, taking the articles into possession. \\\"This is very good of you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is there nothing more I can do?\\\" asked Amrah.\\n\\nThe mother's hand was upon the jar, and she was fevered with thirst; yet she paused, and rising, said firmly, \\\"Yes, I know that Judah has come home. I saw him at the gate night before last asleep on the step. I saw you wake him.\\\"\\n\\nAmrah clasped her hands.\\n\\n\\\"O my mistress! You saw it, and did not come!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That would have been to kill him. I can never take him in my arms again. I can never kiss him more. O Amrah, Amrah, you love him, I know!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said the true heart, bursting into tears again, and kneeling. \\\"I would die for him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Prove to me what you say, Amrah.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am ready.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you shall not tell him where we are or that you have seen us--only that, Amrah.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he is looking for you. He has come from afar to find you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He must not find us. He shall not become what we are. Hear, Amrah. You shall serve us as you have this day. You shall bring us the little we need--not long now--not long. You shall come every morning and evening thus, and--and\\\"--the voice trembled, the strong will almost broke down--\\\"and you shall tell us of him, Amrah; but to him you shall say nothing of us. Hear you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, it will be so hard to hear him speak of you, and see him going about looking for you--to see all his love, and not tell him so much as that you are alive!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you tell him we are well, Amrah?\\\"\\n\\nThe servant bowed her head in her arms.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" the mistress continued; \\\"wherefore to be silent altogether. Go now, and come this evening. We will look for you. Till then, farewell.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The burden will be heavy, O my mistress, and hard to bear,\\\" said Amrah, falling upon her face.\\n\\n\\\"How much harder would it be to see him as we are,\\\" the mother answered as she gave the basket to Tirzah. \\\"Come again this evening,\\\" she repeated, taking up the water, and starting for the tomb.\\n\\nAmrah waited kneeling until they had disappeared; then she took the road sorrowfully home.\\n\\nIn the evening she returned; and thereafter it became her custom to serve them in the morning and evening, so that they wanted for nothing needful. The tomb, though ever so stony and desolate, was less cheerless than the cell in the Tower had been. Daylight gilded its door, and it was in the beautiful world. Then, one can wait death with so much more faith out under the open sky.\\n\\nCHAPTER VI\\n\\nThe morning of the first day of the seventh month--Tishri in the Hebrew, October in English--Ben-Hur arose from his couch in the khan ill satisfied with the whole world.\\n\\nLittle time had been lost in consultation upon the arrival of Malluch. The latter began the search at the Tower of Antonia, and began it boldly, by a direct inquiry of the tribune commanding. He gave the officer a history of the Hurs, and all the particulars of the accident to Gratus, describing the affair as wholly without criminality. The object of the quest now, he said, was if any of the unhappy family were discovered alive to carry a petition to the feet of Caesar, praying restitution of the estate and return to their civil rights. Such a petition, he had no doubt, would result in an investigation by the imperial order, a proceeding of which the friends of the family had no fear.\\n\\nIn reply the tribune stated circumstantially the discovery of the women in the Tower, and permitted a reading of the memorandum he had taken of their account of themselves; when leave to copy it was prayed, he even permitted that.\\n\\nMalluch thereupon hurried to Ben-Hur.\\n\\nIt were useless to attempt description of the effect the terrible story had upon the young man. The pain was not relieved by tears or passionate outcries; it was too deep for any expression. He sat still a long time, with pallid face and laboring heart. Now and then, as if to show the thoughts which were most poignant, he muttered,\\n\\n\\\"Lepers, lepers! They--my mother and Tirzah--they lepers! How long, how long, O Lord!\\\"\\n\\nOne moment he was torn by a virtuous rage of sorrow, next by a longing for vengeance which, it must be admitted, was scarcely less virtuous.\\n\\nAt length he arose.\\n\\n\\\"I must look for them. They may be dying.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where will you look?\\\" asked Malluch.\\n\\n\\\"There is but one place for them to go.\\\"\\n\\nMalluch interposed, and finally prevailed so far as to have the management of the further attempt intrusted to him. Together they went to the gate over on the side opposite the Hill of Evil Counsel, immemorially the lepers' begging-ground. There they stayed all day, giving alms, asking for the two women, and offering rich rewards for their discovery. So they did in repetition day after day through the remainder of the fifth month, and all the sixth. There was diligent scouring of the dread city on the hill by lepers to whom the rewards offered were mighty incentives, for they were only dead in law. Over and over again the gaping tomb down by the well was invaded, and its tenants subjected to inquiry; but they kept their secret fast. The result was failure. And now, the morning of the first day of the seventh month, the extent of the additional information gained was that not long before two leprous women had been stoned from the Fish Gate by the authorities. A little pressing of the clew, together with some shrewd comparison of dates, led to the sad assurance that the sufferers were the Hurs, and left the old questions darker than ever. Where were they? And what had become of them?\\n\\n\\\"It was not enough that my people should be made lepers,\\\" said the son, over and over again, with what intensity of bitterness the reader may imagine; \\\"that was not enough. Oh no! They must be stoned from their native city! My mother is dead! she has wandered to the wilderness! she is dead! Tirzah is dead! I alone am left. And for what? How long, O God, thou Lord God of my fathers, how long shall this Rome endure?\\\"\\n\\nAngry, hopeless, vengeful, he entered the court of the khan, and found it crowded with people come in during the night. While he ate his breakfast, he listened to some of them. To one party he was specially attracted. They were mostly young, stout, active, hardy men, in manner and speech provincial. In their look, the certain indefinable air, the pose of the head, glance of the eye, there was a spirit which did not, as a rule, belong to the outward seeming of the lower orders of Jerusalem; the spirit thought by some to be a peculiarity of life in mountainous districts, but which may be more surely traced to a life of healthful freedom. In a short time he ascertained they were Galileans, in the city for various purposes, but chiefly to take part in the Feast of Trumpets, set for that day. They became to him at once objects of interest, as hailing from the region in which he hoped to find readiest support in the work he was shortly to set about.\\n\\nWhile observing them, his mind running ahead in thought of achievements possible to a legion of such spirits disciplined after the severe Roman style, a man came into the court, his face much flushed, his eyes bright with excitement.\\n\\n\\\"Why are you here?\\\" he said to the Galileans. \\\"The rabbis and elders are going from the Temple to see Pilate. Come, make haste, and let us go with them.\\\"\\n\\nThey surrounded him in a moment.\\n\\n\\\"To see Pilate! For what?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They have discovered a conspiracy. Pilate's new aqueduct is to be paid for with money of the Temple.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What, with the sacred treasure?\\\"\\n\\nThey repeated the question to each other with flashing eyes.\\n\\n\\\"It is Corban--money of God. Let him touch a shekel of it if he dare!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come,\\\" cried the messenger. \\\"The procession is by this time across the bridge. The whole city is pouring after. We may be needed. Make haste!\\\"\\n\\nAs if the thought and the act were one, there was quick putting away of useless garments, and the party stood forth bareheaded, and in the short sleeveless under-tunics they were used to wearing as reapers in the field and boatmen on the lake--the garb in which they climbed the hills following the herds, and plucked the ripened vintage, careless of the sun. Lingering only to tighten their girdles, they said, \\\"We are ready.\\\"\\n\\nThen Ben-Hur spoke to them.\\n\\n\\\"Men of Galilee,\\\" he said, \\\"I am a son of Judah. Will you take me in your company?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We may have to fight,\\\" they replied.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, then, I will not be first to run away!\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640148191,\"title\":\"Ben-Hur's scheme, be it observed, was as yet a generality.\"},\"digest\":\"e-crz7UXtT9C57uu13JwzdL8UED7A5cSAtmtdxTROcI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x24afE23f920156bA8F2a4d44dC48E4796972746b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DKwygxYr4zk_-GHmuQj6aXwXHi3jnCM3SO6VfkKbTos\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"orlsqFTFZfvD8NPD4w3Vp3FDXF6k0xRAd37NFnUbU8Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"gLfTV04zOMfsmaIHeL2tuf_KUTVSfd7vVSjkyhcotc1ejZ--ZYDO7sTPm9HVM1lJFVSw-AZagvlPFEdc4RwvSw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb9ded49e5c211b2d6f677142c75eeeac75cc8e8477731b45f29192b076ae9fd446f8f1efbcdd95f36a8ee49d89a04bd64393dd764c2842e0899c7d1a7ca310081c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"DKwygxYr4zk_-GHmuQj6aXwXHi3jnCM3SO6VfkKbTos\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"orlsqFTFZfvD8NPD4w3Vp3FDXF6k0xRAd37NFnUbU8Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"e-crz7UXtT9C57uu13JwzdL8UED7A5cSAtmtdxTROcI\"}"
