"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"They started and walked the way which Ayala remembered so well when she had trudged along, pretending to listen to Sir Harry and Captain Glomax as they carried on their discussion about the hunted fox, but giving all her ears to the Colonel, and wondering whether he would say anything to her before the day was over. Then her mind had been in a perturbed state which she herself had failed to understand. She was sure that she would say \\\"No\\\" to him, should he speak, and yet she desired that it should be \\\"Yes\\\". What a fool she had been, she told herself as she walked along now, and how little she had deserved all the good that had come to her!\\n\\nThe conversation was chiefly with him as they went. He told her much now of the how, and the when, and the where. He hoped there might be no long delay. He would live, he said, for the next year or two at Aldershot, and would be able to get a house fit for her on condition that they should be married at once. He did not explain why the house could not be taken even though their marriage were delayed two or three months -- but as to this she asked no questions. Of course they must be married in London if Mrs Dosett wished it; but if not it might be arranged that the wedding should take place at Stalham. Upon all this and many other things he had much to propose, and all that he said Ayala accepted as gospel. As the Angel of Light had appeared -- as the knight who was lord of the castle had come forth -- of course he must be obeyed in everything. He could hardly have made a suggestion to which she would not have acceded. When they had entered the wood Ayala in her own quiet way led him to the very spot in which on that former day he had asked her his question. \\\"Do you remember this path?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"I remember that you and I were walking here together,\\\" he said. \\\"Ay, but this very turn? Do you remember this branch?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, no; not the branch.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You put your hand on it when you said that 'never -- never,' to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did I say 'never -- never'?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you did -- when I was so untrue to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were you untrue?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"Jonathan, you remember nothing about it. It has all passed away from you just as though you were talking to Captain Glomax about the fox.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Has it, dear?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I remember every word of it. I remember how you stood and how you looked, even to the hat you wore and the little switch you held in your hand -- when you asked for one little word, one glance, one slightest touch. There, now -- you shall have all my weight to bear.\\\" Then she leant upon him with both her hands, turned round her arm, glanced up into his face, and opened her lips as though speaking that little word. \\\"Do you remember that I said I thought you had given it all up?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I remember that, certainly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And was not that untrue? Oh, Jonathan, that was such a story. Had I thought so I should have been miserable.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then why did you swear to me so often that you could not love me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never said so,\\\" replied Ayala; \\\"never.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you not?\\\" he asked.\\n\\n\\\"I never said so. I never told you such a story as that. I did love you then, almost as well as I do now. Oh, I had loved you for so long a time!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then why did you refuse me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah; that is what I would explain to you now -- here on this very spot -- if I could. Does it not seem odd that a girl should have all that she wants offered to her, and yet not be able to take it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Was it all that you wanted!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed it was. When I was in church that morning I told myself that I never, never could be happy unless you came to me again.\\\" \\\"But when I did come you would not have me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I knew how to love you,\\\" she said, \\\"but I did not know how to tell you that I loved you. I can tell you now; cannot I?\\\" and then she looked up at him and smiled. \\\"Yes, I think I shall never be tired of telling you now. It is sweet to hear you say that you love me, but it is sweeter still to be always telling you. And yet I could not tell you then. Suppose you had taken me at my word?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I told you that I should never give you up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It was only that that kept me from being altogether wretched. I think that I was ashamed to tell you the truth when I had once refused to do as you would have me. I had given you so much trouble all for nothing. I think that if you had asked me on that first day at the ball in London I should have said yes, if I had told the truth.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That would have been very sudden. I had never seen you before that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nevertheless it was so. I don't mind owning it to you now, though I never, never, would own it to anyone else. When you came to us at the theatre I was sure that no one else could ever have been so good: I certainly did love you then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hardly that, Ayala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did,\\\" she said. \\\"Now I have told you everything, and if you choose to think I have been bad -- why you must think so, and I must put up with it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Bad, my darling?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose it was bad to fall in love with a man like that; and very bad to give him the trouble of coming so often. But now I have made a clean breast of it, and if you want to scold me you must scold me now. You may do it now, but you must never scold me afterwards -- because of that.\\\" It may be left to the reader to imagine the nature of the scolding which she received. Then on their way home she thanked him for all the good that he had done to all those belonging to her. \\\"I have heard it all from Lucy -- how generous you have been to Isadore.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That has all come to nothing,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"How come to nothing? I know that you sent him the money.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did offer to lend him something, and, indeed, I sent him a cheque; but two days afterwards he returned it. That tremendous uncle of yours -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Uncle Tom?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, your Uncle Tom; the man of millions! He came forward and cut me out altogether. I don't know what went on down there in Sussex, but when he heard that they intended to be married shortly he put his hand into his pocket, as a magnificent uncle, overflowing with millions, ought to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did not hear that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hamel sent my money back at once.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And poor Tom! You were so good to poor Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like Tom.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he did behave badly.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well; yes. One gentleman shouldn't strike another, even though he be ever so much in love. It's an uncomfortable proceeding, and never has good results. But then, poor fellow, he has been so much in earnest.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why couldn't he take a No when he got it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why didn't I take a No when I got it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That was very different. He ought to have taken it. If you had taken it you would have been very wrong, and have broken a poor girl's heart. I am sure you knew that all through.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did I?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then you were too good-natured. That was it. I don't think you really love me -- not as I love you. Oh, Jonathan, if you were to change your mind now! Suppose you were to tell me that it was a mistake! Suppose I were to awake and find myself in bed at Kingsbury Crescent?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope there may be no such waking as that!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should go mad -- stark mad. Shake me till I find out whether it is real waking, downright, earnest. But, Jonathan, why did you call me Miss Dormer when you went away? That was the worst of all. I remember when you called me Ayala first. It went through and through me like an electric shock. But you never saw it -- did you?\\\"\\n\\nOn that afternoon when she returned home she wrote to her sister Lucy, giving a sister's account to her sister of all her happiness. \\\"I am sure Isadore is second best, but Jonathan is best. I don't want you to say so; but if you contradict me I shall stick to it. You remember my telling you that the old woman in the railway said that I was perverse. She was a clever old woman, and knew all about it, for I was perverse. However, it has come all right now, and Jonathan is best of all. Oh, my man -- my man! Is it not sweet to have a man of one's own to love?\\\" If this letter had been written on the day before -- as would have been the case had not Ayala been taken out hunting -- it would have reached Merle Park on the Wednesday, the news would have been made known to Aunt Emmeline, and so conveyed to poor Tom, and that disagreeable journey from Merle Park to Stalham would have been saved. But there was no time for writing on the Monday. The letter was sent away in the Stalham post-bag on the Tuesday evening, and did not reach Merle Park till the Thursday, after Lady Tringle had left the house. Had it been known on that morning that Ayala was engaged to Colonel Stubbs that would have sufficed to send Tom away upon his travels without any more direct messenger from Stalham.\\n\\nOn the Wednesday there was more hunting, and on this day Ayala, having liberated her mind to her lover in Gobblegoose Wood, was able to devote herself more satisfactorily to the amusement in hand. Her engagement was now an old affair. It had already become matter for joking to Sir Harry, and had been discussed even with Mrs Gosling. It was, of course, \\\"a joy for ever' -- but still she was beginning to descend from the clouds and to walk the earth  -- no more than a simple queen. When, therefore, the hounds went away and Larry told her that he knew the best way out of the wood, she collected her energies and rode \\\"like a little brick\\\", as Sir Harry said when they got back to Stalham. On that afternoon she received the note from her aunt and replied to it by telegram.\\n\\nOn the Thursday she stayed at home and wrote various letters. The first was to the Marchesa, and then one to Nina -- in both of which much had to be said about \\\"Jonathan.\\\" To Nina also she could repeat her idea of the delight of having a man to love. Then there was a letter to Aunt Margaret -- which certainly was due, and another to Aunt Emmeline -- which was not however received until after Lady Tringle's visit to Stalham. There was much conversation between her and Lady Albury as to the possible purpose of the visit which was to be made on the morrow. Lady Albury was of opinion that Lady Tringle had heard of the engagement, and was coming with the intention of setting it on one side on Tom's behalf. \\\"But she can't do that, you know,\\\" said Ayala, with some manifest alarm. \\\"She is nothing to me now, Lady Albury. She got rid of me, you know. I was changed away for Lucy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If there had been no changing away, she could do nothing,\\\" said Lady Albury.\\n\\nAbout a quarter of an hour before the time for lunch on the following day Lady Tringle was shown into the small sitting-room which has been mentioned in a previous chapter, and Ayala, radiant with happiness and beauty, appeared before her. There was a look about her of being at home at Stalham, as though she were almost a daughter of the house, that struck her aunt with surprise. There was nothing left of that submissiveness which, though Ayala herself had not been submissive, belonged, as of right, to girls so dependent as she and her sister Lucy. \\\"I am so delighted to see you at Stalham,\\\" said Ayala, as she embraced her aunt.\\n\\n\\\"I am come to you\\\", said Lady Tringle, \\\"on a matter of very particular business.\\\" Then she paused, and assumed a look of peculiar solemnity. \\\"Have you got my letter?\\\" demanded Ayala.\\n\\n\\\"I got your telegram, and I thought it very civil of Lady Albury. But I cannot stay. Your poor cousin Tom is in such a condition that I cannot leave him longer than I can help.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you have not got my letter?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have had no letter from you, Ayala.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have sent you such news -- oh, such news, Aunt Emmeline!\\\" \\\"What news, my dear?\\\" Lady Tringle as she asked the question seemed to become more solemn than ever.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Aunt Emmeline -- I am -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are what, Ayala?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am engaged to be married to Colonel Jonathan Stubbs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Engaged!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Aunt Emmeline -- engaged. I wrote to you on Tuesday to tell you all about it. I hope you and Uncle Tom will approve. There cannot possibly be any reason against it -- except only that I have nothing to give him in return; that is in the way of money. Colonel Stubbs, Aunt Emmeline, is not what Uncle Tom will call a rich man, but everybody here says that he has got quite enough to be comfortable. If he had nothing in the world it could not make any difference to me. I don't understand how anybody is to love anyone or not to love him just because he is rich or poor.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you are absolutely engaged!\\\" exclaimed Lady Tringle.\\n\\n\\\"Oh dear yes. Perhaps you would like to ask Lady Albury about it. He did want it before, you know.\\n\\n\\\"But now you are engaged to him?\\\" In answer to this Ayala thought it sufficient simply to nod her head. \\\"It is all over then?\\\" \\\"All over!\\\" exclaimed Ayala. \\\"It is just going to begin.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All over for poor Tom,\\\" said Lady Tringle.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes. It was always over for him, Aunt Emmeline. I told him ever so many times that it never could be so. Don't you know, Aunt Emmeline, that I did?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you said that to this man just the same.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Aunt Emmeline,\\\" said Ayala, putting on all the serious dignity which she knew how to assume, \\\"I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs, and nothing on earth that anybody can say can change it. If you want to hear all about it, Lady Albury will tell you. She knows that you are my aunt, and therefore she will be quite willing to talk to you. Only nothing that anybody can say can change it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poor Tom!\\\" ejaculated the rejected lover's mother.\\n\\n\\\"I am very sorry if my cousin is displeased.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is ill -- terribly ill. He will have to go away and travel all about the world, and I don't know that ever he will come back again. I am sure this Stubbs will never love you as he has done.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, aunt, what is the use of that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And then Tom will have twice as much. But, however -- \\\" Ayala stood silent, not seeing that any good could be done by addition to her former assurances. \\\"I will go and tell him, my dear, that's all. Will you not send him some message, Ayala?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes; any message that I can that shall go along with my sincere attachment to Colonel Stubbs. You must tell him that I am engaged to Colonel Stubbs. You will tell him, Aunt Emmeline?\\\" \\\"Oh, yes; if it must be so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It must,\\\" said Ayala. \\\"Then you may give him my love, and tell him that I am very unhappy that I should have been a trouble to him, and that I hope he will soon be well, and come back from his travels.\\\" By this time Aunt Emmeline was dissolved in tears. \\\"I could not help it, Aunt Emmeline, could I?\\\" Her aunt had once terribly outraged her feelings by telling her that she had encouraged Tom. Ayala remembered at this moment the cruel words and the wound which they had inflicted on her; but, nevertheless, she behaved tenderly, and endeavoured to be respectful and submissive. \\\"I could not help it -- could I, Aunt Emmeline?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose not, my dear.\\\"\\n\\nAfter that Lady Tringle declared that she would return to London at once. No -- she would rather not go in to lunch. She would rather go back at once to the station if they would take her. She had been weeping, and did not wish to show her tears. Therefore, at Ayala's request, the carriage came round again -- to the great disgust, no doubt, of the coachman -- and Lady Tringle was taken back to the station without having seen any of the Albury family.\\n\\nCHAPTER 57 CAPTAIN BATSBY IN LOMBARD STREET\\n\\nIt was not till Colonel Stubbs had been three or four days at Stalham, basking in the sunshine of Ayala's love, that any of the Stalham family heard of the great event which had occurred in the life of Ayala's third lover. During that walk to and from Gobblegoose Wood something had been said between the lovers as to Captain Batsby -- something, no doubt, chiefly in joke. The idea of the poor Captain having fallen suddenly into so melancholy a condition was droll enough. \\\"But he never spoke to me,\\\" said Ayala. \\\"He doesn't speak very much to anyone,\\\" said the Colonel, \\\"but he thinks a great deal about things. He has had ever so many affairs with ever so many ladies, who generally, I fancy, want to marry him because of his money. How he has escaped so long nobody knows.\\\" A man when he has just engaged himself to be married is as prone as ever to talk of other men \\\"escaping\\\", feeling that, though other young ladies were no better than evils to be avoided, his young lady is to be regarded as almost a solitary instance of a blessing. Then, two days afterwards, arrived the news of the trip to Ostend. Sir Harry received a letter from a friend in which an account was given of his half-brother's adventure. \\\"What do you think has happened?\\\" said Sir Harry, jumping up from his chair at the breakfast table.\\n\\n\\\"What has happened?\\\" asked his wife.\\n\\n\\\"Benjamin has run off to Ostend with a young lady.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Benjamin -- with a young lady!\\\" exclaimed Lady Albury. Ayala and Stubbs were equally astonished, each of them knowing that the Captain had been excluded from Stalham because of the ardour of his unfortunate love for Ayala. \\\"Ayala, that is your doing!\\\" \\\"No!\\\" said Ayala. \\\"But I am very glad if he's happy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Who is the young lady?\\\" asked Stubbs.\\n\\n\\\"It is that which makes it so very peculiar,\\\" said Sir Harry, looking at Ayala. He had learned something of the Tringle family, and was aware of Ayala's connection with them.\\n\\n\\\"Who is it, Harry?\\\" demanded her ladyship.\\n\\n\\\"Sir Thomas Tringle's younger daughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gertrude!\\\" exclaimed Ayala, who also knew of the engagement with Mr Houston.\\n\\n\\\"But the worst of it is\\\", continued Sir Harry, \\\"that he is not at all happy. The young lady has come back, while nobody knows what has become of Benjamin.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Benjamin never will get a wife,\\\" said Lady Albury. Thus all the details of the little event became known at Stalham -- except the immediate condition and whereabouts of the lover.\\n\\nOf the Captain's condition and whereabouts something must be told. When the great disruption came, and he had been abused and ridiculed by Sir Thomas at Ostend, he felt that he could neither remain there where the very waiters knew what had happened, nor could he return to Dover in the same vessel with Sir Thomas and his daughter. He therefore took the first train and went to Brussels.\\n\\nBut Brussels did not offer him many allurements in his present frame of mind. He found nobody there whom he particularly knew, and nothing particular to do. Solitude in a continental town with no amusements beyond those offered by the table d'hote and the theatre is oppressing. His time he endeavoured to occupy with thinking of the last promise he had made to Gertrude. Should he break it or should he keep it? Sir Thomas Tringle was, no doubt, a very rich man -- and then there was the fact which would become known to all the world, that he had run off with a young lady. Should he ultimately succeed in marrying the young lady the enterprise would bear less of an appearance of failure than it would do otherwise. But then, should the money not be forthcoming, the consolation coming from the possession of Gertrude herself would hardly suffice to make him a happy man. Sir Thomas, when he came to consider the matter, would certainly feel that his daughter had compromised herself by the journey, and that it would be good for her to be married to the man who had taken her. It might be that Sir Thomas would yield, and consent to make, at any rate, some compromise. A rumour had reached his ears that Traffick had received L#200,000 with the elder daughter. He would consent to take half that sum. After a week spent amidst the charms of Brussels he returned to London, without any public declaration of his doing so -- \\\"sneaked back\\\", as a friend of his said of him at the club -- and then went to work to carry out his purpose as best he might. All that was known of it at Stalham was that he had returned to his lodgings in London.\\n\\nOn Friday, the 11th of April, when Ayala was a promised bride of nearly two weeks' standing and all the uncles and aunts were aware that her lot in life had been fixed for her, Sir Thomas was alone in the back room in Lombard Street, with his mind sorely diverted from the only joy of his life. The whole family were now in town, and Septimus Traffick with his wife was actually occupying a room in Queen's Gate. How it had come to pass Sir Thomas hardly knew. Some word had been extracted from him signifying a compliance with a request that Augusta might come to the house for a night or two until a fitting residence should be prepared for her. Something had been said of Lord Boardotrade's house being vacated for her and her husband early in April. An occurrence to which married ladies are liable was about to take place with Augusta, and Sir Thomas certainly understood that the occurrence was to be expected under the roof of the coming infant's noble grandfather. Something as to ancestral halls had been thrown out in the chance way of conversation. Then he certainly had assented to some minimum of London hospitality for his daughter -- as certainly not including the presence of his son-in-law; and now both of them were domiciled in the big front spare bedroom at Queen's Gate! This perplexed him sorely. And then Tom had been brought up from the country still as an invalid, his mother moaning and groaning over him as though he were sick almost past hope of recovery. And yet the nineteenth of the month, now only eight days distant, was still fixed for his departure. Tom, on the return of his mother from Stalham, had to a certain extent accepted as irrevocable the fact of which she bore the tidings. Ayala was engaged to Stubbs, and would, doubtless, with very little delay, become Mrs Jonathan Stubbs. \\\"I knew it,\\\" he said; \\\"I knew it. Nothing could have prevented it unless I had shot him through the heart. He told me that she had refused him; but no man could have looked like that after being refused by Ayala.\\\" Then he never expressed a hope again. It was all over for him as regarded Ayala. But he still refused to be well, or even, for a day or two, to leave his bed. He had allowed his mother to understand that if the fact of her engagement were indubitably brought home to him he would gird up his loins for his journey and proceed at once wherever it might be thought good to send him. His father had sternly reminded him of his promise; but, when so reminded, Tom had turned himself in his bed and uttered groans instead of replies. Now he had been brought up to London and was no longer actually in bed; but even yet he had not signified his intention of girding up his loins and proceeding upon his journey. Nevertheless the preparations were going on, and, under Sir Thomas's directions, the portmanteaus were already being packed. Gertrude also was a source of discomfort to her father. She considered herself to have been deprived of her two lovers, one after the other, in a spirit of cruel parsimony. And with this heavy weight upon her breast she refused to take any part in the family conversations. Everything had been done for Augusta, and everything was to be done for Tom. For her nothing had been done, and nothing had been promised -- and she was therefore very sulky. With these troubles all around him, Sir Thomas was sitting oppressed and disheartened in Lombard Street on Friday, the 11th of April.\\n\\nThen there entered to him one of the junior clerks with a card announcing the name of Captain Batsby. He looked at it for some seconds before he gave any notification of his intention, and then desired the young man to tell the gentleman that he would not see him. The message had been delivered, and Captain Batsby with a frown of anger on his brow was about to shake the dust off from his feet on the uncourteous threshold when there came another message, saying that Captain Batsby could go in and see Sir Thomas if he wished it. Upon this he turned round and was shown into the little sitting-room. \\\"Well, Captain Batsby,\\\" said Sir Thomas; \\\"what can I do for you now? I am glad to see that you have come back safely from foreign parts.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have called\\\", said the Captain, \\\"to say something about your daughter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What more can you have to say about her?\\\"\\n\\nAt this the Captain was considerably puzzled. Of course Sir Thomas must know what he had to say. \\\"The way in which we were separated at Ostend was very distressing to my feelings.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I daresay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And also I should think to Miss Tringle's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not improbably. I have always observed that when people are interrupted in the performance of some egregious stupidity their feelings are hurt. As I said before, what can I do for you now?\\\" \\\"I am very anxious to complete the alliance which I have done myself the honour to propose to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did not know that you had proposed anything. You came down to my house under a false pretence; and then you persuaded my daughter -- or else she persuaded you -- to go off together to Ostend. Is that what you call an alliance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That, as far as it went, was -- was an elopement.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Am I to understand that you now want to arrange another elopement, and that you have come to ask my consent?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh dear no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then what do you mean by completing an alliance?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to make\\\", said the Captain, \\\"an offer for the young lady's hand in a proper form. I consider myself to be in a position which justifies me in doing so. I am possessed of the young lady's affections, and have means of my own equal to those which I presume you will be disposed to give her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very much better means I hope, Captain Batsby. Otherwise I do not see what you and your wife would have to live upon. I will tell you exactly what my feelings are in this matter. My daughter has gone off with you, forgetting all the duty that she owed to me and to her mother, and throwing aside all ideas of propriety. After that I will not say that you shall not marry her if both of you think fit. I do not doubt your means, and I have no reason for supposing that you would be cruel to her. You are two fools, but after all fools must live in the world. What I do say is, that I will not give a sixpence towards supporting you in your folly. Now, Captain Batsby, you can complete the alliance or not as you please.\\\"\\n\\nCaptain Batsby had been called a fool also at Ostend, and there, amidst the distressing circumstances of his position, had been constrained to bear the opprobrious name, little customary as it is for one gentleman to allow himself to be called a fool by another; but now he had collected his thoughts, had reminded himself of his position in the world, and had told himself that it did not become him to be too humble before this City man of business. It might have been all very well at Ostend; but he was not going to be called a fool in London without resenting it. \\\"Sir Thomas,\\\" said he, \\\"fool and folly are terms which I cannot allow you to use to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you do not present yourself to me here, Captain Batsby, or at my own house -- or, perhaps I may say, at Ostend -- I will use no such terms to you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose you will acknowledge that I am entitled to ask for your daughter's hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose you will acknowledge that when a man runs away with my daughter I am entitled to express my opinion of his conduct.\\\" \\\"That is all over now, Sir Thomas. What I did I did for love. There is no good in crying over spilt milk. The question is as to the future happiness of the young lady.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That is the only wise word I have heard you say, Captain Batsby. There is no good in crying after spilt milk. Our journey to Ostend is done and gone. It was not very agreeable, but we have lived through it. I quite think that you show a good judgment in not intending to go there again in quest of a clergyman. If you want to be married there are plenty of them in London. I will not oppose your marriage, but I will not give you a shilling. No man ever had a better opportunity of showing the disinterestedness of his affection. Now, good morning.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But, Sir Thomas -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Captain Batsby, my time is precious. I have told you all that there is to tell.\\\" Then he stood up, and the Captain with a stern demeanour and angry brow left the room and took himself in silence away from Lombard Street.\\n\\n\\\"Do you want to marry Captain Batsby?\\\" Sir Thomas said to his daughter that evening, having invited her to come apart with him after dinner.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You think that you prefer him on the whole to Mr Houston?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr Houston is a scoundrel. I wish that you would not talk about him, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like him so much the best of the two,\\\" said Sir Thomas. \\\"But of course it is for you to judge. I could have brought myself to give something to Houston. Luckily, however, Captain Batsby has got an income of his own.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He has, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you are sure that you would like to take him as your husband?\\\" \\\"Yes, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well. He has been with me today.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is he in London?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I tell you that he has been with me today in Lombard Street.\\\" \\\"What did he say? Did he say anything about me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, my dear. He came to ask me for your hand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, papa.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I told him that I should make no objection -- that I should leave it altogether to you. I only interfered with one small detail as to my own wishes. I assured him that I should never give him or you a single shilling.
