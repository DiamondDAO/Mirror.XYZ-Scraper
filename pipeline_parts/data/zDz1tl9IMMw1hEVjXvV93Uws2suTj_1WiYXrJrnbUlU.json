"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"To date, across Europe's Big 5 leagues, 17 teams have a goal differential of +5 or higher in these transition possessions.\\n\\n* +14: Bayern Munich (18 scored, four allowed)\\n* +10: [Real Madrid](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=86) (15-5), Inter Milan (14-4), [Montpellier](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=274) (13-3)\\n* +8: [Sevilla](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=243) (8-0)\\n* +7: Atalanta (16-9), [Bayer Leverkusen](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=131) (14-7), [Leicester City](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=375) (12-5), [Liverpool](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=364) (12-5)\\n* +6: Rennes (10-4), Manchester City (8-2)\\n* +5: [Atletico Madrid](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=1068) (12-7), [Real Betis](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=244) (12-7), [Marseille](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=176) (9-4), [Chelsea](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=363) (8-3), [West Ham United](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=371) (8-3), [Nice](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2502) (6-1)\\n\\nFour of five current league leaders are accounted for among this group while the fifth, [France](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=478)'s PSG, sit at +1 (8-7). Only one team across the leagues has managed to average 1.7 points per game or more with a negative goal differential in transition possessions: Freiburg, with 29 points and a minus-3 differential.\\n\\nPredictably, the teams with the worst goal differentials in these possessions are primarily the worst teams in these leagues. Fifteen teams have a goal differential of -5 or worse:\\n\\n* -12: [Metz](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=177) (four scored, 16 allowed)\\n* -11: [Saint-Etienne](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=178) (2-13), [Levante](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=1538) (2-13)\\n* -10: Stuttgart (5-15), Greuther Furth (4-14)\\n* -9: [Leeds United](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=357) (5-14)\\n* -8: [Norwich City](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=381) (1-9)\\n* -7: [Lazio](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=112) (5-12), Newcastle (5-12), [Salernitana](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=3240) (2-9)\\n* -5: [Hertha Berlin](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=129) (6-11), [Cagliari](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=2925) (5-10), [Genoa](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=3263) (3-8), [Osasuna](https://www.espn.com/soccer/team?id=97) (2-7), Deportivo Alaves (0-5)\\n\\nThe most interesting names on this list: Leeds and Lazio.\\n\\nLeeds were +5 in this department last season, scoring 21 and allowing 16. This season, they're on pace to score about half those transition goals while allowing twice as many. They are attempting more shots per transition possession this season, but their shot quality is dreadful. They have been unlucky to allow 14 goals from just 8.4 xG in these transition possessions, but a 2020-21 advantage has turned into a rather drastic disadvantage in 2021-22. Only Metz and Stuttgart have seen their per-game goal differential from transition possessions flip more from last season.\\n\\nLazio, meanwhile, remain a decent team -- good enough to advance to the Europa League knockout rounds and take seven points from league matches against Roma, Inter and Atalanta. But they've allowed 11 transition goals across eight matches, from which they managed only two wins, two draws and four losses. It's cost them dearly, and they're eight points back of a top-four spot heading into the holiday season.\\n\\nHere are some other transition-related storylines from across the Big 5.\",\"timestamp\":1640307213,\"title\":\"What can transition stats tell about the 2021-22 season?\"},\"digest\":\"HE5nBqQKOoMfbm0pjLeamGQ7jGR7ylNNHZaAIF3TPws\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x39d28336458332603a67C2002101b1e1A061FCA0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1J6JAIfb99YiAz_1O_srKkWMldaohj3zRzAR_OVBQNg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CDnGTuIcRwoc8EkTFuo_isRtaYnOXwgE8Cjp91nDufg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"PMaO_NGg30A54-Fxvov4Qoozf8I_vJkZkdIWr9D70B4vKT0u7BW1uzGmO_UqPcffRjT-zJh_4bTy_kYNvruoeg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0712b410bf0212aeab81cd6206b3657bcadce009211611c873156df612d887f767d78125b30b67df4a6e56fc02bf66dee52d566a6f06fc22d99defddc070b0681b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1J6JAIfb99YiAz_1O_srKkWMldaohj3zRzAR_OVBQNg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"CDnGTuIcRwoc8EkTFuo_isRtaYnOXwgE8Cjp91nDufg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HE5nBqQKOoMfbm0pjLeamGQ7jGR7ylNNHZaAIF3TPws\"}"
