"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In the next five years of development, Metaverse will continue to emerge on the track and lead the entire field of technology. In the meta-universe world, with the support of AR and VR, people in the meta-universe will achieve a huge leap across time and space in industrial technology, work scenes, social networking and other related fields. In the meta-universe concept, the coverage and development of social networks are the key to its virtual identity.\\n\\nThe source of the meta-universe originated from Neal Stephenson's book \\\"Avalanche\\\". In the story of \\\"Avalanche\\\", a \\\"super meta-domain\\\" was constructed outside the real world, with a brand new identity in this world Another virtual world completely different. Whether it is all kinds of \\\"time and space\\\" in the sci-fi world or emerging meta-universe games such as Roblex and Decentraland , social needs are the focus of attention both inside and outside the industry.\\n\\nIn the music festival in the meta universe, the entry of the whole body avatar and the creation of the world are all planned based on the player's social needs. In the new virtual time and space, a completely different from reality, the attractiveness of virtual identity will surpass any game. The establishment of identity requires various social activities, contacts, and even asset ownership to integrate into a virtual image.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m-uhNMmCHm65aSWmU-Abx.png?height=209&width=600)\\n\\nTerra Nulla is a GameFi concept game launched on the MPC platform. The game takes the meta-universe infrastructure as the entry point, combines NFT and DeFi , creates a unique player interaction and worker recruitment mechanism based on social needs, and creates its own player gathering to create More value.\\n\\nSocial needs will become the gravitational engine of meta-universe games\\nIn the meta-universe, players have established a new world system. In any social system, the social attributes are much higher than the game itself, and the social attributes have a certain degree of dependence and stability. Once a stable model is formed, it is difficult to break the game. Change. Terra Nulla began with the laying and establishment of the meta-universe network of people, and tailored second life for players with a new identity, which fully guaranteed the foundation of meta-universe carrying digital identities.\\n\\nTerra Nulla's positioning is no longer limited to ordinary building development games on the market, but a meta-universe space-time with social attributes. From the gameplay mechanism, Terra Nulla uses three core mechanisms to ensure the establishment of the interpersonal network.\\n\\n1. Increase retention and form dependence\\n\\nAfter entering the game, wandering around does not make a home in the game established. Every character holding a character NFT needs to help each other, work on the same land and pledge to build their dream home. The more roles of workers gather in the land, the faster the land will be profitable. In addition, players who hold land can increase the computing power of workers by staking tokens, which can attract a large number of workers to pledge themselves in a short period of time, thereby increasing higher income. Guide players to form their own centripetal force and establish a network of relationships.\\n\\n1. Expand revenue\\n\\nPersonal income is directly proportional to the number of Workers on the land. When there are more Workers on the same land, the higher the income on the land, and the higher the income of individual workers. On the other hand, 500 MPCs are released every day at the beginning of the game, and the released MPCs continue to increase as the number of players increases. This means that the active influx of players in each round opens a new round of asset upgrades for the original players: as the number of MPCs in the pool gradually increases, the daily income becomes more abundant.\\n\\n1. Deep bundling\\n\\nSocial communication enables players to communicate with each other and constitutes the cornerstone of information exchange, providing players with a sense of existence and value. In the game mechanism set up by Terra Nulla, social promotion is fully reflected in all aspects of interaction. It can effectively promote the deep bundling and conversion of games behind the social needs.\\n\\nWorker NFT upgrade. Every two Worker NFTs of the same level and attributes can be combined and upgraded to Advanced Worker NFT. When upgraded to the highest level of Worker NFT, the total computing power will increase by up to 2.7 times. When players have different WorkerNFTs, they can replace NFTs with each other after communication, so that their NFTs can synthesize advanced Worker NFTs to increase their own income. After this exchange replacement mode is formed, social communication becomes an inevitable demand for high income. Only when the information is fully communicated can the maximum benefit be reached under the current conditions.\\n\\nPlayer recruitment mechanism, on the land pledged by BOSS, the more workers there are, the higher the income will be. This determines that the linkage and recruitment of all players directly determines their own revenue. Players with BOSSNFT's appeal is directly linked to the level of income, and will use their own influence effects to pave the way for their future interpersonal networks.\\n\\nEveryone can share their NFT link to invite other players. After other players successfully pledge their NFT, the sharer will receive 2 MPC rewards, which will urge players to continue to break the inherent game social circle and expand the game boundary.\\n\\nTerra Nulla's circle system\\nIn the meta-universe established by Terra Nulla, more or less social demand stimulus points have been added from the establishment of ecological content, life cycle planning, and game revenue settings, using the social relationships and games in which players have high value. Experience. In order to ensure their inherent status and benefits in the meta-universe world, players will continue to participate in the game mechanics to maintain the stability of the current relationship with other players, form their own high-value status, form a virtuous circle, and eventually form a composition of all participants A network of value relationships at different levels. Terra Nulla paved a social tunnel to the meta universe in the background of the game. When players have their own social network, it is a stable economic system society in the meta-universe of MPC: everyone can find their own position and goals in it, and stability and freedom determine people's access to it. Feelings of the world outside of reality.\\n\\nA sense of value revolution that is out of touch with reality is about to come. Metaverse has the advantage of a natural new type of social relationship carrier. The major technology giants have entered the Metaverse one after another. After the explosion of technology, the development and growth of countless metaverse ecological economy and relationship networks will be born. It is reported that Terra Nulla has sold more than 3,000 blind boxes, and its function coincides with the context of social relations. The more exchanges between holders, the easier it is to stimulate stability and high returns among players. Now it seems that Terra Nulla has undoubtedly gained the first opportunity, and is about to start a powerful competition on the meta-universe circuit.\",\"timestamp\":1639483279,\"title\":\"MPCâ€™s social meta-universe: an overlay system network derived from NFT\"},\"digest\":\"HLksXda9SqKWR9j2I-yI02v7wxS3Hc88j2902CTqNXY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x789BCF6faAf4739F99579A7b9b274044D84564C2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e-9RhmhTndT299tL55DPwFi8cbbnl1xbHTNULh9wtNs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"j4kkYbjpyuHmknVf6YKmAoC-4Q-SyvkLmIvPR7FVuzI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wj-n4HgQWr3PqW-A-W6L3GDhy1qC-Wgs9Bs_iTMuy7o9AdVJA9MJoFFtmI2lT0GKSP4T626l0LSJ42kB9WlLmw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x58b621b1c8936f4b5b70f2a61adf9b174061ce7f8239285f4417ec2a0416c8cd3f5d3f983f536eb89639056ff80ed93db1ca602cfd1bdff40cb3120c368eee771c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"e-9RhmhTndT299tL55DPwFi8cbbnl1xbHTNULh9wtNs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"j4kkYbjpyuHmknVf6YKmAoC-4Q-SyvkLmIvPR7FVuzI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HLksXda9SqKWR9j2I-yI02v7wxS3Hc88j2902CTqNXY\"}"
