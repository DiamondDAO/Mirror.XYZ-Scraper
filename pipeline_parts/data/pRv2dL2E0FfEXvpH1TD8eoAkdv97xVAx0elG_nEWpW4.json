The components are bought on their OpenSea marketplace, which consists of a cone, body and tail. Once constructed, the components used are burned and the completed rocket NFT is minted. Only 1,000 rockets can ever be assembled.\",\"timestamp\":1640189930,\"title\":\"Budweiser adopts .eth domain name.\"},\"digest\":\"PpR5q0PfXc-Z_lKsmSHUcmyfOyn9dbcZTw7XnPOZiH0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfE11FCADBeDf02aEAc11876f087CC1C77506AdD5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7Dr6aJ3mlkWxAjvX58HppB-NBMc26qT0TC9ll2Vu0Dc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NmND0TvVgVDImN57EZ-aF39nYJ8eI_uxMfakVRoPzKA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bpZhiMfG1DJwWh_3LZkzlIi_EFsFA5V3hJIECjKE8j9kBERvwjJ5e3vbvmKSMSbQxkgwIa-_M6LK_S_tLI570A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1a45110033fb865651416f38b56a338d625ad8f62dd3dcea548988826761b0a5200a87c7ba2c3d740f4a78a3ff075194d54c07260b3e706701fb749ea316d0f71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7Dr6aJ3mlkWxAjvX58HppB-NBMc26qT0TC9ll2Vu0Dc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NmND0TvVgVDImN57EZ-aF39nYJ8eI_uxMfakVRoPzKA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PpR5q0PfXc-Z_lKsmSHUcmyfOyn9dbcZTw7XnPOZiH0\"}"
