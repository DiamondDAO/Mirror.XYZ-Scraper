"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"little bird that in May, as it migrates northward to its nesting ground, darts in and out of the leafy shadows like a tongue of fire.\\n\\nIt is by far the most glorious of all the warblers -- a sort of diminutive oriole. The quiet-colored little mate flits about after him, apparently lost in admiration of his fine feathers and the ease with which his thin tenor voice can end his lover's warble in a high Z.\\n\\nTake a good look at this attractive couple, for in May they leave us to build a nest of bark and moss in the evergreens of Canada -- that paradise for warblers -- or of the Catskills and Adirondacks, and in autumn they hurry south to escape the first frosts.\\n\\nREDSTART (Setophaga ruticilla) Wood Warbler family\\n\\nCalled also: YELLOW-TAILED WARBLER; \\\\[AMERICAN REDSTART, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 5 to 5.5 inches. Male -- In spring plumage: Head, neck, back, and middle breast   glossy black, with blue reflections. Breast and underneath   white, slightly flushed with salmon, increasing to bright   salmon-orange on the sides of the body and on the wing linings.   Occasional specimens show orange-red. Tail feathers partly   black, partly orange, with broad black band across the end.   Orange markings on wings. Bill and feet black. In autumn:   Fading into rusty black, olive, and yellow. Female -- Olive-brown, and yellow where the male is orange. Young   browner than the females. Range -- North America to upper Canada. West occasionally, as far   as the Pacific coast, but commonly found in summer in the   Atlantic and Middle States. Migrations -- Early May. End of September. Summer resident.\\n\\nLate some evening, early in May, when one by one the birds have withdrawn their voices from the vesper chorus, listen for the lingering \\\"'tsee, 'tsee, 'tseet\\\" (usually twelve times repeated in a minute), that the redstart sweetly but rather monotonously sings from the evergreens, where, as his tiny body burns in the twilight, Mrs. Wright likens him to a \\\"wind-blown firebrand, half glowing, half charred.\\\"\\n\\nBut by daylight this brilliant little warbler is constantly on the alert. It is true he has the habit, like the flycatchers (among which some learned ornithologists still class him), of sitting pensively on a branch, with fluffy feathers and drooping wings; but the very next instant he shows true warbler blood by making a sudden dash upward, then downward through the air, tumbling somersaults, as if blown by the wind, flitting from branch to branch, busily snapping at the tiny insects hidden beneath the leaves, clinging to the tree-trunk like a creeper, and singing between bites.\\n\\nPossibly he will stop long enough in his mad chase to open and shut his tail, fan-fashion, with a dainty egotism that, in the peacock, becomes rank vanity.\\n\\nThe Germans call this little bird roth Stert (red tail), but, like so many popular names, this is a misnomer, as, strictly speaking, the redstart is never red, though its salmon-orange markings often border on to orange-flame.\\n\\nIn a fork of some tall bush or tree, placed ten or fifteen feet from the ground, a carefully constructed little nest is made of moss, horsehair, and strippings from the bark, against which the nest is built, the better to conceal its location. Four or five whitish eggs, thickly sprinkled with pale brown and lilac, like the other warblers', are too jealously guarded by the little mother-bird to be very often seen.\\n\\nBALTIMORE ORIOLE (Iderus galbula) Oriole and Blackbird family\\n\\nCalled also: GOLDEN ORIOLE;FIREBIRD; GOLDEN ROBIN; HANG-NEST;   ENGLISH ROBIN\\n\\nLength -- 7 to 8 inches. About one-fifth smaller than the robin. Male -- Head, throat, upper part of back glossy black. Wings   black, with white spots and edgings. Tail-quills black, with   yellow markings on the tips. Everywhere else orange, shading   into flame. Female -- Yellowish olive. Wings dark brown, and quills margined   with white. Tail yellowish brown, with obscure, dusky bars. Range -- The whole United States. Most numerous in Eastern States   below 55 degrees north latitude. Migrations -- Early May. Middle of September. Common summer   resident.\\n\\nA flash of fire through the air; a rich, high, whistled song floating in the wake of the feathered meteor: the Baltimore oriole cannot be mistaken. When the orchards are in blossom he arrives in full plumage and song, and awaits the coming of the female birds, that travel northward more leisurely in flocks. He is decidedly in evidence. No foliage is dense enough to hide his brilliancy; his temper, quite as fiery as his feathers, leads him into noisy quarrels, and his insistent song with its martial, interrogative notes becomes almost tiresome until he is happily mated and family cares check his enthusiasm.\\n\\nAmong the best architects in the world is his plain but energetic mate. Gracefully swung from a high branch of some tall tree, the nest is woven with exquisite skill into a long, flexible pouch that rain cannot penetrate, nor wind shake from its horsehair moorings. Bits of string, threads of silk, and sometimes yarn of the gayest colors, if laid about the shrubbery in the garden, will be quickly interwoven with the shreds of bark and milkweed stalks that the bird has found afield. The shape of the nest often differs, because in unsettled regions, where hawks abound, it is necessary to make it deeper than seven inches (the customary depth when it is built near the homes of men), and to partly close it at the top to conceal the sitting bird. From four to six whitish eggs, scrawled over with black-brown, are hatched by the mother oriole, and most jealously guarded by her now truly domesticated mate.\\n\\nThe number of grubs, worms, flies, caterpillars, and even cocoons, that go to satisfy the hunger of a family of orioles in a day, might indicate, if it could be computed, the great value these birds are about our homes, aside from the good cheer they bring.\\n\\nThere is a popular tradition about the naming of this gorgeous bird: When George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, worn out and discouraged by various hardships in his Newfoundland colony, decided to visit Virginia in 1628, he wrote that nothing in the Chesapeake country so impressed him as the myriads of birds in its woods. But the song and color of the oriole particularly cheered and delighted him, and orange and black became the heraldic colors of the first lords proprietors of Maryland.\\n\\n```\\n Hush! 'tis he! My Oriole, my glance of summer fire,      Is come at last; and ever on the watch,      Twitches the pack-thread I had lightly wound      About the bough to help his housekeeping.      Twitches and scouts by turns, blessing his luck,      Yet fearing me who laid it in his way.      Nor, more than wiser we in our affairs,      Divines the Providence that hides and helps.      Heave, ho! Heave, ho! he whistles as the twine      Slackens its hold; once more, now! and a flash      Lightens across the sunlight to the elm      Where his mate dangles at her cup of felt.                                         -- James Russell Lowell.\\n```\\n\\nBIRDS CONSPICUOUSLY RED OF ANY SHADE\\n\\nCardinal Grosbeak   Summer Tanager   Scarlet Tanager   Pine Grosbeak   American Crossbill and the White-winged Crossbill   Redpoll and Greater Redpoll   Purple Finch   Robin   Orchard Oriole\\n\\nSee the Red-winged Blackbird (Black).

A little smaller than the robin. Male -- Brilliant cardinal; chin and band around bill black. Beak   stout and red. Crest conspicuous. In winter dress, wings washed   with gray. Female -- Brownish yellow above, shading to gray below. Tail   shorter than the male's. Crest, wings, and tail reddish. Breast   sometimes tinged with red. Range -- Eastern United States. A Southern bird, becoming more   and more common during the summer in States north of Virginia,   especially in Ohio, south of which it is resident throughout   the year. Migrations --  Resident rather than migrating birds, remaining   throughout the winter in localities where they have found their   way. Travel in flocks.\\n\\nAmong the numerous names by which this beautiful bird is known, it has become immortalized under the title of Mr. James Lane Allen's exquisite book, \\\"The Kentucky Cardinal.\\\" Here, while we are given a most charmingly sympathetic, delicate account of the bird \\\"who has only to be seen or heard, and Death adjusts an arrow,\\\" it is the cardinal's pathetic fate that impresses one most. Seen through less poetical eyes, however, the bird appears to be a haughty autocrat, a sort of \\\"F. F. V.\\\" among the feathered tribes, as, indeed, his title, \\\"Virginia redbird,\\\" has been unkindly said to imply. Bearing himself with a refined and courtly dignity, not stooping to soil his feet by walking on the ground like the more democratic robin, or even condescending below the level of the laurel bushes, the cardinal is literally a shining example of self-conscious superiority -- a bird to call forth respect and admiration rather than affection. But a group of cardinals in a cedar tree in a snowy winter landscape makes us forgetful of everything but their supreme beauty.\\n\\nAs might be expected in one of the finch family, the cardinal is a songster -- the fact which, in connection with his lovely plumage, accounts for the number of these birds shipped in cages to Europe, where they are known as Virginia nightingales. Commencing with a strong, rich whistle, like the high notes of a fife, \\\"Cheo-cheo-cheo-cheo,\\\" repeated over and over as if to make perfect the start of a song he is about to sing, suddenly he stops, and you learn that there is to be no glorious performance after all, only a prelude to -- nothing. The song, such as it is, begins, with both male and female, in March, and lasts, with a brief intermission, until September -- \\\"the most melodious sigh,\\\" as Mr. Allen calls it. Early in May the cardinals build a bulky and loosely made nest, usually in the holly, laurel, or other evergreen shrubs that they always love to frequent, especially if these are near fields of corn or other grain. And often two broods in a year come forth from the pale-gray, brown-marked eggs, beating what is literally for them the \\\"fatal gift of beauty.\\\"\\n\\nSUMMER TANAGER (Piranga rubra) Tanager family\\n\\nCalled also: REDBIRD; SMOOTH-HEADED REDBIRD\\n\\nLength -- 7.5 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the robin. Male -- Uniform red. Wings and tail like the body. Female -- Upper parts yellowish olive-green; underneath inclining   to orange-yellow. Range -- Tropical portions of two Americas and eastern United   States. Most common in Southern States. Rare north of   Pennsylvania. Winters in the tropics. Mirations -- In Southern   States: April. October. Irregular migrant north of the   Carolinas.\\n\\nThirty years ago, it is recorded that so far north as New Jersey the summer redbird was quite as common as any of the thrushes. In the South still there is scarcely an orchard that does not contain this tropical-looking beauty -- the redbird par excellence, the sweetest singer of the family. Is there a more beautiful sight in all nature than a grove of orange trees laden with fruit, starred with their delicious blossoms, and with flocks of redbirds disporting themselves among the dark, glossy leaves? Pine and oak woods are also favorite resorts, especially at the north, where the bird nowadays forsakes the orchards to hide his beauty, if he can, unharmed by the rifle that only rarely is offered so shining a mark. He shows the scarlet tanager's preference for tree-tops, where his musical voice, calling \\\"Chicky-tucky-tuk,\\\" alone betrays his presence in the woods. The Southern farmers declare that he is an infallible weather prophet, his \\\"wet, WET, WET,\\\" being the certain indication of rain -- another absurd saw, for the call-note is by no means confined to the rainy season.\\n\\nThe yellowish-olive mate, whose quiet colors betray no nest secrets, collects twigs and grasses for the cradle to be saddled on the end of some horizontal branch, though in this work the male sometimes cautiously takes an insignificant part. After her three or four eggs are laid she sits upon them for nearly two weeks, being only rarely and stealthily visited by her mate with some choice grub, blossom, or berry in his beak. But how cheerfully his fife-like whistle rings out during the temporary exile! Then his song is at its best. Later in the summer he has an aggravating way of joining in the chorus of other birds' songs, by which the pleasant individuality of his own voice is lost.\\n\\nA nest of these tanagers, observed not far from New York City, was commenced the last week of May on the extreme edge of a hickory limb in an open wood; four eggs were laid on the fourth of June, and twelve days later the tiny fledglings, that all look like their mother in the early stages of their existence, burst from the greenish-white, speckled shells. In less than a month the young birds were able to fly quite well and collect their food.\\n\\nSCARLET TANAGER (Piranga erythromelas) Tanager family\\n\\nCalled also: BLACK-WINGED REDBIRD; FIREBIRD; CANADA TANAGER;   POCKET-BIRD\\n\\nLength -- 7 to 7.5 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the   robin. Male -- In spring plumage: Brilliant scarlet, with black wings   And tail. Under wing coverts grayish white. In autumn: Similar   To female. Female -- Olive-green above; wings and tail dark, lightly   Margined with olive. Underneath greenish yellow. Range -- North America to northern Canada boundaries, and   southwardin winter to South America. Migrations -- May. October. Summer resident\\n\\nThe gorgeous coloring of the scarlet tanager has been its snare and destruction. The densest evergreens could not altogether hide this blazing target for the sportsman's gun, too often fired at the instigation of city milliners. \\\"Fine feathers make fine birds\\\" -- and cruel, silly women, the adage might be adapted for latter-day use. This rarely beautiful tanager, thanks to them, is now only an infrequent flash of beauty in our country roads.\\n\\nInstinct leads it to be chary of its charms; and whereas it used to be one of the commonest of bird neighbors, it is now shy and solitary. An ideal resort for it is a grove of oak or swamp maple near a stream or pond where it can bathe. Evergreen trees, too, are favorites, possibly because the bird knows how exquisitely its bright scarlet coat is set off by their dark background.\\n\\nHigh in the tree-tops he perches, all unsuspected by the visitor passing through the woods below, until a burst of rich, sweet melody directs the opera-glasses suddenly upward. There we detect him carolling loud and cheerfully, like a robin. He is an apparition of beauty -- a veritable bird of paradise, as, indeed, he is sometimes called. Because of their similar coloring, the tanager and cardinal are sometimes confounded, but an instant's comparison of the two birds shows nothing in common except red feathers, and even those of quite different shades. The inconspicuous olive-green and yellow of the female tanager's plumage is another striking instance of Nature's unequal distribution of gifts; but if our bright-colored birds have become shockingly few under existing conditions, would any at all remain were the females prominent, like the males, as they brood upon the nest? Both tanagers construct a rather disorderly-looking nest of fibres and sticks, through which daylight can be seen where it rests securely upon the horizontal branch of some oak or pine tree; but as soon as three or four bluish-green eggs have been laid in the cradle, off goes the father, wearing his tell-tale coat, to a distant tree. There he sings his sweetest carol to the patient, brooding mate, returning to her side only long enough to feed her with the insects and berries that form their food.\\n\\nHappily for the young birds' fate, they are clothed at first in motley, dull colors, with here and there only a bright touch of scarlet, yellow, and olive to prove their claim to the parent whose gorgeous plumage must be their admiration. But after the moulting season it would be a wise tanager that knew its own father. His scarlet feathers are now replaced by an autumn coat of olive and yellow not unlike his mate's.\\n\\nPINE GROSBEAK (Pinicola enucleator) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: PINE BULLFINCH\\n\\nLength -- Variously recorded from 6.5 to 11 inches. Specimen   measured 8.5 inches. About one-fifth smaller than the robin. Male -- General color strawberry-red, with some slate-gray   fleckings about head, under wings, and on legs. Tail brown;   wings brown, marked with black and white and slate. A band-   shaped series of markings between the shoulders. Underneath   paler red, merging into grayish green. Heavy, conspicuous bill. Female -- Ash-brown. Head and hind neck yellowish brown, each   feather having central dusky streak. Cheeks and throat   yellowish. Beneath ash-gray, tinged with brownish yellow under   tail. Range -- British American provinces and northern United States. Migrations -- Irregular winter visitors; length of visits as   uncertain as their coming.\\n\\nAs inseparable as bees from flowers, so are these beautiful winter visitors from the evergreen woods, where their red feathers, shining against the dark-green background of the trees, give them charming prominence; but they also feed freely upon the buds of various deciduous trees.\\n\\nSouth of Canada we may not look for them except in the severest winter weather. Even then their coming is not to be positively depended upon; but when their caprice -- or was it an unusually fierce northern blast? -- sends them over the Canada border, it is a simple matter to identify them when such brilliant birds are rare. The brownish-yellow and grayish females and young males, however, always seem to be in the majority with us, though our Canadian friends assure us of the irreproachable morals of this gay bird.\\n\\nWherever there are clusters of pine or cedar trees, when there is a flock of pine grosbeaks in the neighborhood, you may expect to find a pair of birds diligently feeding upon the seeds and berries. No cheerful note escapes them as they persistently gormandize, and, if the truth must be confessed, they appear to be rather stupid and uninteresting, albeit they visit us at a time when we are most inclined to rapture over our bird visitors. They are said to have a deliciously sweet song in the nesting season. When, however, few except the Canadian voyageurs hear it.\\n\\nAMERICAN CROSSBILL (Loxia curvirostra minor) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: RED CROSSBILL \\\\[AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 6 to 7 inches. About the size of the English sparrow. Male -- General color Indian red, passing into brownish gray,   with red tinge beneath. Wings (without bands), also tail,   brown, Beak crossed at the tip. Female -- General color greenish yellow, with brownish tints.   Dull-yellowish tints on head, throat, breast, and underneath.   Wings and tail pale brown. Beak crossed at tip. Range -- Pennsylvania to northern British America. West of   Mississippi, range more southerly. Migrations -- Irregular winter visitor. November. Sometimes   resident until April.\\n\\nIt is a rash statement to say that a bird is rare simply because you have never seen it in your neighborhood, for while you are going out of the front door your rara avis may be eating the crumbs about your kitchen. Even with our eyes and ears constantly alert for some fresh bird excitement, our phlegmatic neighbor over the way may be enjoying a visit from a whole flock of the very bird we have been looking and listening for in vain all the year. The red crossbills are capricious little visitors, it is true, but by no means uncommon.\\n\\nAbout the size of an English sparrow, of a brick or Indian red color, for the most part, the peculiarity of its parrot-like beak is its certain mark of identification.\\n\\nLongfellow has rendered into verse the German legend of the crossbill, which tells that as the Saviour hung upon the cross, a little bird tried to pull out the nails that pierced His hands and feet, thus twisting its beak and staining its feathers with the blood.\\n\\nAt first glance the birds would seem to be hampered by their crossed beaks in getting at the seeds in the pine cones -- a superficial criticism when the thoroughness and admirable dexterity of their work are better understood.\\n\\nVarious seeds of fruits, berries, and the buds of trees enlarge their bill of fare. They are said to be inordinately fond of salt. Mr. Romeyn B. Hough tells of a certain old ice-cream freezer that attracted flocks of crossbills one winter, as a salt-lick attracts deer. Whether the traditional salt that may have stuck to the bird's tail is responsible for its tameness is not related, but it is certain the crossbills, like most bird visitors from the far north, are remarkably gentle, friendly little birds. As they swing about the pine trees, parrot-fashion, with the help of their bill, calling out kimp, kimp, that sounds like the snapping of the pine cones on a sunny day, it often seems easily possible to catch them with the hand.\\n\\nThere is another species of crossbill, called the White-winged (Loxia leucoptera), that differs from the preceding chiefly in having two white bands across its wings and in being more rare.\\n\\nTHE REDPOLL (Acanthis linaria) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: REDPOLL LINNET; LITTLE SNOWBIRD; LESSER REDPOLL;   \\\\[COMMON REDPOLL, AOU 1998\\\\]\\n\\nLength -- 5.25 to 5.5 inches. About an inch shorter than the   English sparrow. Male -- A rich crimson wash on head, neck, breast, and lower   back, that is sometimes only a pink when we see the bird in   midwinter. Grayish-brown, sparrowy feathers show underneath the   red wash. Dusky wings and tail, the feathers more or less edged   with whitish. Soiled white underneath; the sides with dusky   streaks. Bill sharply pointed. Female -- More dingy than male, sides more heavily streaked, and   having crimson only on the crown. Range -- An arctic bird that descends irregularly into the   Northern United States. Migrations -- An irregular winter visitor.\\n\\n\\\"Ere long, amid the cold and powdery snow, as it were a fruit of the season, will come twittering a flock of delicate crimson-tinged birds, lesser redpolls, to sport and feed on the buds just ripe for them on the sunny side of a wood, shaking down the powdery snow there in their cheerful feeding, as if it were high midsummer to them.\\\" Thoreau's beautiful description of these tiny winter visitors, which should be read entire, shows the man in one of his most sympathetic, exalted moods, and it is the best brief characterization of the redpoll that we have.\\n\\nWhen the arctic cold becomes too cruel for even the snow-birds and crossbills to withstand, flocks of the sociable little redpolls flying southward are the merest specks in the sullen, gray sky, when they can be seen at all. So high do they keep that often they must pass above our heads without our knowing it. First we see a quantity of tiny dots, like a shake of pepper, in the cloud above, then the specks grow larger and larger, and finally the birds seem to drop from the sky upon some tall tree that they completely cover -- a veritable cloudburst of birds. Without pausing to rest after the long journey, down they flutter into the weedy pastures with much cheerful twittering, to feed upon whatever seeds may be protruding through the snow. Every action of a flock seems to be concerted, as if some rigid disciplinarian had drilled them, and yet no leader can be distinguished in the merry company. When one flies, all fly; where one feeds, all feed, and by some subtle telepathy all rise at the identical instant from their feeding ground and cheerfully twitter in concert where they all alight at once. They are more easily disturbed than the goldfinches, that are often seen feeding with them in the lowlands; nevertheless, they quite often venture into our gardens and orchards, even in suburbs penetrated by the trolley-car.\\n\\nUsually in winter we hear only their lisping call-note; but if the birds linger late enough in the spring, when their \\\"fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love,\\\" a gleeful, canary-like song comes from the naked branches, and we may know by it that the flock will soon disappear for their nesting grounds in the northern forests.\\n\\nThe Greater Redpoll (Acanthis linaria rostrata) may be distinguished from the foregoing species by its slightly larger size, darker upper parts, and shorter, stouter bill. But the notes, habits, and general appearance of both redpolls are so nearly identical that the birds are usually mistaken for each other.\\n\\nPURPLE FINCH (Carpodacus purpureus) Finch family\\n\\nCalled also: PURPLE LINNET\\n\\nLength -- 6 to 6.25 inches. About the same size as the English   sparrow. Male -- Until two years old, sparrow-like in appearance like the   female, but with olive-yellow on chin and lower back.   Afterwards entire body suffused with a bright raspberry-red,   deepest on head, lower back, and breast, and other parts only   faintly washed with this color. More brown on back; and wings   and tail, which are dusky, have some reddish brown feathers.   Underneath grayish white. Bill heavy. Tail forked. Female -- Grayish olive brown above; whitish below; finely   Streaked everywhere with very dark brown, like a sparrow. Sides   of breast have arrow-shaped marks. Wings and tail darkest. Range -- North America, from Columbia River eastward to Atlantic   and from Mexico northward to Manitoba. Most common in Middle   States and New England. Winters south of Pennsylvania. Migrations -- March. November. Common summer resident. Rarely   individuals winter at the north.\\n\\nIn this \\\"much be-sparrowed country\\\" of ours familiarity is apt to breed contempt for any bird that looks sparrowy, in which case one of the most delicious songsters we have might easily be overlooked. It is not until the purple finch reaches maturity in his second year that his plumage takes on the raspberry-red tints that some ornithologists named purple. Oriental purple is our magenta, it is true, but not a raspberry shade. Before maturity, but for the yellow on his lower back and throat, he and his mate alike suggest a song-sparrow; and it is important to note their particularly heavy, rounded bills, with the tufts of feathers at the base, and their forked tails, to name them correctly. But the identification of the purple finch, after all, depends quite as much upon his song as his color. In March, when flocks of these birds come north, he has begun to sing a little; by the beginning of May he is desperately in love, and sudden, joyous peals of music from the elm or evergreen trees on the lawn enliven the garden. How could his little brown lady-love fail to be impressed with a suitor so gayly dressed, so tender and solicitous, so deliciously sweet-voiced? With fuller, richer song than the warbling vireo's, which Nuttall has said it resembles, a perfect ecstasy of love, pours incessantly from his throat during the early summer days. There is a suggestion of the robins love-song in his, but its copiousness, variety, and rapidity give it a character all its own.\\n\\nIn some old, neglected hedge or low tree about the countryplace a flat, grassy nest, lined with horsehair, contains four or five green eggs in June, and the old birds are devotion itself to each other, and soon to their young, sparrowy brood.\\n\\nBut when parental duties are over, the finches leave our lawns and gardens to join flocks of their own kind in more remote orchards or woods, their favorite haunts. Their subdued warble may be heard during October and later, as if the birds were humming to themselves.\\n\\nMuch is said of their fondness for fruit blossoms and tree buds, but the truth is that noxious insects and seeds of grain constitute their food in summer, the berries of evergreens in winter. To a bird so gay of color, charming of voice, social, and trustful of disposition, surely a few blossoms might be spared without grudging.\\n\\nTHE AMERICAN ROBIN (Merula migratoria) Thrush family\\n\\nCalled also: RED-BREASTED OR MIGRATORY THRUSH; ROBIN-REDBREAST\\n\\nLength -- 10 inches. Male -- Dull brownish olive-gray above. Head black; tail brownish   black, with exterior feathers white at inner tip. Wings dark   brownish. Throat streaked with black and white. White eyelids.   Entire breast bright rusty red; whitish below the tail. Female -- Duller and with paler breast, resembling the male in   autumn. Range -- North America, from Mexico to arctic regions. Migrations -- March. October or November. Often resident   throughout the year.\\n\\nIt seems almost superfluous to write a line of description about a bird that is as familiar as a chicken; yet how can this nearest of our bird neighbors be passed without a reference? Probably he was the very first bird we learned to call by name.\\n\\nThe early English colonists, who had doubtless been brought up, like the rest of us, on \\\"The Babes in the Wood,\\\" named the bird after the only heroes in that melancholy tale; but in reality the American robin is a much larger bird than the English  robin-redbreast and less brilliantly colored. John Burroughs calls him, of all our birds, \\\"the most native and democratic.\\\"\\n\\nHow the robin dominates birddom with his strong, aggressive personality! His voice rings out strong and clear in the early morning chorus, and, more tenderly subdued at twilight, it still rises above all the sleepy notes about him. Whether lightly tripping over the lawn after the \\\"early worm,\\\" or rising with his sharp, quick cry of alarm, when startled, to his nest near by, every motion is decided, alert, and free. No pensive hermit of the woods, like his cousins, the thrushes, is this joyous vigorous \\\"bird of the morning.\\\" Such a presence is inspiriting.\\n\\nDoes any bird excel the robin in the great variety of his vocal expressions? Mr. Parkhurst, in his charming \\\"Birds' Calendar,\\\" says he knows of \\\"no other bird that is able to give so many shades of meaning to a single note, running through the entire gamut of its possible feelings. From the soft and mellow quality, almost as coaxing as a dove's note, with which it encourages its young when just out of the nest, the tone, with minute gradations, becomes more vehement, and then harsh and with quickened reiteration, until it expresses the greatest intensity of a bird's emotions. Love, contentment, anxiety, exultation, rage -- what other bird can throw such multifarious meaning into its tone? And herein the robin seems more nearly human than any of its kind.\\\"\\n\\nThere is no one thing that attracts more birds about the house that a drinking-dish -- large enough for a bathtub as well; and certainly no bird delights in sprinkling the water over his back more than a robin, often aided in his ablutions by the spattering of the sparrows. But see to it that this drinking-dish is well raised above the reach of lurking cats.\\n\\nWhile the robin is a famous splasher, his neatness stops there. A robin's nest is notoriously dirty within, and so carelessly constructed of weed-stalks, grass, and mud, that a heavy summer shower brings more robins' nests to the ground than we like to contemplate. The color of the eggs, as every one knows, has given their name to the tint. Four is the number of eggs laid, and two broods are often reared in the same nest.\\n\\nToo much stress is laid on the mischief done by the robins in the cherry trees and strawberry patches, and too little upon the quantity of worms and insects they devour. Professor Treadwell, who experimented upon some young robins kept in captivity, learned that they ate sixty-eight earthworms daily -- \\\"that is, each bird ate forty-one per cent more than its own weight in twelve hours! The length of these worms, if laid end to end, would be about fourteen feet. Man, at this rate, would eat about seventy pounds of flesh a day, and drink five or six gallons of water.\\\"\\n\\nORCHARD ORIOLE (Icterus spurius) Blackbird and Oriole family\\n\\nCalled also: ORCHARD STARLING; ORCHARD HANG-NEST\\n\\nLength -- 7 to 7.3 inches. About one-fourth smaller than the   robin. Male -- Head, throat, upper back, tail, and part of wings black.   Breast, rump, shoulders, under wing and tail coverts, and under   parts bright reddish brown. Whitish-yellow markings on a few   tail and wing feathers. Female -- Head and upper parts olive, shading into brown;   brighter on head and near tail. Back and wings dusky brown,   with pale-buff shoulder-bars and edges of coverts. Throat   black. Under parts olive, shading into yellow. Range -- Canada to Central America. Common in temperate latitudes   of the United States. Migrations -- Early May. Middle of September. Common summer   resident.\\n\\nWith a more southerly range than the Baltimore oriole and less conspicuous coloring, the orchard oriole is not so familiar a bird in many Northern States, where, nevertheless, it is quite common enough to be classed among our would-be intimates. The orchard is not always as close, to the house as this bird cares to venture; he will pursue an insect even to the piazza vines.\\n\\nHis song, says John Burroughs, is like scarlet, \\\"strong, intense, emphatic,\\\" but it is sweet and is more rapidly uttered than that of others of the family. It is ended for the season early in July.\\n\\nThis oriole, too, builds a beautiful nest, not often pendent like the Baltimore's, but securely placed in the fork of a sturdy fruit tree, at a moderate height, and woven with skill and precision, like a basket. When the dried grasses from one of these nests were stretched and measured, all were found to be very nearly the same length, showing to what pains the little weaver had gone to make the nest neat and pliable, yet strong. Four cloudy-white eggs with dark-brown spots are usually found in the nest in June.\",\"timestamp\":1641275185,\"title\":\"No foliage is dense enough to hide, and no autumnal tint too brilliant to outshine this luminous\"},\"digest\":\"4H_mHwBDBfA8ONG9OkR-mRyDMbFSj7b359Ks6zRAYnE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9DC92730677fd3244eD267F4e8bDd94201A144f8\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6NK4XqAX0BkZ9Pkv88SUsnH_FMrwkvatYLbOXBgnn1I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i7jKnRanEkm0EvqQgfV7GozuW4SssaGhgasOcjtBzWA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XB0ckDTORHb_bi_Cl4sUJVhIrbX2cGoqyUxYlhKY0gl7JLrwVRnoDqGYcS2RZV9_9Oaf0K_oxZtc7VfjleOssg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6747e12bae4c197d5ec9425012a2cf4398fae2af4da9b4d9256f4d5a5426f9e81b474cf31a879e3deefd3992ca02af66cf5b82c24f9455f3a1f2c1143fe1cfaa1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6NK4XqAX0BkZ9Pkv88SUsnH_FMrwkvatYLbOXBgnn1I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i7jKnRanEkm0EvqQgfV7GozuW4SssaGhgasOcjtBzWA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4H_mHwBDBfA8ONG9OkR-mRyDMbFSj7b359Ks6zRAYnE\"}"
