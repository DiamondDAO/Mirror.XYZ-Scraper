"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"replied Cortlandt; \\\"but you\\nmust remember that both those qualities would be given it by\\ncarbonic-acid gas, which is entirely invisible and transparent.\\nNo gas that would be likely to remain in the air would interfere\\nwith sight; water vapour is the only thing that could; and though\\nthe crust of this planet, even near the surface, is still hot,\\nthe sun being so distant, the vapour would not be, raised much.\\nBy avoiding low places near hot springs, we shall doubtless have\\nvery nearly as clear an atmosphere as on earth.  What does\\nsurprise me is the ease with which we breathe.  I can account for\\nit only by supposing that, the Carboniferous period being already\\nwell advanced, most of the carbonic acid is already locked up in\\nthe forests or in Jupiter's coal-beds.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How, asked Bearwarden, \\\"do you account for the 'great red spot'\\nthat appeared here in 1878, lasted several years, and then\\ngradually faded?  It was taken as unmistakable evidence that\\nJupiter's atmosphere was filled with impenetrable banks of cloud.\\nIn fact, you remember many of the old books said we had probably\\nnever seen the surface.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That has puzzled me very much,\\\" replied Cortlandt, \\\"but I never\\nbelieved the explanation then given was correct.  The\\nCarboniferous period is essentially one of  great forest growth;\\nso there would be nothing out of the way in supposing the spot,\\nnotwithstanding its length of twenty-seven thousand miles and its\\nbreadth of eight thousand miles, to have been forest.  It\\noccurred in what would correspond to the temperate region on\\nearth.  Now, though the axis of this planet is practically\\nstraight, the winds of course change their direction, and so the\\ntemperature does vary from day to day.  What is more probable\\nthan that, owing perhaps to a prolonged norther or cold spell, a\\nlong strip of forest lying near the frost line was brought a few\\ndegrees below it, so that the leaves changed their colours as\\nthey do on earth?  It would, it seems to me, be enough to give\\nthe surface a distinct colour; and the fact that the spot's\\ngreatest length was east and west, or along the lines of\\nlatitude, so that the whole of that region might have been\\nexposed to the same conditions of temperature, strengthens this\\nhypothesis.  The strongest objection is, that the spot is said to\\nhave moved; but the motion--five seconds--was so slight that it\\nmight easily have been an error in observation, or the first area\\naffected by the cold may have been enlarged on one side.  It\\nseems to me that the stability the spot DID have would make the\\ncloud theory impossible on earth, and much more so here, with the\\nfar more rapid rotation and more violent winds.  It may also have\\nbeen a cloud of smoke from a volcano in eruption, such as we saw\\non our arrival, though it is doubtful whether in that case it\\nwould have remained nearly stationary while going through its\\ngreatest intensity and fading, which would look as though the\\nturned leaves had fallen off and been gradually replaced by new\\nones; and, in addition to this, the spot since it was first\\nnoticed has never entirely disappeared, which might mean a\\nvolcanic region constantly emitting smoke, or that the surface,\\ndoubtless from some covering whose colour can change, is normally\\nof a different shade from the surrounding region.  In any case,\\nwe have as yet seen nothing that would indicate a permanently\\nclouded atmosphere.\\\"\\n\\nThough they had walked a considerable distance, the water was not\\nmuch cooled; and though the stream's descent was so slight that\\non earth its current would have been very slow, here it rushed\\nalong like a mountain torrent, the reason, of course, being that\\na given amount of water on Jupiter would depress a spring balance\\n2\\\\.55 times as much as on the earth.\\n\\n\\\"It is strange,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"that, notwithstanding its great\\nspeed, the water remains so hot; you would think its motion would\\ncool it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So it does,\\\" answered the professor.  \\\"It of course cools\\nconsiderably more in a given period--as, for instance, one\\nminute--than if it were moving more slowly, but on account of its\\nspeed it has been exposed to the air but a very short time since\\nleaving the spring.\\\"\\n\\nJust before them the stream now widened into a narrow lake, which\\nthey could see was straight for some distance.\\n\\n\\\"The fact is,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"this water seems in such haste\\nto reach the ocean that it turns neither to right nor to left,\\nand does not even seem to wish to widen out.\\\"\\n\\nAs the huge ferns and palms grew to the water's edge, they\\nconcluded the best way to traverse the lake would be on a raft.\\nAccordingly, choosing a large overhanging palm, Bearwarden and\\nAyrault fired each an explosive ball into its trunk, about\\neighteen inches from the ground.  One round was enough to put it\\nin the water, each explosion removing several cubic feet of wood.\\nBy repeating this process on other trees they soon had enough\\nlarge timber for buoyancy, so that they had but to superimpose\\nlighter cross-logs and bind the whole together with pliable\\nbranches and creepers to form a substantial raft.  The doctor\\nclimbed on, after which Bearwarden and Ayrault cast off, having\\nprepared long poles for navigating.  With a little care they kept\\ntheir bark from catching on projecting roots, and as the stream\\ncontinued to widen till it was about one hundred yards across,\\ntheir work became easy.  Carried along at a speed of two or three\\nmiles an hour, they now saw that the water and the banks they\\npassed were literally alive with reptiles and all sorts of\\namphibious creatures, while winged lizards sailed from every\\noverhanging branch into the water as they approached.  They\\nnoticed also many birds similar to storks and cranes, about the\\nsize of ostriches, standing on logs in the water, whose bills\\nwere provided with teeth.\\n\\n\\\"We might almost think we were on earth,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"from the\\nlooks of those storks standing on one leg, with the other drawn\\nup, were it not for their size.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How do you suppose they defend themselves,\\\" asked Bearwarden,\\n\\\"from the snakes with which the water is filled?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suspect they can give a pretty good account of themselves,\\\"\\nreplied Cortlandt, \\\"with those teeth.  Besides, with only one leg\\nexposed, there is but a very small object for a snake to strike\\nat.  For their number and size, I should say their struggle for\\nexistence was comparatively mild.  Doubtless non-poisonous, or,\\nfor that matter, poisonous snakes, form a great part of their\\ndiet.\\\"\\n\\nOn passing the bend in the lake they noticed that the banks were\\nslightly higher, while palms, pine-trees, and rubber plants\\nsucceeded the ferns.  In the distance they now heard a tremendous\\ncrashing, which grew louder as the seconds passed.  It finally\\nsounded like an earthquake.  Involuntarily they held their breath\\nand grasped their weapons.  Finally, at some distance in the\\nwoods they saw a dark mass moving rapidly and approaching the\\nriver obliquely.  Palms and pine-trees went down before it like\\nstraws, while its head was continually among the upper branches.\\nAs the monster neared the lake, the water at the edges quivered,\\nshowing how its weight shook the banks at each stride, while\\nstumps and tree-trunks on which it stepped were pressed out of\\nsight in the ground.  A general exodus of the other inhabitants\\nfrom his line of march began; the moccasins slid into the water\\nwith a low splash, while the boa-constrictors and the tree-snakes\\nmoved off along the ground when they felt it tremble, and a\\nnumber of night birds retreated into the denser woods with loud\\ncries at being so rudely disturbed.  The huge beast did not stop\\ntill he reached the bank, where lie switched his tail, raised his\\nproboscis, and sniffed the air uneasily, his height being fully\\nthirty feet and his length about fifty.  On seeing the raft and\\nits occupants, he looked at them stupidly and threw back his\\nhead.\\n\\n\\\"He seems to be turning up his nose at us,\\\" said Bearwarden.\\n\\\"All the same, he will do well for breakfast.\\\"\\n\\nAs the creature moved, his chest struck a huge overhanging palm,\\ntearing it off as though it had been a reed.  Brushing it aside\\nwith his trunk, he was about to continue his march, when two\\nrifle reports rang out together, rousing the echoes and a number\\nof birds that screeched loudly.\\n\\n```\\n                       CHAPTER VI.\\n\\n             MASTODON AND WILL-O'-THE WISPS.\\n```\\n\\nBearwarden's bullet struck the mammoth in the shoulder, while\\nAyrault's aim was farther back.  As the balls exploded, a\\nhalf-barrelful of flesh and hide was shot from each, leaving two\\ngaping holes.  Instantly he rushed among the trees, making his\\ncourse known for some time by his roars.  As he turned,\\nBearwarden fired again, but the hall flew over him, blowing off\\nthe top of a tree.\\n\\n\\\"Now for the chase!\\\" said Ayrault.  \\\"There would be no excuse for\\nlosing him.\\\"\\n\\nQuickly pushing their raft to shore and securing it to the bank,\\nthe three jumped off.  Thanks to their rubber boots and galvanic\\noutfits which automatically kept them charged, they were as spry\\nas they would have been on earth.  The ground all about them, and\\nin a strip twelve feet wide where the mammoth had gone, was torn\\nup, and the vegetation trodden down.  Following this trail, they\\nstruck back into the woods, where in places the gloom cast by the\\nthick foliage was so dense that there was a mere twilight,\\nstartling as they went numbers of birds of grey and sombre\\nplumage, whose necks and heads, and the sounds they uttered, were\\nso reptilian that the three terrestrials believed they must also\\npossess poison fangs.\\n\\n\\\"The most highly developed things we have seen here,\\\" said\\nBearwarden, \\\"are the flowers and fireflies, most of the birds and\\namphibians being simply loathsome.\\\"\\n\\nAs they proceeded they found tracks of blood, which were rapidly\\nattracting swarms of the reptile birds and snakes, which,\\nhowever, as a rule, fled at their approach.\\n\\n\\\"I wonder what can have caused that mammoth to move so fast, and\\nto have seemed so ill at ease?\\\" said the doctor.  \\\"His motive\\ncertainly was not thirst, for he did not approach the water in a\\ndirect line, neither did he drink on reaching it.  One would\\nthink nothing short of an earthquake or a land-slide could\\ntrouble him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There can be no land-slide here,\\\" said Ayrault, for the country\\nis too flat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And after yesterday's eruptions,\\\" added Bearwarden, \\\"it would\\nseem as though the volcanoes could have scarcely enough steam\\nleft to make trouble.\\\"\\n\\nThe blood-tracks, continuing to become fresher, showed them they\\nwere nearing the game, when suddenly the trail took a sharp turn\\nto the right, even returning towards the lake.  A little farther\\nit took another sharp turn, then followed a series of doublings,\\nwhile still farther the ground was completely denuded of trees,\\nits torn-up and trampled condition and the enormous amount of\\nstill warm blood showing how terrific a battle had just taken\\nplace.\\n\\nWhile they looked about they saw what appeared to be the trunk of\\na tree about four feet in diameter and six feet long, with a\\nslight crook.  On coming closer, they recognized in it one of the\\nforefeet of the mammoth, cut as cleanly as though with a knife\\nfrom the leg just above the ankle, and still warm.  A little\\nfarther they found the huge trunk cut to slivers, and, just\\nbeyond, the body of the unfortunate beast with three of its feet\\ngone, and the thick hide cut and slashed like so much paper.  It\\nstill breathed, and Ayrault, who had a tender heart, sent an\\nexplosive ball into its skull, which ended its suffering.\\n\\nThe three hunters then surveyed the scene.  The largest and most\\npowerful beast they had believed could exist lay before them\\ndead, not from the bite of a snake or any other poison, but from\\nmechanical injuries of which those they had inflicted formed but\\na very small part, and literally cut to pieces.\\n\\n\\\"I am curious to see the animal,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"capable of\\ndoing this, though nothing short of dynamite bombs would protect\\nus from him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As he has not stopped to eat his victim,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"it\\nis fair to suppose he is not carnivorous, and so must have had\\nsome other motive than hunger in making the attack; unless we can\\nsuppose that our approach frightened him away, which, with such\\npower as he must possess, seems unlikely.  Let us see,\\\" he\\ncontinued, \\\"parts of two legs remain unaccounted for.  Perhaps,\\non account of their shape, he has been able the more easily to\\ncarry or roll them off, for we know that elephant foot makes a\\ncapital dish.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"From the way you talk,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"one would suppose you\\nattributed this to men.  The Goliath we picture to ourselves\\nwould be a child compared to the man that could cut through these\\nlegs, though the necessity of believing him to have merely great\\nsize does not disprove his existence here.  I think it probable\\nwe shall find this is the work of some animal with incisors of\\nsuch power as it is difficult for us to conceive of.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is no indication here of teeth,\\\" said Bearwarden, \\\"each\\nfoot being taken off with a clean cut.  Besides, we are coming to\\nbelieve that man existed on earth during the greater part, if not\\nthe whole, of our Carboniferous period.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We must reserve our decision pending further evidence,\\\" said\\nCortlandt.\\n\\n\\\"I vote we take the heart,\\\" said Ayrault, \\\"and cook it, since\\notherwise the mammoth will be devoured before our eyes.\\\"\\n\\nWhile Bearwarden and Ayrault delved for this, Cortlandt, with\\nsome difficulty, parted the mammoth's lips and examined the\\nteeth.  \\\"From the conical projections on the molars,\\\" said he,\\n\\\"this should be classed rather as a mastodon than as a mammoth.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the huge heart was secured, Bearwarden arranged slices on\\nsharpened sticks, while Ayrault set about starting a fire.  He\\nhad to use Cortlandt's gun to clear the dry wood of snakes,\\nwhich, attracted doubtless by the dead mastodon, came in such\\nnumbers that they covered the ground, while huge pterodactyls,\\nmore venomous-looking than the reptiles, hovered about the\\nopening above.\\n\\nArranging a double line of electric wires in a circle about the\\nmastodon and themselves, they sat down and did justice to the\\nmeal, with appetites that might have dismayed the waiting throng.\\nWhenever a snake's head came in contact with one wire, while his\\ntail touched the other, he gave a spasmodic leap and fell back\\ndead.  If he happened to fall across the wires, lie immediately\\nbegan to sizzle, a cloud of smoke arose, and lie was reduced to\\nashes.\\n\\n\\\"Any time that we are short of mastodon or other good game,\\\" said\\nAyrault, \\\"we need not hunger if we are not above grilled snake.\\\"\\n\\nAll laughed at this, and Bearwarden, drawing a whiskey-flask from\\nhis pocket, passed it to his friends.\\n\\n\\\"When we rig our fishing-tackle,\\\" he continued, \\\"and have fresh\\nfish for dinner, an entree of rattlesnake, roast mastodon for the\\npiece de resistance, and begin the whole with turtle soup and\\nclams, of which there must be plenty on the ocean beach, we shall\\nwant to stay here the rest of our lives.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suspect we shall have to,\\\" replied Ayrault \\\"for we shall\\nbecome so like Thanksgiving turkeys that the Callisto's door will\\nbe too small for us.\\\"\\n\\nWhile they sat and talked, the flowers and plants about them\\nsoftly began their song, and, as a visual accompaniment, the\\nfire-flies they had not before noticed twinkled through the\\nforest.\\n\\n\\\"My goodness! \\\" exclaimed Cortlandt, \\\"how time goes here!  We\\nstarted to get breakfast, and now it's growing dark.\\\"\\n\\nHastily cutting some thick but tender slices from the mastodon,\\nand impaling them with the remains of the heart on a sharpened\\nstake, they took up the wires, and the battery that had been\\nsupplying the current, and retraced their steps by the way they\\nhad come.  Their rubber-lined cowhide boots protected them from\\nall but the largest snakes, and as these were for the most part\\nalready enjoying their gorge, they trampled with impunity on\\nthose that remained in their path.  When they had covered about\\nhalf the distance to the raft, a huge boa-constrictor, which they\\nhad mistaken for a branch, fell upon Cortlandt, pinioning his\\narms and bearing him to the ground.  Dropping their loads,\\nBearwarden and Ayrault threw themselves upon the monster with\\ntheir hunting-knives with such vim that in a few seconds it beat\\na hasty retreat, leaving, as it did so, a wake of phosphorescent\\nlight.\\n\\n\\\"Are you hurt?\\\" asked Bearwarden, helping him up.\\n\\n\\\"Not in the least,\\\" replied Cortlandt.  \\\"What surprises me is\\nthat I am not.  The weight of that boa-constrictor would be very\\ngreat on earth, and here I should think it would be simply\\ncrushing.\\\"\\n\\nGroping their way through the rapidly growing darkness, they\\nreached the raft without further adventure, and, once on the\\nlake, had plenty of light.  Two moons, one at three quarters and\\nthe other full, shone brightly, while the water was alive with\\ngymnotuses and other luminous creatures.  Sitting and living upon\\nthe cross-timbers, they looked up at the sky.  The Great Bear and\\nthe north star had exactly the same relation to each other as\\nwhen seen from the earth, while the other constellations and the\\nMilky Way looked identically as when they had so often gazed at\\nthem before, and some idea of the immensity of space was conveyed\\nto them.  Here was no change; though they had travelled three\\nhundred and eighty million miles, there was no more perceptible\\ndifference than if they had not moved a foot.  Perhaps, they\\nthought, to the telescopes--if there are any--among the stars,\\nthe sun was seen to be accompanied by two small, dark companions,\\nfor Jupiter and Saturn might be visible, or perhaps it seemed\\nmerely as a slightly variable star, in years when sun-spots were\\nnumerous, or as the larger planets in their revolutions\\noccasionally intercepted a part of its light.  As they floated\\nalong they noticed a number of what they took to be\\nWill-o'-the-wisps.  Several of these great globules of pale flame\\nhovered about them in the air, near the surface of the water, and\\nanon they rose till they hung above the trees, apparently having\\nno forward or horizontal motion except when taken by the gentle\\nbreeze, merely sinking and rising.\\n\\n\\\"How pretty they are!\\\" said Cortlandt, as they watched them.\\n\\\"For bodies consisting of marsh gas, they hold together\\nwonderfully.\\\"\\n\\nPresently one alighted on the water near them.  It was\\nconsiderably brighter than any glow-worm, and somewhat larger\\nthan an arc lamp, being nearly three feet in diameter; it did not\\nemit much light, but would itself have been visible from a\\nconsiderable distance.  Cortlandt tried to touch it with a\\nraft-pole, but could not reach far enough.  Presently a large\\nfish approached it, swimming near the surface of the water.  When\\nit was close to the Jack-o'-lantern, or whatever it was, there\\nwas a splash, the fish turned up its white under side, and, the\\nbreeze being away from the raft, the fire-ball and its victim\\nslowly floated off together.  There were frequently a dozen of\\nthese great globules in sight at once, rising and descending, the\\nobservers noticing one peculiarity, viz., that their brightness\\nincreased as they rose, and decreased as they sank.\\n\\nAbout two and a half hours after sunset, or midnight according to\\nJupiter time, they fell asleep, but about an hour later Cortlandt\\nwas awakened by a weight on his chest.  Starting up, he perceived\\na huge white-faced bat, with its head but a few inches from his.\\nIts outstretched wings were about eight feet across, and it\\nfastened its sharp claws upon him.  Seizing it by the throat, he\\nstruggled violently.  His companions, awakened by the noise,\\nquickly came to his rescue, grasping him just as he was in danger\\nof being dragged off the raft, and in another moment Bearwarden's\\nknife had entered the creature's spine.\\n\\n\\\"This evidently belongs to the blood-sucking species,\\\" said\\nCortlandt.  \\\"I seem to be the target for all these beasts, and\\nhenceforth shall keep my eyes open at night.\\\"\\n\\nAs day would break in but little over an hour, they decided to\\nremain awake, and they pushed the dead bat overboard, where it\\nwas soon devoured by fishes.  A chill had come upon the air, and\\nthe incessant noise of the forms of life about them had in a\\nmeasure ceased.\\n\\nCortlandt passed around a box of quinine as a preventive against\\nmalaria, and again they lay back and looked at the stars.  The\\nmost splendid sight in their sky now was Saturn.  At the\\ncomparatively short distance this great planet was from them, it\\ncast a distinct shadow, its vast rings making it appear twice its\\nreal size.  With the first glimmer of dawn, the fire-balls\\ndescended to the surface of the water and disappeared within it,\\ntheir lights going out.  With a suddenness to which the explorers\\nwere becoming accustomed, the sun burst upon them, rising as\\nperpendicularly as at the earth's equator, and more than twice as\\nfast, having first tinged the sky with the most brilliant hues.\\n\\nThe stream had left the forest and swamp, and was now flowing\\nthrough open country between high banks.  Pushing the raft\\nashore, they stepped off on the sand, and, warming up the remains\\nof the mastodon's heart, ate a substantial breakfast.\\n\\nWhile washing their knives in the stream preparatory to leaving\\nit--for they wished to return to the Callisto by completing the\\ncircle they had begun--they noticed a huge flat jelly-fish in\\nshallow water.  It was so transparent that they could see the\\nsandy bottom through it.  As it seemed to be asleep, Bearwarden\\nstirred up the water around it and poked it with a stick.  The\\njelly- fish first drew itself together till it touched the\\nsurface of the water, being nearly round, then it slowly left the\\nstream and rose till it was wholly in the air, and,\\nnotwithstanding the sunlight, it emitted a faint glow.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\" exclaimed Bearwarden, \\\"here we have one of our\\nJack-o'-lanterns.  Let us see what it is going to do.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is incomprehensible to me,\\\" said Cortlandt, \\\"how it maintains\\nitself; for it has neither wings nor visible means of support,\\nyet, as it was able to immerse itself in the stream, thereby\\ndisplacing a volume of liquid equivalent to its bulk, it must be\\nat least as heavy as water.\\\"\\n\\nThe jelly-fish remained poised in the air until directly above\\nthem, when it began to descend.\\n\\n\\\"Stand from under!\\\" cried Bearwarden, stepping back. \\\"I, for one,\\nshould not care to be touched.\\\"\\n\\nThe great soft mass came directly over the spot on which they had\\nbeen standing, and stopped its descent about three feet from the\\nground, parallel to which it was slowly carried by the wind.  A\\nfew yards off, in the direction in which it was moving, lay a\\nlong black snake asleep on the sand.  When directly over its\\nvictim the jelly globule again sank till it touched the middle of\\nthe reptile's back.  The serpent immediately coiled itself in a\\nknot, but was already dead.  The jellyfish did not swallow, but\\ncompletely surrounded its prey, and again rose in the air, with\\nthe snake's black body clearly visible within it.\",\"timestamp\":1636791594,\"title\":\"\\\"So it was, and doubtless is here,\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"Up7w6OfIjN7Pycs27iGK_PJTFSPNqSxk93jK0_umD98\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa5A313A41968f058EF5C36ddC1891B51fF57caAD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ly-iQk98RrOZ9UInO6tfKiLqoDxmCSWqCIAsZfdE6_w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Hc_JTLqZQiy0htmDSyfBRDLWrrPLrrPMx9ZXRQBUO00\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZXPwzfwCuD2C7_arzrzitSPyP-jc-gyFkBdj60tlott5mlCOAn4GseGal2H-zOMMlSJNuVWdVH2P8Fl6ASV7Bw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xcc110d988a0c4d99d6a45902c114e8aa4c1c42e9fac91c50929d2d7fea796381072b7fb76d77c1d7b7de3e27ce04b744131a0eca279b4077eebe903e74e768ee1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Ly-iQk98RrOZ9UInO6tfKiLqoDxmCSWqCIAsZfdE6_w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Hc_JTLqZQiy0htmDSyfBRDLWrrPLrrPMx9ZXRQBUO00\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Up7w6OfIjN7Pycs27iGK_PJTFSPNqSxk93jK0_umD98\"}"
