"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Background\\n\\nThis article provides an overview of how to mint an NFT as a part of the initial release of the Natura collection. NFTs from the collection will be available to mint from the seva.love website, with the official website link to be announced soon. After minting, the NFTs will be available from the Natura OpenSea collection.\\n\\nJoin our discord and follow us on twitter to learn more and be the first to know!\\n\\n## Step 1: Create an NFT wallet\\n\\n*If you already have a crypto wallet skip to step 2*\\n\\nTo store the NFT you will need a cryptocurrency wallet that supports storing NFTs. We recommend using MetaMask. Follow these instructions to set up your MetaMask wallet:\\n\\n1. **Click here to download MetaMask** using mobile application or desktop browser extension\\n2. Open the application and get started to **create a new wallet**\\n3. **Set your password**\\n4. **Write down your seed phrase**. It is best to store this written on a safe piece of paper or device that is not connected to the internet\\n5. **Complete the seed phrase verification** and account setup steps and voila!\\n\\nYou now have a cryptocurrency wallet that supports storing NFTs!\\n\\n**Your public wallet address** is the address that identifies your wallet. You can view it by copying it from below you account name or from the MetaMask menu.\\n\\n![Click the numbers below your account name to copy your MetaMask Public Wallet Address](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/xC9Etz4G5PF4-RgvOHZK7.jpg?height=904&width=1598)\\n\\nOr by accessing it from the user menu\\n\\n## Step 2: Deposit ETH into your wallet\\n\\n*If you already have ETH in your crypto wallet skip to step 3*\\n\\nTo mint the NFT you will need [ETH (Ethereum)](https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/). You can buy ETH from within MetaMask, or set up an exchange account with a company to buy and trade ETH.\\n\\n### To buy ETH from within MetaMask\\n\\nSelect the buy or add funds button to be shown the options, select one and complete the steps to purchase ETH and have it deposited to your wallet.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tNaDo6lj1tyIvPDEPbZPp.jpg?height=1341&width=1613)\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n* You will be charged a “gas fee” to transfer the ETH into your wallet. Gas fees apply to all transaction processed on the Ethereum network, learn more about them here.\\n* Most service providers that you can buy ETH from will require a form of identity verification to comply with government regulations.\\n* While purchasing ETH from within MetaMask allows you to stay within the application, we recommend setting up an exchange account to be able to easily purchase, trade and transfer ETH and other cryptos from an established exchange.\\n\\n### To buy ETH by creating an exchange account\\n\\nYou can transfer ETH that you buy from a supported exchange into your MetaMask. \\n\\nThe growing list of options includes:\\n\\n* **[crypto.com](https://crypto.com)** *(for beginner buyers, funds are available immediately)*\\n* **[coinbase.com](https://coinbase.com)** *(funds are available within 3-5 business days)*\\n* **[pro.coinbase.com](https://pro.coinbase.com)** *(for intermediate buyers, funds are available within 3-5 business days from signing up)*\\n* **[kucoin.com](https://kucoin.com)** *(for intermediate buyers, funds are available immediately)*\\n* **[gate.io](https://gate.io)** *(for intermediate buyers, funds are available immediately)*\\n* **[binance.us](https://binance.us)** *(for intermediate buyers, not available for all states)*\\n* **[binance.com](https://binance.com)** (*for intermediate buyers, not available for US residents*)\\n\\n**[Learn more about the different ways to buy ETH here](https://ethereum.org/en/get-eth/)**, and use the the country based search engine to view options based on your country.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8a9D7O5yEjnt7WlJckuc2.png?height=1840&width=654)\\n\\n* You cannot transfer ETH to your MetaMask (or other decentralized wallet) from all exchanges. For example Venmo, CashApp, and Robinhood all do not currently allow you to transfer ETH from your account to another wallet.\\n\\nNote that \",\"timestamp\":1642667855,\"title\":\"Natura - How to Mint Your NFT\"},\"digest\":\"TVWNul4h0aEKq3dnysAFNMmM0klKZh_U2gdTG8Vb1cM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8f6Aa8886b69eec86d4cC856794024EA12Da2990\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Yl5gdffTPqD84fkkSySTD98X9BvvU-26NZCq5C7FGLQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i1aok6ZLWSwj1kRoKQ1tgd5siK4hLWGxT8xtnVcZPe0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"fGvCp8v2Tgu767d-pQaRuJ4npixsCGNQIicub3yEO0WbertPl2N6t_FeWHVRut0ueNbwWDh33MXoaxxqCVvhUw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x73c26c253809597aab29361e9dea6fc6bee952522e7eba6e953b275dce362aab4e67b3aad348906e694a67080f4b214228f7fc3793d2a24654e4e1da996d3eee1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Yl5gdffTPqD84fkkSySTD98X9BvvU-26NZCq5C7FGLQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"i1aok6ZLWSwj1kRoKQ1tgd5siK4hLWGxT8xtnVcZPe0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"-78kR1KAXKM5KD-mZpLUHGclolfU7SPgPjXrX3NpmyU\"}"
