Such an approach can be substrate-neutral, given the potential for life-forms to take many different chemical forms. He suggests it may be better to attempt to quantify life, rather than to attempt to define it, referring to a modified approach to information theory.\\n\\n**“We use ideas from the new algorithmic formulation of information theory, in which one considers individual objects and the amount of information in bits needed to compute, construct, describe, generate or produce them, as opposed to the classical formulation of information theory in which one considers an ensemble of possibilities and the uncertainty as to which of them is actually the case.”**\\n\\n(*Gregory J. Chaitin*)[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftn3)\\n\\nAlternatively, some scientists put forward the theory that life is a natural consequence of higher-frequency energy that, in effect, started as a neat innovation of atoms or molecules (amino acids) to dissipate excess energy into the environment.\\n\\n**“[Jeremy England](http://www.englandlab.com/) … has derived a mathematical formula that he believes explains this capacity. The formula, based on established physics, indicates that when a group of atoms is driven by an external source of energy … and surrounded by a heat bath (like the ocean or atmosphere), it will often gradually restructure itself in order to dissipate increasingly more energy … under certain conditions, matter inexorably acquires the key physical attribute associated with life.”[\\\\[4\\\\]](#_ftn4)**\\n\\nThis is related to the abiogenesis theory, which states that life started from inanimate non-living matter, such as organic compounds, which over very many stages[\\\\[5\\\\]](#_ftn5) changed (evolved) into life-forms, due to the beneficial conditions that existed at the relevant time and most particularly the access to free usable energy. The line or leap between organic matter to aliveness may be something that we should expect to be replicated elsewhere in the universe, or perhaps it was one incident of inexplicable and improbable good luck. It would be wise for us to act as if it is a case of universal good luck.\\n\\n**“A genome, then, is at least in part a record of the useful knowledge that has enabled an organism’s ancestors — right back to the distant past — to survive on our planet … Looked at this way, life can be considered as a computation that aims to optimize [the storage and use of meaningful information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02420). And life turns out to be extremely good at it.”**\\n\\n(*Philip Ball*)[\\\\[6\\\\]](#_ftn6)\\n\\nThere is a strong correspondence between thermodynamics and information theory. James Clerk Maxwell explored this correspondence with a thought experiment now known as ‘Maxwell’s demon’.\\n\\n**“In the thought experiment, a [demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_(thought_experiment)) controls a small door between two compartments of gas. As individual gas molecules approach the door, the demon quickly opens and shuts the door so that only fast molecules are passed into one of the chambers, while only slow molecules are passed into the other. Because faster molecules are hotter, the demon’s behaviour causes one chamber to warm up and the other to cool down, thereby decreasing [entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) and violating the second law of thermodynamics.”[\\\\[7\\\\]](#_ftn7)**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*dHEXx8YHXp1i1MZR2YBZWA.png)\\n\\nA number of theorists, including Leo Szilárd, Léon Brillouin and, later, Rolf Landauer, looked at the total impact on the system and showed that the thermodynamic cost for an observer (demon) to remember its intention, take action and record information must be included in the total calculation of the entropy of the system.\\n\\nInformation theory shows that even if the demon can do its work without increasing the energy entropy of the system, this will give rise to an information entropy as eventually the demon must wipe its memory clean.\\n\\nThere is always an energy or information cost of any agent acting to change any thermodynamic system. This is related to the concept in quantum mechanics that making an observation (whether by a conscious life-form or non-living apparatus) will always have an impact on the matter or energy being observed.[\\\\[8\\\\]](#_ftn8) There is simply no separate world or universe outside of us to be observed or measured — ‘for here there is no place that does not see you’.[\\\\[9\\\\]](#_ftn9)\\n\\nWhenever a life-form interacts with its environment in any manner, it impacts the total dynamic biosphere in unpredictable ways — the chaos or butterfly effect.[\\\\[10\\\\]](#_ftn10)\\n\\n**“evolution can be understood as a kind of random computational walk through software space.”**\\n\\n(*Gregory Chaitin*)[\\\\[11\\\\]](#_ftn11)\\n\\nThe evolution of life-forms can therefore be seen as having been dictated by a number of extraordinary biological algorithms. They must keep the energy costs of storing and transmitting survival and genesis information to the lowest possible level and as close as possible to the efficiency threshold (known as the ‘Landauer bound’), given the increased costs in energy and entropy of ‘creating’ and retaining such information.\\n\\nLife-forms are demons that direct the flow of energy and matter and try to externalise the costs of staying alive by dumping waste into the surroundings; they can only do this if they develop means of storing, compressing, decoding and discarding information about what is helpful in the struggle for survival and perpetuation. Encoding information in DNA, RNA and culture are ways in which life-forms seek to maintain an advantage in this eternal struggle. They are much more efficient than the best supercomputers in doing so.\\n\\n**“the cost of computation in supercomputers is about eight orders of magnitude worse than the Landauer bound … which is about six orders of magnitude less efficient than biological translation when both are compared to the appropriate Landauer bound. Biology is beating our current engineered computational thermodynamic efficiencies by an astonishing degree.”[\\\\[12\\\\]](#_ftn12)**\\n\\nLife-forms are engaged in a constant sequence of ‘if-then’ assessments to maintain their identity; persistence requires ‘good enough’ predictions about the future. The costs of these continuous calculations and the accumulation of information and errors in the replication of information (including in living cells) eventually lead to individual death as the most efficient means to continue the perpetuation of life in newer forms.\\n\\nAlgorithmic information theories (AIT) are being used in advanced AI, biotech and other applications to try to use efficient short-cuts to generate useful results. Scientists realise that we need to learn more from the natural systems around us. A simple way of thinking about AIT is to consider that it takes much less information to provide the process to generate π than it does to calculate it.\\n\\n**“A code for generating the first 15,000 digits of pi in the programming language C, for instance, can be as short as 133 characters.”[\\\\[13\\\\]](#_ftn13)**\\n\\nIn the blockchain space, we also see the use of tools that take advantage of algorithmic simplicity to create data complexity — for example, use of elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) to create digital signatures that everyone can validate easily but that are extraordinarily difficult to fake or to use to break the underlying private keys that generate the validatable outputs.\\n\\n**“Creationists love to insist that evolution had to assemble upward of 300 amino acids in the right order to create just one medium-size human protein. With 20 possible amino acids to occupy each of those positions, there would seemingly have been more than 20³⁰⁰ possibilities to sift through, a quantity that renders the number of atoms in the observable universe inconsequential … it would have been wildly improbable for evolution to have stumbled onto the correct combination through random mutations within even billions of years. The fatal flaw in their argument is that evolution didn’t just test sequences randomly: The process of natural selection winnowed the field.”**\\n\\nNatural systems (even non-living ones, such as solar systems) tend towards maximum simplicity and stability whilst generating entropy in doing so. This ties in with Jeremy L. England’s work on how unconscious matter is likely to naturally self-organise into life-forms in order to better dissipate environmental energy.\\n\\n**“Every species of living thing can make a copy of itself by exchanging energy and matter with its surroundings. One feature common to all such examples of spontaneous ‘self-replication’ is their statistical irreversibility: clearly, it is much more likely that one bacterium should turn into two than that two should somehow spontaneously revert back into one”**\\n\\n(*Jeremy L. England*)[\\\\[14\\\\]](#_ftn14)\\n\\nGiven the various attractive effects between bodies, smaller bodies such as atoms are also likely to form collective patterns and arrive naturally at more stable energy forms. The transformation of atoms into life-forms is a very efficient way to dissipate free energy.\\n\\nThe beautiful appearance of complexity and order seen in fractals is an example of efficiency in algorithmic complexity. It should not be surprising that living nature has taken advantage of algorithmic simplicity to find short-cuts to survival solutions. The walk may be random, but the work becomes iterative, and also gives rise to variations on a theme, when success is chanced upon.\\n\\nChaitin contends that the walk and work done by nature and life-forms is not entirely random, instead following a distribution based on Kolmogorov complexity. The Kolmogorov complexity of something is the length of the shortest algorithm or code that produces the result. This gives rise to accelerated evolutionary solutions to problems that are not possible with an entirely random distribution.[\\\\[15\\\\]](#_ftn15) Randomness under this approach is the extent to which any string of data can not be algorithmically compressed.[\\\\[16\\\\]](#_ftn16)\\n\\n**“We argue that the proper framework \\\\[for consciousness\\\\] is provided by AIT and the concept of algorithmic (Kolmogorov) complexity. AIT brings together information theory (Shannon) and computation theory (Turing) in a unified way and provides a foundation for a powerful probabilistic inference framework (Solomonoff). These three elements, together with Darwinian mechanisms, are crucial to our theory, which places information-driven modeling in agents at its core.”**\\n\\n(*Giulio Ruffini*)[\\\\[17\\\\]](#_ftn17)\\n\\nThe ability of living organisms to think or make decisions — that is, consciousness — arises from the need of life-forms to model changes in the surrounding environment, including the impact of the actions of the life-form that is interacting with it and is part of it. Reality is simply the best model each life-form believes in, or works within, to make the simplest sense of their environment given the overwhelming and non-computable quantity of data in everyday life.\\n\\n**“the level of consciousness can be estimated from data generated by brains, by comparing its apparent and algorithmic complexities. Sequences with high apparent but low algorithmic complexity are extremely infrequent, and we may call them ‘rare sequences.’ Healthy, conscious brains should produce such data.”**\\n\\n(*Giulio Ruffini*)[\\\\[18\\\\]](#_ftn18)\\n\\nNature and life (like science and logic) love and reward efficiency.\\n\\nLife-forms are a process for simplifying and solving complex problems, where the solution has to be worked in reality and the consequences of failure are often final.\\n\\nIn addition to the algorithmic efficiency that is needed to work more intelligently (to conserve energy), nature has an in-built drive for maximal diversity. Diversity is the strategy that best ensures that some life-forms (and therefore life itself) always perpetuate. This diversity is most on show after periods of biospheric destruction or catastrophe, as witnessed by the many periods of great speciation in the Earth’s past (including the Cambrian explosion).\\n\\n**“Contrary to the tendency of optimization algorithms to converge over time to a single ‘best’ solution, natural evolution instead exhibits a remarkable tendency toward divergence — continually accumulating myriad different ways of being. This observation is the crux of an alternative perspective in evolutionary computation (EC) that has been gaining momentum in recent years: evolution as a machine for diversification rather than optimization.”[\\\\[19\\\\]](#_ftn19)**\\n\\nSapients are therefore required to take account of the value of life-forms (perhaps partly quantified using algorithmic information theory) and the value of diversity of life-forms in their decision-making or they risk, at worst, self-destruction or, at best, an avoidably impoverished life and loss of valuable information. Failure to do so may even encourage destruction by others that might form their ethical frameworks on our current behaviours and laws (such as aliens or AI).\\n\\nOur current ethical deficit would make the prospect of meeting alien life terrifying. If we think that our current ethical level is sufficient, then we should expect aliens to act towards us as we currently do towards each other and, more importantly, to other life-forms with less intelligence or power — in which case extraordinary levels of human death, slavery and suffering will be our reward.\\n\\nIt is more likely that any advanced galaxy-faring civilisation is likely to have had to acquire an ethical framework that incorporates the value of all life and diversity of life-forms in its rule-making in order to avoid self-destruction (either directly through unchecked violence with greater technological capability or by destruction of a viable biosphere or similar). Such a wiser species would be capable of conduct that expressed inter-species respect, so they would likely leave us alone until we had reached a sufficiently mature level to interact with — though they may be here already, watching us develop.\\n\\nAn ethical framework cannot be built on necessarily subjective or local foundations. Any beings from anywhere in the universe making ethical rules should be able to reach similar conclusions as to their axioms. We must also leave some room for dealing with those purely self-centred life-forms that may yet be highly technologically advanced or resourceful. It is of limited value to be right when someone kills you in breach of logic and law.\\n\\nOur natural world is full of problem-solving engines and strategies that have been developed over billions of years. It would be wise to seek to understand the successes of nature and the nature of success: to study and protect each species, rather than destroying them before we even know what they do and how they do it, before we have understood the way of the world.\\n\\n## 8.3. Cosmological Evolutionary Theories\\n\\nIt seems that even this universe must die eventually in order for matter and time to be reborn. Perhaps such cycles are the only in-built natural safety valves against permanent death, darkness or eternal wrongdoing. Dreams of individual immortality, whether AI or otherwise, are in fact immature nightmares — as a moment’s reflection makes clear.\\n\\n**“To those who can hear me, I say — do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed — The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish … You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful. To make this life a wonderful adventure. Let us use that power — let us all unite.”**\\n\\n(*Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin*)[\\\\[20\\\\]](#_ftn20)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*i4c0YpWTsU_ivfaMiJWQ2A.png)\\n\\nSir Roger Penrose has developed a conformal theory of time, with cyclical expansion leading to new singularities after aeons of time. The cooling, expanding universe is eventually left (after extraordinarily long periods) with only massless particles (such as photons) and other forms of energy radiation. These particles without rest-mass have no interaction with time.\\n\\nIn a universe with no massive particles, there is little that can interact with anything else directly, and so the concept of time and space becomes effectively meaningless. In that sense, there is no meaningful difference (other than potentially in scale) between the conditions from which our current universe arose and the conditions that inhabitants of a future universe would perceive when looking at the start of their own universe (i.e., towards the end of our universe).\\n\\nOther theories[\\\\[21\\\\]](#_ftn21) suggest our universe’s initial singularity may be the inside of a supermassive black hole in another universe. Our universe can then be seen as just one small part of a larger self-replicating natural process giving rise to a multiplicity of new universes.\\n\\nAll of these theories are intellectually tempting. In addition to the coincidence of singularities, there is something very interesting about the idea of the greatest areas of entropy *as perceived* in our universe (black holes) being the source of the lowest-entropy states in other universes; it fits with the tricksy perspectival or relative quality of the second law and allows for a truly cyclical quality of entropy. It has a wonderful fractal quality too — a self-similarity at different scales such as we see everywhere in nature.\\n\\n**“Murderers are easy to understand. But this: that one can contain death, the whole of death, even before life has begun, can hold it to one’s heart gently, and not refuse to go on living, is inexpressible.”**\\n\\n(*Rainer Maria Rilke*)[\\\\[22\\\\]](#_ftn22)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n## 8.4. Universal Really Useful Engines\\n\\nLife is universal energy manifesting in extraordinary utility machines; life-forms are really useful engines. We do not know how widespread life is or whether it is confined to Earth, though the sheer vastness of the universe[\\\\[23\\\\]](#_ftn23) makes it plausible that life is already experimenting in other parts of the Milky Way or other galaxies. Though, as Enrico Fermi asked: “*where is everybody?*”[\\\\[24\\\\]](#_ftn24)\\n\\nLife-forms are a natural universal means of recycling energy, of death and entropy, and of creating potentially useful and unique information.\\n\\n**“The invisible Spirit (Atma, Atman) is eternal, and the visible physical body is transitory …The Spirit by whom this entire universe is pervaded is indestructible. No one can destroy the imperishable Spirit. The physical bodies of the eternal, immutable, and incomprehensible Spirit are perishable.”[\\\\[25\\\\]](#_ftn25)**\\n\\nIntelligence, consciousness and other qualities of sentient and sapient life-forms are emergent properties of this continuing experiment with free energy. This interplay of energy and matter, through a process of cooperation and competition, gives rise to all of the extraordinary biological complexity on Earth and all of the knowledge and wisdom that humans have managed to achieve. All life must therefore have value as a utility engine and share this common feature.\\n\\nThe most problematic relative questions will always remain: what is the quantity of utility? How do we measure and value utility? What is the ethical impact of competition for utilisation of resources? These will inevitably tend to lead us back to entirely subjective measurements and values that undermine the enterprise set out in this book.\\n\\nWe will need to keep using scientific methods and non-dualistic thinking to seek to identify and mitigate human-centricity and weaknesses. We can also create a non-anthropocentric ‘Aliveness, Feeling, Intelligence and Wisdom Test’ that *in principle* could be structured to significantly reduce our subjective tendencies when measuring various qualities of life — though until we have another sapient species to communicate with on such matters it is impossible to remove our dominant-species prejudices.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\ncontinued in:\\n\\n[https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/bokEd54LeIcLccR3phUiqAqV_rDGGmXDmMTnejdyLTY](https://mirror.xyz/0x6e2fBc139e37b43f4F29cC10B7BeDe36587f7306/bokEd54LeIcLccR3phUiqAqV_rDGGmXDmMTnejdyLTY)\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\n[\\\\[1\\\\]](#_ftnref1) Ioannis Tamvakis, *[Quantifying Life](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336878361_Quantifying_Life)*, 2019 CE.\\n\\n[\\\\[2\\\\]](#_ftnref2) Vincent van Gogh, “[Tree Roots and Trunks](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vincent_van_Gogh_-_Tree_Roots_and_Trunks_(F816).jpg)”,\\\\* \\\\*1890 CE, Wikipedia, public domain.\\n\\n[\\\\[3\\\\]](#_ftnref3) Gregory J.
