Making sure its valuable enough for the mainstream to use profitably, or for an elite group to use. \\n\\nI think I have the answer. I think I know what’s ahead of me. I actually really like traveling with Hannah. I think traveling sounds more exciting to me than working for Galia full time. I’m not looking to report to anyone. I’m not looking to answer to anyone except someone who I’m working for on a project basis. I’m looking for time off. To myself. To ask some deeper questions about what comes next. I don’t want to take this decision lightly. I need to figure out myself a bit more before making this type of commitment. I’m happy to do some contract work and potentially serve as an advisor. For Ola in particular I would rather just do work for the DAO. I want to learn how to create DAOs that create positive impact on the world around us. \\n\\nI’m sitting here watching the sky. The blue and dark grey clouds passing bye. The dreamworks moon hanging out on its side - parallel to a star, most likely a planet. Ah yess… we are just wisps of strings fluttering through space on a planet that allows for organic life forms that have consciousness. That can farm the land. This existence is truly spiritual and humbling in every dimension. \\n\\nI don’t know if it’s Costa Rica per se. But I think it’s a traveling salesman type work. Except the sales are going to be tremendous. I do think that going to visit Puerto Rico again is important. For at least December. Will you give it a shot? Explore it together. We can also take trips to the other islands. Learn some Spanish. Have people meet us and go on adventures. \\n\\nSo I have a bunch of business ideas\\n\\nOne is just coinbase arbitrage and signing people up. People are afraid because coinbase is not trustworthy enough. And there aren’t great advisors in the space. \\n\\nYou’ll learn\\n\\n1. The history of cryptocurrency \\n2. Why it’s still very early in terms of financial returns\\n3. How to construct an investment strategy that meets your return objectives\\n4. What portfolio of assets to hold in crypto\\n5. How to invest in the market over the short-term, medium-term, and long-term\\n\\nYou’ll enter a community of people who\\n\\n1. Want to learn more about decentralization and web 3.0\\n2. Believe in the power of large scale coordination in order to create positive social change  \\n3. Get access to exclusive content that can generate significant ROI on your crypto \\n4. Ultimately want to move to a fairer more transparent culture representative of global plurality\\n\\nSo there’s a bit of a teaser. I’m going to create videos every day about crypto. I’m going to create podcast / live streams with crypto experts. This is the future we are all craving and we all want. I’m going to throw retreats. We can invest some money in events but it’s often a losing effort. I just want to have no obligations whatsoever. Just to see what I’m like in that pure state. Reduce the noise to a minimum. \\n\\nLive in gratitude and do the work to feel harmony. I need weed in the city. I can’t process all the data that’s coming in if I’m not high in the city. In the nature - I can really slow down. It’s beautiful. Just got a taste of Puerto Viejo. That was fucking sick. \\n\\nI’m excited to learn how to use Mirror. Just by being early to Mirror I know that I will have a bright future. That’s all. I just have faith in Mirror. In looking in the mirror every day and really getting to know myself. Slowing down. I’m in a relationship. I honestly want to take some time and get to know myself again. I’m not sure I want to be in an exclusive relationship. Wow. The pain that comes up. I think Hannah is an incredible partner. I love her. I love us. But I also love life and need to understand myself better. I am definitely being slowed down. In a good way though. I don’t need to keep going. I need to just slow down. This is the first time. The working world is a certain speed. I’m not yet ready to press the gas in that way. \\n\\nI definitely need to figure out taxes. There’s a part of me that just wants to relive it all and reflect on all of my transactions. I need a concierge service. Kermesse got back to me. Such good sounds. I want to DJ again. I want to celebrate life again. I don’t think that’s right. I think we should go party together. I think it will create some sense of growth for both of us to be better. \\n\\nThis platform is magical. it’s just incredibly beautiful and simple. No threads. Just a place to manifest reality. Getting back to people. I need to just disappear for a bit. Just fall off the face. Just really get back in touch with nature and G-d. All these people are cool. But I need something different. I just feel like I’m not 100% sure with Hannah based on the past few weeks I feel something brewing again. I love her. In many ways. I love that she is working out. It makes me feel so good when you work out. That’s just the truth. Because I have a physical attraction to fitness. I see how you are attracted to me when I work out. It’s a whole nother level. I feel incredibly lucky.  \\n \\n\\nNow. Crypto does something to you. Best practices to avoid crypto addiction. \\n\\nThey just opened a castle in Scotland for people with this addiction. It’s bad. I just checked. I am in shock - my assets & combined net worth. Truly wild. Probably time to go down to spot a bit but because of taxes I’m stuck being levered. I mean I have about 30% which is levered and could go to 0. I have another 70% which is a mix of spot market which is worth a lot. If the leveraged stuff goes negative before the end of the year, I can offset my airdrop income with losses? Need to figure that one out. Good to see Tomer today. What a fucking awesome experience. Just enjoy it. Inner harmony and peace. When you align with the universe it aligns back. I’m feeling my appetite increasing. \\n\\nNow maybe its time to focus on my career. I believe that through onboarding people to coinbase and airdrops I can make enough money to be fully autonomous. Just working with different people who want exposure. I can work for a different division and just get a % of sales for getting Israeli users into crypto. Most of the country can’t get in. \\n\\nI can sell tons of crypto into the market. If I just help Israelis get bitcoin. Do I need a license to sell crypto? Yes. I need to be regulated. I need to help people in America get in. \\n\\nThat’s cool. What else? Financial advisory. VC is a specific function. I”m not ready to commit to VC for the next 10 years without getting some exposure to other fields. If you’re interested me being a strategic advisor for Tectona Group and I’m going to do what I want. I’m not going to report to anyone. I’m just going to travel and meet interesting people and learn about interesting things. I will report what I want back to you. \\n\\nI do believe in that. \\n\\nBlockfi, Kraken, Coinbase\\n\\nUniswap, Sushiswap, Quickswap, SpiritSwap, Dydx\\n\\nMy lazy lion collection is currently worth at least $27k. That’s cool. But nothing. I will just hold those. It’s a great community with a lot planned. BUt yes - as the founders of the community create - the members get value. We need to create a just a moment NFT. That’s pretty cool. You can use it for whatever the community is planning to do. Where can the royalties go? The royalties go to pay Adar, Max, and Julian’s salaries so that they can work on content creation. But that’s already paying us enough to live sustainably. I think the upside is huge for being completely out of the matrix. Entrepreneurship. A VC trying entrepreneurship. \\n\\nI’m going to start a crypto school. I want to create something similar to a16z. But what are we going to teach? The history of crypto. I’m just going to work on the book for a year. And after that - I’ll be happy to consider joining as Partner. There’s so much to learn here. Wow. The hold-up after Biden’s comments. It’s clear the barrier to entry for participation are coming down. The credit card networks are letting us buy crypto - it’s over. We are borrowing from the banks to overthrow them. \\n\\nThat’s beautiful. The banks are owned by shareholders - but some are owned by taxpayers. Why is the federal reserve there? It constructs monetary policy. Which can be used to make more money and use it for certain social programs. We can pay off those liabilities more easily if there’s more money in circulation. Inflation is just bad. We just want deflation. Nope. That’s what we want. We want it to get cheaper to produce everything. We are being taught that inflation is good and healthy. \\n\\nI don’t mean deflationary cycle. I mean the cost of production actually being reduced by competition that can then offer better prices for more. RIght now we are becoming much less productive. We are seeing less food for higher prices. That’s what’s happening right now. Food is becoming a luxury for many families who are either borrowing unsustainably or eating less. Many families simply will lose the means to feed themselves. We will need food shelters to step it up big time. We need to automate food shelters. Just make basic food free. We need to pay for food for all. That’s something I want socialized. \\n\\nCan we socialize housing? We can. We can take taxes and pay a fair competition of available homes. But not if we artificially limit the # of homes. The penalty for bad government used to be basically nothing. We are seeing rising penalties in the information age for bad governance. It’s beautiful. And necessary. For progress - real progress to continue. Now - when you have representative democracy you have a lot of groups of people telling their congressperson - we are starving. We are hurting. We need you to pass these laws that help us. That’s the eternal democratic political struggle. \\n\\nYou’ll see more power outages, food and fuel shortages, more homelessness, crime, violence, and disease. This is the cost of failed government. We the people of the earth are responsible for all that is happening. We need to coordinate effectively and economically through the internet and take back the control. That’s the game. \",\"timestamp\":1633796338,\"title\":\"Notes from a Bike Ride\"},\"digest\":\"cIAlPYLhKiHXn37Wily1cAPpLX7kMGyZTbOJEQDggEs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7b769566882Df5c3B7f2c7985ff3B328c17418F4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0bbxYZmxA3Kgm5QmgjjWjZUyCmtnxvFUOh5WjzHwEsk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Zfout5S-imGQyd_iDJI73VUkPLwK3b1ReKPPs6KBQ7E\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uRLUow5LV-P7xXRFAL4gfVz3Z0KknC8gRZQZq-FtLoxZ3wI-oxjjf5UybBQfILZc_NEywTP5L2Bdr7BszZASaw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0a4b0cfc0b322694f18d59ca4ad1e5ab82725d5279dd3156a0ba63b0bd1324eb0769f7bffa78526af183675882cf59bb492908756ef3c00378a0db3ddcd831241b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0bbxYZmxA3Kgm5QmgjjWjZUyCmtnxvFUOh5WjzHwEsk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Zfout5S-imGQyd_iDJI73VUkPLwK3b1ReKPPs6KBQ7E\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cIAlPYLhKiHXn37Wily1cAPpLX7kMGyZTbOJEQDggEs\"}"
