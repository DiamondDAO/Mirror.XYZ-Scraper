It takes hours, days and weeks because; If you don’t choose your cities best venue, someone else will.\\n\\nNonetheless, once you have that dream venue it’s plane sailing!\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*Venue Dating\\n’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’’**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*Personality |\\\\*\\\\* We choose beautiful venues that are unique, alternative, creative, edgy, funky, arty, traveller friendly, off-beat, or just with a special character. We work with independent businesses who nurture their venue’s vibe. Forget chains!\\n\\n**Not all about looks |**\\nIt seems there are dozens of perfect venues in your city, but as you look closer, it becomes clear that finding that truly compatible match takes love and patience.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IRxqMZ010wAcKzkYh8hiY.png?height=605&width=908)\\n\\n**Plan in a circle**  **|**\\nLanguage schools, universities and big train stations are in the centre of your city as they are in every other city around the world. However, our aim is open 3, 4 or more weekly events in your city. To open 1 event in the centre of a mega-city is short-sighted. Ask yourself, if you were to open 5 events in your city tomorrow, where would they be?\\n\\n**Why the CBD / Centre, will only waste your time |**\\n\\n• High prices \\n • Bars are already busy. We’re not needed. \\n • Full of office workers in suits. Suits kill vibe\\n• People working or studying in the centre go home to change in the suburbs at 5pm, and are too tired to come back to the centre. \\n • Bars with no character. Only generic penny-pinching chain bars survive.\\n\\n**The Fringe**\\nWhere cool bars hang out.\\nThey know they must nurture their community in order to succeed, just like us!\\nIndependents are often run by open-minded owners open to trying new ideas, rather than corporate offices with inflexible policies. The fringe has trendier bars, sweeter vibes, lower prices, less suits and more authentic smiles.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DRRunSL2TrpnaVqsEAell.png?height=800&width=800)\\n\\n**Your City Map |**\\nWe provide you with a City Map (please don’t create it yourself).\\nUse the City Map to mark businesses (bars, hostels and language schools) and take notes on them.
