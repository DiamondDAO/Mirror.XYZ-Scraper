"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Semiotic AI will become the third core protocol developer to join the Web 3.0 network this year and is set to enhance the platform's security, scalability and economic efficiency through the use of emerging technologies.\\n\\nThe Graph Foundation has announced a $60 million eight-year funding grant to Semiotic AI in a bid to expand the start-up software firm's research and development capacity in the sectors of cryptography and artificial intelligence.\\n\\nSpecifically, the partnership will focus on building the architecture required for automated and verifiable indexing and querying on the Graph, in addition to developing micropayments functionalities utilizing zero-knowledge proofs such as ZK-SNARKs.\\n\\nOver the course of 2021, Semiotic AI has worked alongside the Graph to contribute to the growth of the ecosystem with a litany of initiatives, such as the construction of a beta query prediction service, serving in an indexing operation role, supporting zero-knowledge proof infrastructure design as well as receiving an initial grant in March this year, among others.\\n\\nWith this news, Semiotic AI follows in the footsteps of two infrastructure platforms in becoming a core protocol developer on the network. [StreamingFast acquired a $60 million funding grant](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-graph-foundation-taps-protocol-infrastructure-developer-for-60m-grant) from the Graph in June, while blockchain service provider Figment was granted $48 million in late July.\\n\\nCo-founder of the Graph, Brandon Ramirez, shared insights into how Semiotic AI will pursue greater scalability and economic efficiency on the Graph through the usage of artificial intelligence and cryptography, stating:\\n\\n> “They specialize in the same AI toolkit Google Deepmind used to beat the world's best Go player and to then solve the age-old protein folding problem. The Graph is all about data, and just as AI plays a central role in all web2 products, this partnership will contribute to the convergence of AI and the decentralized internet.”\\n\\nIncepted on mainnet in December 2020, the Graph quickly gained prominence as one of the leading indexing and query platforms in the Web 3.0 sphere. At the time of writing, the network supports indexing data from 22 networks, including Ethereum, Arbitrium and Avalanche as well as [facilitating](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/) over 31,000 subgraphs, including ENS Domains, Compound V2, and Uniswap V2, among others.\\n\\nIn early September, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin touted ZK-SNARKs as a potential major technological adoption over the coming decades.\\n\\n> I expect ZK-SNARKs to be a significant revolution as they permeate the mainstream world over the next 10-20 years.\\n>\\n> — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) [September 2, 2021](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1433228277263462401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)\\n\\n***Related: [The Graph explores integrations for Bitcoin, Polkadot and other layer-one blockchains](https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-graph-explores-integrations-for-bitcoin-polkadot-and-other-layer-1-blockchains)***\\n\\nCo-founder and chief technology officer of Semiotic AI, Sam Green, also commented on the recent partnership, using telephone and web searches as prime examples of how a plethora of innovations can blossom from foundational technologies, stating:\\n\\n> “R&D efforts on these utilities resulted in countless inventions that improved communications and access to knowledge for the entire world. As a result of this collaboration, we will similarly invent new, open-source technologies that will benefit both users of The Graph and the larger Web 3.0 community.”\",\"timestamp\":1639380393,\"title\":\"Semiotic AI granted $60 million by the Graph Foundation to support ecosystem growth\"},\"digest\":\"ksiMbRsu8Z-vb0UWhmbfTz8JWQT2l-vQO_thitd6nY4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4eF33d0Bc5233f818ac16c8C0b53304f8BFef275\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HnsdwMs833kaMDSI9cNShtrgebdmkPGK3yantrrlRtc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eMGSd1HXMdWnqzVrgAjKlF__PyeswrgtaI2UINOMpX8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6egIMapxGactSi1THiAbXe_eQfScI6qDB7Rt2b1fT-6FdCoF_lIO16lHt2KDL6wujBy2kPGd96MjwdCeAVXzqw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7432a8aba383def5c417f3f8a21d757219673db6dd6c4e5fc2ba52ba4bdb3e732dc8faf4a6651ae44a64468d0d6f61910a7306f568c0a9b33cc8dd08b021e49a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HnsdwMs833kaMDSI9cNShtrgebdmkPGK3yantrrlRtc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eMGSd1HXMdWnqzVrgAjKlF__PyeswrgtaI2UINOMpX8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ksiMbRsu8Z-vb0UWhmbfTz8JWQT2l-vQO_thitd6nY4\"}"
