Europe, North America, Japan and South Korea and other developed countries housing prices are rising to an astonishing degree. Faced with the high price, many people say they can't afford it.\\n\\nHousing prices continue to rise in many countries around the world\\n\\nMr. Park, a Chinese working in South Korea, spent two weeks with his wife visiting the Seoul real estate market during the pandemic, but the high prices made them feel great pressure.\\n\\nMr. Park's wife: People in Seoul are suffering more and more. They can't buy a house. It's too expensive.\\n\\nThe national average price of housing rose 19.08% this year, the biggest average increase in 14 years, the data showed. About 3.41 million people have moved out of the South Korean capital in the past six years because of high housing prices. High housing prices have become a major concern for the Korean government. South Korean President Moon Jae-in, nearing the end of his term in office, said on a television show that his failure to control rising housing prices was the biggest regret of his tenure.\\n\\nIan Dunes has bought a house in Auckland for NZ $2.4 million, or about 11 million yuan, in a recent auction.\\n\\nNew Zealand's national median house price rose 23.4 percent in October from a year earlier, data showed. In Auckland, New Zealand's largest city, the median home price rose 25 percent to 1.25 million New Zealand dollars, or 5.6 million yuan, setting another record.\\n\\nCourtney, who works for an airline in Sydney, has had to take her son and live with her parents as her income has decreased since the outbreak of COVID-19. Owning a home of her own has become her biggest wish, but the rising cost of housing has made it impossible for her to do so.\\n\\nCourtney, Sydney, Australia: It sold for 635,000 Australian dollars, and I couldn't afford it at 620, 000 Australian dollars.\\n\\nIt's not just Australia. In Texas, Mary Martinez, 30, recently bought her first home after looking at dozens of other properties but being priced out.\\n\\nIn the year to the second quarter of 2021, global average house prices rose 9.2% from a year earlier, led by 25.9% in New Zealand, 18.6% in the US and Slovakia, and 29.2% in Turkey, according to the data.\\n\\nBuilding materials are in short supply and builders are suffering from rising prices\\n\\nWith house prices rising by the day, builders who were supposed to be making money had a bad year. Construction has been hampered by shortages of raw materials and labor, delays, claims and even temporary closures by some builders.\\n\\nAbdel Abdul, a business-management consultant for a real estate development company in Cairo, Egypt, has been hit by rising prices for building materials, and his company has had to raise prices to hedge against bankruptcy. Mr. Abdel said it was not his company's choice. The entire Egyptian real estate market has been hit by rising prices for raw materials.\\n\\nIn addition, tight commodity supplies have led to higher prices for all types of construction materials downstream, forcing property developers to raise prices.\\n\\nIn addition to the rising cost of building materials, labor shortages are also a problem for builders. At a Chicago construction site where a bird's nest stands out in empty rooms, builder Dave Lodge says the development has been idle for a long time because he can't find enough construction workers.\\n\\nThere were more than 330,000 job openings in the U.S. construction industry at the end of September, according to the data. In October, us construction costs rose 12.3 per cent from a year earlier to a record high. Us single-family home construction plunged in October, hit by shortages of building materials and Labour, while the number of homes authorized for construction but not yet started jumped to the highest level in 15 years.\\n\\nUs: Hot home sales buyers armed with cash to snap up the full price\\n\\nSoaring housing prices have not discouraged homebuyers. Since the beginning of this year, many countries around the world have seen a housing boom, and even a difficult situation to get a house. The supply of houses in various countries has also been seriously insufficient.\\n\\nIn New Jersey, Justin Goldberg and his wife Jessica are selling their three-bedroom home. The listing price was $399,000, but after an incentive bid, the house sold for $542,000, or $3.5 million, 1 million more than the listing price.\\n\\nIn the United States, the pace of home sales is at a record high, with buyers snapping up the cash outright. At the end of October, there were 1.25 million homes for sale across the COUNTRY, down 12 percent from a year earlier, and at the current sales rate, homes on the US market would be snapped up in three months.\\n\\nIn addition to the shortage of supply, the pandemic has also changed people's attitudes towards buying homes. Low-density residential areas have become the first choice for some home buyers. In Istanbul, Turkey, real estate agent Ephron has been busy these days, mainly in prime areas along the Bosphorus, where new homes and low density have become so popular that it has become hard to get a room.\\n\\nPrices have also been pushed up by sharply lower mortgage rates, thanks to loose monetary policies by central banks. Late last year, the RBA cut the cash rate to a record low of 0.1 per cent and pushed mortgage rates below 2 per cent. This means that a loan of 2 million Australian dollars would cost less than 40,000 Australian dollars in annual interest, much less than the rent of the same local house. The median home price in Sydney, Australia, rose 30 percent in just one year.\\n\\nKate COLVIN, SPOKESPERSON for THE Australian Social Housing Advocacy Group: The fact is, it's the government's low interest rate policy that's driving up house prices.\\n\\nHang Lu, president and CEO of 21st Century Real Estate China: The European and American markets generally rise in a cycle of five to eight years, this wave of real estate cycle should go for more than two years, according to the logic of the past, there should be two or three years of growth.\",\"timestamp\":1638781930,\"title\":\"One room hard to find? !
