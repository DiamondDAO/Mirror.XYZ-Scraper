"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Initially, my entire objective for investing in cryptocurrencies was to drop my savings in Anchor and earn an amazing annual percentage yield on my deposits. Once I accomplished depositing the amount that I had decided to bring to Anchor (which was no small feat for a newcomer), I began to look around to see what other opportunities existed in Terra. Of course, liquidity pools were everywhere and looked very interesting. From the first day I started reading about liquidity pools, I noticed that more attention is given to the concept of impermanent loss than the rewards from participating in them. \\n\\nAll these warnings are important, especially to new arrivals like myself; unfortunately, the decrees of doom and gloom raining down on me initially scared me off completely. I finally decided that I needed to get off the bench and take a swing at this. Hit or miss, I felt like I had to step up to the plate. \\n\\n## The Yield Junkie\\n\\n \\n\\nIt will come as no surprise to you that I am a self-declared yield junkie. I love everything I have found in Terra, from cuddly puppies to evolving meteors, but at the end of the day it is all about creating those passive income streams for me.\\n\\nFirst, I decided to try my hand at the Anchor liquidity pool. Completely by accident, I discovered the Terra Floki project and I said: “why not try out their liquidity pool, as well”. I felt that these two perfectly balanced themselves out: one is a typical DeFi farm and the other is a NFT puppy mill.\\n\\n \\n\\n## Real Life Examples\\n\\n \\n\\nJust as an illustration, I want to share what has happened so far in these first two liquidity pools that I am still participating in: Anchor Protocol and Terra Floki.\",\"timestamp\":1638433110,\"title\":\"Let’s Embrace Impermanent Loss\"},\"digest\":\"ltkEDeM4_MFMJOhEZpvILhLT0QcG3_yFZZJw-f3Sjiw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xe26FC2940D8adB1280fD8100705dA5fA30df20DD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2t36sOtV0XWaLCwYAt1eqaqo_nOSkwmh_NkrwSlifKY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LDc2f3uQBrr2DTcuS5wnR9CpoJIVLFNKnyEaPtARO8Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HY0KYvh-RJ84EjwITZ_su3OfAftY6M63Vyx639tZWlgHXk6QYO69rLinscvV5kGs8cqXtAb_altgq1EOHFvicQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x684402f05f5e9e85815ef4a6c6a21f628bd3c452014a0269876e6af2cc78fbc4021296ebf20d95ffdbb3b846316efb498aa03b29b86fe8b06bdc3aa347d4a4321b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2t36sOtV0XWaLCwYAt1eqaqo_nOSkwmh_NkrwSlifKY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"LDc2f3uQBrr2DTcuS5wnR9CpoJIVLFNKnyEaPtARO8Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ltkEDeM4_MFMJOhEZpvILhLT0QcG3_yFZZJw-f3Sjiw\"}"
