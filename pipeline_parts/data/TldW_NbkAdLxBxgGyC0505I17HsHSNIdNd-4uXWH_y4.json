Foreign law enforcement agencies raised 38 requests. These came from countries including the US, UK, France, Austria, Switzerland and Germany. But over 90 per cent of the accounts were blocked after complaints from other users and the company’s internal tracking mechanism.\\n\\nNischal Shetty, Founder, WazirX, told BusinessLine, “WazirX is part of Blockchain and Crypto assets Council (BACC) along with other crypto exchanges. Our exchange is able to trace all users on the platform with official identity information. We already have a robust KYC and AML enabled policy that we follow to self-regulate in the absence of regulatory guidelines. All the necessary information to track malicious activities that are “facilitated” by blockchains are publicly available.”\\n\\nHe added, “Additionally, WazirX has collaborated with TRM Labs, a cryptocurrency compliance platform, for transaction monitoring and investigation, wallet screening and risk management. It has helped bolster the security of the platform and scale compliance initiatives.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1638430173,\"title\":\"The coin is very good\"},\"digest\":\"HfwZ-P62CAf0389eNvhNnizphbZT1WaSEskikzRAbIg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x650c72bC6B7cde71FF675ac246a43D408b793142\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Vudbkxzz17GBCiZxl8gRp2J4FbMiPnPWjerDRxYD820\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G9GUWMZMnkCBz7IVwMmVTpHe8noCP0a0C_MK1ZmDSBE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uPDRXLtf3iS-xm2raLd1cC9Dkpslr213iKs4F2MCuKtM0-3vdiZ3F-1tMtkEfOdvizMaPh0wqylk_A5aTRrWCg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc550570c2831a545732b41e748c3a9718f3cfaf74a50fc193893bcd0e6e060401a50c2ee25e54db1d812e35a3265bf24f4bcda133282ea4a526b02ceaba182281b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Vudbkxzz17GBCiZxl8gRp2J4FbMiPnPWjerDRxYD820\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G9GUWMZMnkCBz7IVwMmVTpHe8noCP0a0C_MK1ZmDSBE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HfwZ-P62CAf0389eNvhNnizphbZT1WaSEskikzRAbIg\"}"
