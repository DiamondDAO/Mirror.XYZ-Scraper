"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I love music.\\n\\nI know that‚Äôs a clich√©, but I need to say it in order to give some credit where it‚Äôs due.\\n\\nI owe a massive part of my love for music to my brother, who would blast punk rock and rap music while we were in his car driving to the one grocery store in town that sold Bawls Energy Drink, or someplace even more peculiar like the local Magic: The Gathering retailer. Prior to listening to explicit artists ranging anywhere from Eminem to System of a Down, I was mostly exploring my stepdad‚Äôs country music CDs on a walkman while taking the school bus to elementary school.\\n\\n*God damn you, Alan Jackson and Jimmy Buffet. Time Zones are not an excuse to drink.*\\n\\nWhen I was old enough to navigate a computer, I was absorbed into PC gaming. I would spend entire days on end playing MMORPGs and shooters. I would wake up a few hours before school in order to play on my favorite Grand Theft Auto roleplay server as a police officer or gang member. I had grown up playing console games like Mortal Kombat and Tomb Raider with my bro, so it was no surprise that I found myself devoutly PC gaming. Once again, that‚Äôs all thanks to my brother. The guy got me into everything I like. He even introduced me to my favorite sport, basketball, and coached me through the youth league I played in.\\n\\n![The legend himself, sweetly resting his head on my leg, almost certainly at the request of our mom. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/TloAJ-i6fr4E4JS30wYN1.JPG?height=1150&width=1195)\\n\\nHowever, when I wasn‚Äôt playing a video game or shooting hoops with my brother or my childhood best friends, I was scouring the vast catalog of music made available on the internet. (Looking at you, LimeWire.) It was by my own exploration that I eventually found a deep resonance with electronic music. Rapping all the words to ‚ÄúThe Real Slim Shady‚Äù is special, anyone will tell you that, and head-banging to ‚ÄúBrain Stew‚Äù by Green Day is just good fun, but a song made entirely by computers?\\n\\nNow that‚Äôs pure *‚ú® magic. ‚ú®*\\n\\nIn middle school, I dabbled in questionable emo and scene genres by the accord of my own angst, but they almost always incorporated some electronic element. Eventually, I found myself listening to more and more electronic music as I entered high school. Mostly house-pop sensations like Calvin Harris, Avicii, and Swedish House Mafia, but also some bass-heavy OGs like Flux Pavilion, Knife Party‚Ä¶ oh, and don‚Äôt even get me started on the don himself, **Skrillex** ü§òüëΩ, who effortlessly fuses genres while simultaneously creating new ones‚Ä¶ I could write a whole article on how he‚Äôs influenced my artistic pursuits with his ability to set bleeding-edge trends with each release. Not to mention, Sonny (his first name, as he‚Äôs called frequently by his fans) radiates intensely positive vibes from his infectious, high-energy attitude, that any performer would be blessed to possess.\\n\\n![My girlfriend would probably embarrass me and reveal to you that I find this man extremely handsome.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/T_uKEaswIJvmeEp8oTX-q.jpeg?height=860&width=1400)\\n\\nI would sit in my first whip, a Ford Focus, with freshly sleepy eyes on a cold winter morning, and find my blood more warmed by ‚ÄúRight In‚Äù (the most underrated ‚ÄúBangarang‚Äù EP track) than the car‚Äôs defroster/heater combo.\\n\\nI was 15 years old when I discovered **Madeon**. The memory is a little fuzzy in my head, probably because at this exact moment, I was vaping some terrible Utah marijuana from my Magic Flight Launch Box vaporizer. Madeon was a young kid, two years older than me, releasing tracks that put the production capabilities of some of my favorite electronic artists to shame. I recall discovering his tracks ‚ÄúPop Culture‚Äù and ‚ÄúIcarus‚Äù in that order. ‚ÄúPop Culture‚Äù made me want a Novation Launchpad more than I wanted to be a professional basketball player just a few years earlier, and ‚ÄúIcarus‚Äù electrified my brain and sent chills down my body‚Ä¶ It felt incredible! I couldn‚Äôt believe what I was hearing. This was the straw that broke the camel‚Äôs back. I immediately pirated Ableton Live and installed it on my minimum-spec Macbook Air.\\n\\n![Madeon was only 17 when he recorded \\\"Pop Culture\\\", a 39-song mashup on the fly using a Novation Launchpad. View here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTx3G6h2xyA](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Gre2IDbfs3_lpw1-FHv69.png?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\nI was going to be a music producer just like Madeon. Like Skrillex. Like all the greats.\\n\\nFor me, getting started and having no skills was the ‚Äúgood old days.‚Äù Every track I made was a banger, at least to my untrained ears, from ‚ÄúBoat Sandwich‚Äù (named by a girl I had a crush on) to ‚ÄúUnacceptable‚Äù, a big-room house dumpster fire with a pre-drop vocal sample of Lemongrab from Adventure Time. \\n  \\n When you have no taste, skill, or expectations, you could swear every barebones track you churn out is possibly Grammy-worthy.\\n\\nEquipped with my incredibly original DJ moniker, Gypsyhook, taken from the title of one of Skrillex‚Äôs pre-Skrillex EP‚Äôs  I consistently cranked out more and more terrible tunes while playing DJ sets in my friend Jonny‚Äôs basement every other month.\\n\\n*Shout out to the club owner himself,* https://soundcloud.com/galiximusic\\n\\nAs I got older, I was beginning to break through with my local scene with my more directioned music project, **Hearts**. I was never able to fully live off music, but I only had to work part-time delivering pizzas to make ends meet. I was doing pretty well. I was making friends with artists bigger than myself, and playing shows and clubs. I got to travel out of state to play for hundreds of people, and once played for thousands in my hometown. Globally touring artists were even playing some of my songs in their festival sets.\\n\\n![Me, early 20's, performing as \\\"Hearts\\\" at Sky, a dance music club in  Salt Lake City, UT.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/qBHeoP-wDpsI-8Q8dPYrY.png?height=345&width=478)\\n\\nA collaboration I had with an artist named Crankdat found its way onto Skrillex‚Äôs USB and he played our remix of Desiigner‚Äôs ‚ÄúPanda‚Äù live. However, this didn‚Äôt satisfy me as much as I thought it would. I was disappointed in myself when comparing my contribution to my collaborator. Crankdat did most of the work, and his talents made mine pale in comparison. His process was humbling and complex and I still owe him many thanks for working with me. However, this feeling of not being good enough became a lasting theme.\\n\\nAs time went on, I continued to experience feelings of inadequacy when I compared my tracks and song-making processes to others. I used too many presets and samples. I didn‚Äôt have a backlog of 30 unreleased songs like my friends did. I could only work on one song at a time, and it was taking me far too long to finish them. I was confused because on some good days, I would think my newest track was ready to chart on the Electronic Top 100, but most days, it felt like it was hardly worth a hundred listens. I would feel that I had made no progress at all and that I‚Äôd never catch up to the greats, let alone my peers. At times like this, I became incredibly unmotivated. I knew I had to go ‚Äúall-in‚Äù on my craft or I wasn‚Äôt going to make it, but I began to suffer an inability to motivate myself to keep writing more music. I would stagnate for weeks, months, and once, years at a time without making any music. I would consciously let my dream slip away from me.\\n\\nAt a certain point, I had all but given up. It was months without opening Ableton. I remember being 20, in my dad‚Äôs house, waking up with a hunch to buy Bitcoin as an investment, and discussing my plan with a friend of his about it who would come over and help clean up the house while he was at work. She had told me she saw it on the news a few times and that I should trust my intuition. I wish I could explain this hunch in-depth, but that‚Äôs really all it was. It was just something that hit me when I first woke up. I had transacted in Bitcoin a few times in my rave days (heheheh) and its efficacy at its early job as an under-the-radar digital currency was plenty to convince me of the investment opportunity. I took my life savings from my career and slanging pizzas, and YOLO‚Äôd directly into Bitcoin, Ethereum, and altcoins in early 2017.\\n\\nI remember watching my portfolio evaporate to fractions of my savings within weeks. That was on me. After all, I entered with no technical basis as to what I was doing. However, the processes themselves were intuitive for me and I navigated both the exchanges and the communities with ease. It gave me a similar joy to when I was making music early on. The markets gave me that feeling of being stupid and experimental. I didn‚Äôt panic when my life savings drained. It was ‚Äúonly a loss if I sold,‚Äù as crypto Twitter would meme. I doubled down on my market participation and followed my hunch deeper.\\n\\nAnyone familiar with the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency cycle knows that by the end of the year, despite being chock-full of noobishness, I was loaded with unrealized gains. I was sitting in mid-6-figure portfolio figures at all-time highs, graciously generated by a basket of shitcoins and ICOs that haven‚Äôt revived since. The DragonChain ICO was my most profitable trade during the cycle.\\n\\nBut remember, I was completely amateur to markets. I had no foundational knowledge of charting, no grasp of supply or demand. The market cycle chart was just a meme, and I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to recognize a top even if you overlayed it on a TradingView chart. I simply bought the projects I thought looked cool or that my favorite influencers shilled, and I paid the price when the cycle came to a screeching halt. That entire time, I realized only enough of those gains to purchase a new computer build, plus some additional rent money. Somewhere around June 2018, I capitulated from the market in immense depression with less than what I had entered with.\\n\\n![My totally professional 2018 market exit, selling the bottom, like an absolute Chad. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aGPh9wjZLWxfSp-fR2060.png?height=1224&width=1502)\\n\\nI was working full-time again to pay for rent. I was a private investigator for a company that would secretly film individuals committing insurance fraud and turn the footage over to their employer. This job was the worst, due to the extreme temperatures of investigators‚Äô weather while in their parked work vehicles, not to mention the inherent sociopathy required to follow someone around in a grocery store with a hidden video camera. Following that, I joined one of the largest Amazon sellers in America to help manage to advertise. It was here I met one of my closest friends, Ryan Kirkland, who would become my right-hand to the project I didn‚Äôt know at the time I‚Äôd launch two years into a global pandemic. (Didn‚Äôt see that coming, either.)\\n\\nThrough this time, I was still engaging with electronic music. I played a few shows under a different name, and I helped a local event organizer rebrand. I would tell myself I was starting new music projects with different names and themes, and getting a fresh start, but I was never able to finish a track. I was depressed. I hated my job, no matter what it was. I felt like I failed miserably at two major opportunities in music and cryptocurrency. I had very little money. In spite of that, I never took my eye off the cryptocurrency markets.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2019, I was at peak depression. I had struggled to give my romantic relationship what it deserved and it would consequentially fall apart and rebuild multiple times over multiple years to a point of exhaustion. I was experiencing sharp pains in my chest for the past two years that I feared were symptoms of an impending heart attack. At the time, I didn‚Äôt know it was simply just an intense anxiety condition. I had planned to travel to Porter Robinson‚Äôs Second Sky Festival in Oakland with a few friends, despite my poor health. I wanted to see Madeon live, who was Porter‚Äôs co-headliner for the event, debuting unreleased tracks from an upcoming album. I had seen him live 3 times and he always outdid himself. The feeling in my chest told me I was due to die at any time, so I had to see him one more time. Furthermore, I was deathly scared of planes, so the flight there nearly did me in.\\n\\n![Madeon debuted tracks from his upcoming album \\\"Good Faith\\\" at Second Sky Festival in June 2019.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RmaRpR78MLYuUAmUH5BYy.jpeg?height=510&width=1024)\\n\\nThe festival, however, was a spectacle of pure magnificence. I felt alive to be in a new place, seeing world-class electronic artists like Porter Robinson, and my favorite, Madeon, playing the first DJ set based on his unreleased upcoming album. Not to mention, a secret performance from Skrillex, who had no rhyme or reason for being there at all, other than to incite feelings of shock and awe in the crowd. The thousands of us were supercharged. It was perfect.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhFiQ8rhTPQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhFiQ8rhTPQ)\\n\\nI was inspired to feel better. I grabbed a self-help book, ‚Äú12 Rules for Life‚Äù by Jordan Peterson, at the airport on the way home, and paid such close attention to it that the fearful tremble in my heart could be ignored until I landed safely.\\n\\nIn the fall of that same year, my father took his own life.\\n\\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/dxkop2/my_father_committed_suicide_today/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/dxkop2/my_father_committed_suicide_today/)\\n\\nI still struggle to process this. Each day I am reminded more and more by my quirks and behaviors just how similar I am to him. We talk the same way. We walk the same way. Sometimes I‚Äôm embarrassed and ashamed that I didn‚Äôt think I had much in common with him. I wish he was able to see how far I‚Äôve come in just a few years since and let him know everything could have been alright. He is dearly missed by a massive community of friends and family, of which he was the glue.\\n\\n![The legend himself, exactly as I remember him. Converse, high socks, shorts, Harley shirt, and Bruno, a poodle since lost to time that he loved more than anything.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nTxO5k0hRFLS1CWIgBn7X.jpg?height=800&width=450)\\n\\nSince that previous summer, I had been exploring self-help and philosophy as a means to rid myself of anxiety and become a stronger person. I found myself particularly drawn to Stoicism. I was reading a lot and found myself active on online communities like the one I linked to above. I could feel myself becoming more whole again. I had read ‚Äú12 Rules for Life‚Äù three times, and because of that, I was able to follow Jordan Peterson‚Äôs cardinal rule from the book, to ‚Äúbe the strongest man at your father‚Äôs funeral.‚Äù However, the pain was overwhelming. I needed a fresh start, and I left my hometown to live on the west coast.\\n\\nI felt extremely lucky to have started on a path to becoming a more mentally and emotionally strong and conscious person right before the largest tragedy of my life struck. I want my dad back more than I want to accomplish any silly personal goal. Loved ones are far more important than any specific desire. Despite this loss, I continued on a path of self-actualization that led me deep into spiritual paths and metaphysical truths that most versions of myself and the majority of others would dismiss, and I haven‚Äôt looked back since.\\n\\n*Thanks to my delving into spirituality, I am given the consolation of knowing no one is ever truly lost.*\\n\\nIn 2020, a few months after the national COVID-19 announcement, I once again redeployed the majority of my savings into cryptocurrency. I familiarized myself with DeFi during ‚ÄúDeFi summer‚Äù, which helped me grow my portfolio well into profit. In the fall, I was scammed for a large amount of ETH in an NFT trading card project that ceased development abruptly and pulled liquidity. In its community, I met a fellow degenerate who hired me as an advisor to his blockchain project after he told me he liked how little tolerance for bullshit I had from the developers.\\n\\nThis opportunity was nothing short of remarkable. I was able to develop the initial community for¬† https://WorldMobile.io, a low-cost global mobile network built on the blockchain, aimed at serving the 3 billion unconnected in Africa and beyond. I still remain on the project as an advisor.\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAOvIp4JwU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYAOvIp4JwU)\\n\\nSoon after joining World Mobile, I met an anonymous individual who was willing to be my teacher. He was able to show me how to navigate cryptocurrency charts without bias using proven methodologies. With his help, my performance improved tenfold and I have been able to grow and protect my portfolio since. A small community of amateur traders that I had amassed on Discord, that would eventually comprise my core team, would weather multiple periods of massive gains and massive drawdown as a unit.\\n\\nMy mood had improved drastically with my performance and spiritual pursuits. I had begun working on music again. A close friend, a few years younger than me, that I had mentored in music was surpassing my talents as we talked throughout the years. His ability was unquestionably special, and we found our way into building the Hearts music project as a two-man team. He will be introduced in the next article, and our first track as a duo will be released this January of 2022.\\n\\nFriends, family, and online acquaintances were learning crypto markets and processes through myself and far more talented teachers. We were all highly enjoying the daily company of our tight-knit Discord group. Our community of professionals and bright minds from different walks of life was amassing and building unmistakable camaraderie. Some of us were crypto veterans. Some of us were musicians. Some artists. Some with corporate backgrounds. Some streamers and gamers.\\n\\nAn idea was beginning to form.\\n\\nWe were all experiencing heightened levels of competence and productivity, mixed with a proclivity to explore unorthodox career paths. A greater understanding of each other mixed with time revealed to us the base collection of passions we shared.\\n\\nMusic\\nMarkets\\nGaming\\nArt\\n\\nWe found ourselves comprised of world-class creators and contributors of each one of these four categories of interest, which are currently at the forefront of building the emerging modern world.\\n\\nA world we could actively shape as a team.\\n\\n**Hearts.World**.\\n\\n![A stylization of the Hearts.World 3D logo, created by our art director, Dylan. A variation of this logo is used on nearly all Hearts.World projects.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ueHJxKGB_UKo-enZ2_Y8D.png?height=4660&width=7767)\\n\\nOur goal is simple, albeit ambitious. We aim to gather and incentivize creatives and their audiences under a unifying label, by building a community that bridges them to overlapping industries. In this way, we create an all-encompassing creative flywheel that sources collaboration from within.\\n\\nThe importance of the collaboration between these four industries (possibly more) moving forward can not be overstated. Some examples:\\n\\nMarkets + Gaming = Metaverse narrative, VR, game for a living, player-owned items.\\nMusic + Markets = Music NFT, event ticket NFT, digital concerts, DAO royalties.\\nArt + Markets = Art and generative NFT, web UI/UX, branding. \\n Gaming + Art = Stream, animation, video editing, e-sports.\\n\\nThese sorts of overlaps open creatives in one industry to the audiences and opportunities of the other. Our launch is focused on demonstrating how even a small group or single individual can leverage these emerging overlaps to success. Our community of creators will prove that creatives will benefit from expanding their mission into the industries they‚Äôre not yet a part of.\\n\\nOur initial offerings that will demonstrate our proficiency in extracting the value from the overlap will include:\\n\\nHearts music project, Tyler Kirk and myself, Clint Groves\\nA decentralized record label with profit-sharing\\nA markets education platform for the average Joe\\nAn esports team\\nStreamer sponsorships\\n\\nAnd of course, Heartscord, a Discord community for everyone.https://discord.gg/heartscord\\n\\nAll of these offerings will utilize the emerging philosophies of Web3, DAOism, and our newly introduced philosophy of industry overlap, as means of revenue generation and audience targeting.\\n\\nEveryone is invited to bring their ideas to life under the Hearts.World label. All are welcome to join us in our Discord channel where it all began, or reach out to us through any of our social media. We are actively seeking creators of all mediums to join the official team and we are offering contracted opportunities and grants to developers and artists.\\n\\nOur Discord community has a number of professionals in the aforementioned industries to collaborate with. Server activity is rewarded with NFT airdrops and an in-server shop that offers real-life items and experiences, as well as digital goods.\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read my personal story and how it grew into a passion project of everything my friends and I have ever been interested in. We can‚Äôt wait for our projects to emerge one by one on the radars of their respective industries and for Hearts.World to be revealed as their aggregator to all.\\n\\nOnce again, if you have any desire to develop or help the mission, please reach out to explore opportunities to join the Hearts team.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to my core team, **The Keep**: Ryan, Tyler, Adri√°n, Krish, and Dylan.\\nSpecial thanks to my administrators, **The Watch**.\\n\\nNext article, I will outline the future of the Hearts music project and the introduction of The Wizard TK, Tyler Kirk, as ¬Ω of Hearts. Tyler and I have been composing a collection of groundbreaking electronic music tracks that we can‚Äôt wait to show the music world. And the crypto world‚Ä¶ and the gaming world‚Ä¶ with the best digital art‚Ä¶ whatever, you get it.\\n\\nThank you and Happy New Year.\\n\\n/ Clint, Founder of Hearts.World\\n\\nhttps://hearts.world\\n\\nSelf: https://twitter.com/Clint0x\\nMusic: https://twitter.com/whoshearts \\n Crypto: https://twitter.com/HeartsCrypto\\n\\n![Anything is possible with a team of friends.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JrEZjcQQxi953RresUIXF.jpg?height=611&width=611)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641072124,\"title\":\"(Re)birth\"},\"digest\":\"FL1V1v9tpeRHmfJJ1PmHEGSdS_K6HnXjoa--QNjzQLw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d1d55eE41A28fEe24dA38B436bcf45F67233c12\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bqMv6H26UzxQa4VG2iM2Exrta9fU5qIz267BTaXxtDg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BFwx2ad-pgX40_1BoKhXbc0k2vt6GmiFg46EHV66L78\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pjqYmhjVrzEMuDjV8zXcRHp4NFf3Jb29ttktfhXQVv5D5q0JkXEW1skwQKqLHYeM5wNvgcwKoY5Pbt47Ox3iHQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc424d9f59d2abab6353ff44b2028d484ca2fd1a24f83b1fc798aee5155cda6451bceec2f12bfa8fd30adb4cc390c3a0c219f2afa4a155a7bd1ab88354f739a691b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"bqMv6H26UzxQa4VG2iM2Exrta9fU5qIz267BTaXxtDg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"BFwx2ad-pgX40_1BoKhXbc0k2vt6GmiFg46EHV66L78\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4R3k5oS5k74h5BqMsxX8XS9bw0AiO5As9e40x-3DDuI\"}"
