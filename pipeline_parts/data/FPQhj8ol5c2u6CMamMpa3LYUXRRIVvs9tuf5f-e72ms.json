"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> An automobile company uses a hybrid environment to run its technology infrastructure using a mix of on-premises instances and AWS Cloud. The company has a few managed instances in Amazon VPC. The company wants to avoid using the internet for accessing AWS Systems Manager APIs from this VPC.\\n>\\n> As a Systems Administrator, which of the following would you recommend to address this requirement?\\n\\n**Ref:**\\n\\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html#what-is-privatelink](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html#what-is-privatelink)\\n\\n[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-create-vpc.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/setup-create-vpc.html)\\n\\n**Ans:**\\n\\n**You can privately access AWS Systems Manager APIs from Amazon VPC by creating VPC Endpoint** - A managed instance is any machine configured for AWS Systems Manager. You can configure EC2 instances or on-premises machines in a hybrid environment as managed instances.\\n\\nYou can improve the security posture of your managed instances (including managed instances in your hybrid environment) by configuring AWS Systems Manager to use an interface VPC endpoint in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC). An interface VPC endpoint (interface endpoint) enables you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately access Amazon EC2 and Systems Manager APIs by using private IP addresses. PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between your managed instances, Systems Manager, and Amazon EC2 to the Amazon network. This means that your managed instances don't have access to the Internet. If you use PrivateLink, you don't need an Internet gateway, a NAT device, or a virtual private gateway.\",\"timestamp\":1641270793,\"title\":\"[Web 2][AWS] VPC endpoints\"},\"digest\":\"cIqtMxBDEdzDdoes1xZlpDDQdy0ONBggTMFcHheQBzA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd0368eE169498faad1AF9aBFbdC8C9CAE432aBe5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BEsnhfd1DkMbOlZ4HfBQZmBmbzM9-wLJnhivFRpydP0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kIztSFJ6BfDUg3JD89g0RIFYZ25Au0U5MSyg4Bb1KcI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ojbjVxzSuTmICzvQrodyxuAPgnMcat3CEUFwd9BGsPslEzxmYANhYNnRz50nBKjxd4bl7NmzVlSuEDPJgaVTMA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xce4ff89d77bbf6971dbe18d682a15f33c5095aad10718caa6f04339b5d1ec16f2ef845c3723a780509308ba22876d40fa5114045bf244d200de3342f53cfd3351b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BEsnhfd1DkMbOlZ4HfBQZmBmbzM9-wLJnhivFRpydP0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kIztSFJ6BfDUg3JD89g0RIFYZ25Au0U5MSyg4Bb1KcI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PGM9EKpZcL8cW23aECU8VijpQjOnj58XO4mJrXn_zH4\"}"
