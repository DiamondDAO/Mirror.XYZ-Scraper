"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Employees who have not been brainwashed are not good employees, and they are very difficult to use. If we regard employees as a machine, for example, a computer. Brainwashing is equivalent to installing a system for employees. This system is divided into win7, win8, and apple systems. The employee's body is the hardware configuration. Install different systems according to different configurations. If we want to control employees, we must control the procedures in their minds.\\n\\nIn the first step of brainwashing, we need to consider the hardware configuration of our employees. What kind of education has this employee received, whether he is introverted or extroverted, and what hobbies he has. For example, the staff's configuration is very low, and the elementary school only reaches the second grade, so the purpose of our brainwashing is not to let him be a good manager. Maybe it is to let him be a security guard and tell him to love his post and do his duty. Being a security guard is great, do it well. As for a programmer, you have to brainwash him and let him design programs with high intensity from morning to night. I also designed a program when I went home and told him that he could become a man like Jobs. Never tell students with a second-year degree in elementary school to learn Jobs. This is a brainwashing without considering employee hardware.\\n\\nThe second step of brainwashing: install anti-virus software for your employees. What do you mean? It is not conducive to the ideas and ideas of our boss to make money. We rejected him and told the employees that it was extremely wrong to do so. For example, \\\"steal company stuff\\\", you can design a system to write it out. Stealing something is a mistake. If such an idea appears, it must be killed like a virus. If someone does, then we will fire him. Antivirus software is a company's rules and regulations and corporate culture.\\n\\nThe third step of brainwashing: install firewalls for employees. We who are bosses must carefully observe the society, foreign thoughts, and work on us\\n\\nIf it is beneficial, we will promote good ideas that are not good for us, and we will directly prevent employees from contacting them or deny these ideas. For example, if an employee wants to start a business, you have to tell him that it is very difficult to start a business, and then give him many examples, and tell him that part-time work can be very promising, and then give him\\n\\n178 Entrepreneur Business School Serving Entrepreneurs\\n\\nGive some examples.\\n\\nFor example, if your company does hard work, you take your employees to see the young and Dangerous, and fight and kill.\\n\\nTV series, movies. Donâ€™t show them something inspiring, how to do business\\n\\nWest. If you enlighten their thinking, they will stop working. To occupy their spare time\\n\\nDuring this time, I told them that it is glorious to rely on coolies to eat without letting them think about problems. The fourth step of brainwashing is the herding effect. Create a system in which everyone does this, and if you don't do it, it is wrong. Herding effect,\\n\\nAlso called unified values. There is also an academic term called \\\"crab effect\\\". That is to say, if a crab is in the bucket, he is likely to crawl out. Put a few more crabs in the bucket, and these crabs will pull each other, and finally one can not climb out of the bucket. Because one climbs up, the other will tear off.\\n\\nThe fifth stroke of brainwashing is also the ultimate move. Is to create a corporate environment completely different from the outside world, from corporate culture to corporate\\n\\nBusiness environment, even work and rest time. Let the employees working here only adapt to your working environment, and they will feel uncomfortable when they go to other places. In fact, this is also the reason why very successful companies, with great employees ran out, and he had to come back after a while. He couldn't survive because he went out. It's like you raise your employees into fish that survive in a water temperature of 38 degrees. The outside environment is 20 degrees. He went out and couldn't live, so he had to come back.\",\"timestamp\":1634800437,\"title\":\"How to brainwash employees\"},\"digest\":\"kqUgX-ttq1PvIOMhedTTsQYO02Wwoo1_Kb3H4-y0WZY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Rr4wGs1uXRmqDPOTYdkEk1x1hgVqbhRLrmHaZAx6ZJ8Q6Y0RvL4x4IkFUsMAt7EuvQiRSamb53A0cQsgMo5Fyw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kqUgX-ttq1PvIOMhedTTsQYO02Wwoo1_Kb3H4-y0WZY\"}"
