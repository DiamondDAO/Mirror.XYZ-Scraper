"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As our living standard is higher than it used to be, most people can now afford to own a car. As a result, there are too many cars in our streets.

Not that our streets are not wide enough, but that our drivers seldom obey the traffic rules. Not that we don't understand the importance of observing the traffic rules, but that we in our selfishness refuse to observe them. The urgent problem at hand is how to reduce the traffic jam. I think the only way is to obey the rules――not only the drivers but also the pedestrians. Everybody should realize that the observance of the law is the first duty of a citizen.\",\"timestamp\":1638953434,\"title\":\"There are too many cars in our streets\"},\"digest\":\"2RGXkQWzzwVEaDv3OrO1VnxSKIV_gB7q7Q1SDlRNSjE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb82497a5925Ab7Dd70C42919925BF8084815E136\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u6O68iMBZD-vCG_YVA_ijNryHZDJxcjnADgaj5A0qdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"udIMXc7h0esCN5ILi60rYmLqpc96donIfWy4Bmv4_cw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"7npwPI5_S1v5b8W9DCWqql_xHEX6fezfVd6MiaBZmsKgyWsmzsslNCTC_YdXNLwFvP3mwETffEJGXe6AqTVIKQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x09fa1355d128ec1e7b55f705bee323bc2d9d99004d09b4f0a755c151d0134011421e708260c3cf4594530383ece62bab9760e00b930854beb1e50cea9651ec4e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u6O68iMBZD-vCG_YVA_ijNryHZDJxcjnADgaj5A0qdA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"udIMXc7h0esCN5ILi60rYmLqpc96donIfWy4Bmv4_cw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"2RGXkQWzzwVEaDv3OrO1VnxSKIV_gB7q7Q1SDlRNSjE\"}"
