"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Our world revolves around our family and loved ones. We work hard, make\\nmoney, plan vacations, buy new stuff to take care of them and make them\\nhappy. \\n \\nDespite being surrounded by our loved ones, we have small gaps in our lives\\nthe little pockets of void that are filled by the 'other' people.\\n \\n Who are they? They are those whom we come across every day. They are the\\nones we rely on when we are in a hurry. We don't think about them until we\\nneed something.\\n \\n The neighborhood barber, the bank teller who helps you out every time, the\\nuncle who smiles at you when he's walking by your street every day to buy\\nmilk, the old couple who gifted a wall clock for your wedding, the tea master\\nwho knows how you like your tea, colleagues from the past company with\\nwhom you've shared a few good laughs, your plumber or electrician whom\\nyou used call during a crisis. They are a few examples of 'other' people.\\n \\n They make our life outside our home. Our world is sane because of them.\\nAnd, they're an indication that everything around us is fine.\\n \\n With the second wave of COVID, we've lost too many 'other' people from our\\nlives. People who were living and breathing became news I heard through my\\nneighbors, friends, and extended family. Even though I move through every\\nday doing my job, running errands, and dreaming about the future like nothing\\nhappened, a part of me keeps thinking about the lost lives. On one side I feel\\nselfish and thank the universe for keeping me alive and on the other hand, I\\nfeel bad for the 'other' people who were part of my life.\\n \\n We can't do much for them. But, we can keep our memories with them alive\\nby writing about them in our journals or share an an interesting story that\\ninvolves them with our friends and family. And, maybe think about all the\\nthings they've done for us when we pass by places where we've met them,\\nspoke to them, or had a good laugh. Reminisce the good times. As incapable\\nhumans, that is all we can do.\",\"timestamp\":1640664211,\"title\":\"#38 Remember The Others\"},\"digest\":\"7DPQIPNm7MDZacT9RrLJZEk-o7x8Qfd7sPc58cpzxCo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5F882566e4B071Ec1565Ed633EDBFB5c902dCA74\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cb9ePrCFLZR-4NXgsAX4SZ5NyWgJMXzcxgUycfp34tg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-uJZlFRlIbA2bDe_0rg8P0-mJO7eZ8xwXzIYqo0klzw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IJEfXe4YAfFUDDhPe8LNF6vRMojouzWOF7CQrFAmazXgvQE1hh1irZ3MvAy9DvLDORD6Xn5Mw9QZIoZDAKPA9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf271a1ca4c9bb25ddc14dfa515625cd77e5f6ed98214caf449f4d4fcb7b03ef276afdbef970f502d371f52647006f92654cbb3dd67c0ea60a9d0bc414bf44d471c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cb9ePrCFLZR-4NXgsAX4SZ5NyWgJMXzcxgUycfp34tg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-uJZlFRlIbA2bDe_0rg8P0-mJO7eZ8xwXzIYqo0klzw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"7DPQIPNm7MDZacT9RrLJZEk-o7x8Qfd7sPc58cpzxCo\"}"
