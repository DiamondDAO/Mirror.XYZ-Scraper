"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"At Voltaire, we're exploring a progressive approach to building our DAO. We're not going full-on DAO out of the gate, but instead building our guild, infrastructure, community and then leveraging those resources to build up and out.\\n\\nOur strategy aims to be an open and public work in progress guided by our team's experiences in building GitcoinDAO, resources like @coopahtroopa'sÂ [DAO Landscape](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw), and most importantly, our growing community.\\n\\nWe see community feedback as a critical coordination mechanism at the foundation, especially as the guild grows. Following in the footsteps of other successful DAOs, we're looking to surveys/questionnaires to tap the wisdom and pulse of our community.\\n\\nThe primary goal of our first community survey was to get a temperature from our scholars on how they feel about gaming with Voltaire. We also snuck some questions about DAO tech direction and P2E game support.\\n\\nWe also incentivized the survey with a healthy giveaway and social following requirement. It's important to highlight these elements when interpreting response and response rate.\\n\\n## December 2021 - Community Survey Results\\n\\n![VoltaireDAO Community Survey Results breakdown ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/WTlSpET73afnc2TO2pwSE.png?height=447&width=1116)\\n\\nIn the Voltaire realm, Embers are active Axie players in our guild. Commonly referred to as Axie Scholars.  Nearly all respondents were either active scholars, or aspiring scholars. In the next question weâ€™re probing for info on what games our scholars would like to see the guild supporting next.\\n\\n### Question # 2\\n\\n> What games do you think Voltaire should support beyond Axie Infinity?\\n\\nBecause this question wasnâ€™t multiple choice we received a lot of different answers here. After review and manual tally, the results look something like this:\\n\\n* [Theatan Arena](https://thetanarena.com/) - 10\\n* [Pegaxy](https://pegaxy.io/) - 6\\n* [Mobile Legend](https://m.mobilelegends.com/en) - 5\\n* [Bomb Crypto](https://bombcrypto.io/) - 4\\n* [Plants vs Undead](https://plantvsundead.com/) - 3\\n* [MyDeFiPet](https://mydefipet.com/) -3\\n* [League of Ancients](https://leagueofancients.com/) - 3\\n* [Illuvium](https://www.illuvium.io/) - 2\\n* [UFO Gaming](https://ufogaming.io/) - 2\\n* [The Sandbox](https://www.sandbox.game/) - 2\\n* [Binemon](https://binemon.io/) - 2\\n* [Mir4](https://mir4global.com/) -2\\n* Esports (generic) - 2\\n\\nThere were a number of other games that only got mentioned once too. Including but not limited to:\\n\\nGuild of Guardians, Monsta Infinite, HeroFi, Skyweaver, Place war, Crypto Kitties, Idle Mystic, GROWTOPIA, Crabada, Vulcan Verse, and Starships.\\n\\n### Question #3\\n\\n> What characteristics do you believe will make a play to earn guild successful?\\n\\nSome answers we really liked:\\n\\n* Unity\\n* Approachable management and Active guild community\\n* An understanding of the game, a friendly community that help each other improve and grow and generosity to the members.\\n* No toxicity\\n* Knowledgeable members\\n* **Trust Above Everything**\\n* Perseverance, dedication and fighting Spirit ðŸ™ŒðŸ”¥\\n\\n![Characteristics of a successful guild ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nsZNa1lXabE6taxHJu8zG.png?height=183&width=603)\\n\\n**A common overall theme amongst answers to this question was also patience.**\\n\\n### Question #3\\n\\n![Guild Blockchain Preference](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/EZdurjT0rKeAWd5TwiFkt.png?height=489&width=1103)\\n\\nItâ€™s worth note that the question asked you to select â€˜otherâ€™ if you wanted to specify an L2 network.  Polygon was top of the list there which would bring Etheruem up a bit more overall if we included those there.\\n\\n### Question #4\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/iBgy6HtYe3464sUNXvXQX.png?height=450&width=998)\\n\\nIt is estimated that \\\\~50% of new Play to Earn gamers are also new to crypto at this point. With that in mind the results of this question are not surprising.\\n\\nWe had a couple of other questions related to guild improvements but weâ€™ll save those for another time.\\n\\nWeâ€™re humbled and honored to be working with such a kind and dedicated team of gamers. Weâ€™re excited to incorporate the feedback from our community into Voltaire as we grown and expand into DAOhood.  As we improve and our ability to collectively think as a guild, we aim to shape our DAO with intention, inclusion, diversity, and strength.\\n\\n\\\\- Zoltar - [@WolfDefi](https://twitter.com/WolfDefi)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/HOaNdi8EsMFdgTB3rLfJH.png?height=237&width=506)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639623914,\"title\":\"Igniting VoltaireDAO & Community Survey #1 \"},\"digest\":\"DOYkJfUhejhgrHs6ZSzD5UEUNpFj1q-7JaIozPkcMoA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x95155E0b0B9cC85e67e5022824E94843af479bF6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8tPep_wM_5lND6Ecr420uGdHK62u6_N0g2rkayAsJVM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DNm5mDLt_Yu7XG8RnDcPaWR5JT4An7rnwb6t2KdQzGM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dlHbnmuccU9E25nC-ElH9oe26R6nD7-1U9h0vDFsUA29nOwtK1KebZ1K8tXCgGFsWh7Ay8pej_qIoczER17zrw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1b9bae38b1da8922f44f11166dc8b7aefcc776501a29ab10049fb42737eb6eda08cdc7750295cb495b415818367031a80cef40bd937d66d71dab16ee732601bb1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8tPep_wM_5lND6Ecr420uGdHK62u6_N0g2rkayAsJVM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"DNm5mDLt_Yu7XG8RnDcPaWR5JT4An7rnwb6t2KdQzGM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"eZDWkyJjFVvq0wIKeKEtFKz5paqj4a_KD-mbcG5XUd4\"}"
