"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"At our school , we have to wear uniforms every day. The problem is that all my classmates think the uniforms are ugly. We think young people should look smart and so we would like to wear our own clothes. Our teachers believe that if we did that. We would concentrate more on our clothes than our studies. We disagree. We should feel more comfortable and thate is good for studying. If we canâ€™t do that, we should be allowed to design our own uniforms. We also think everyone should be different from others. That would be a good way to keep both teachers and students happy.\",\"timestamp\":1639135255,\"title\":\"My view on school uniform\"},\"digest\":\"JKKD0z0qn6pte0ceU2Rub7J-Ws59TRSSNx0O-q7rDtU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x44e37520b02F2083AE1A5ce9c592f4e50F5d19e1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T6RKgRn7-GdmAD_Txdt8db9RGUaiIGg8VRzmf8fAkEE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5FXEGbx1dnpLDQAySkHqVQD5hdfnkLDpiIP058uCRkE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Qw0EHdSM6mZUezo7wIE2O9SGCWBl-Wf-wfCbn2skfCqWdbQ90Y3zH8yhjnnjEwtFZGpy1tmMoHFBMx4wXvp0tA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd2eeaef9fa23ce1077f1b9d3eea7fd5283fc19408509b152fd0ab3a4945875c3533ac5be29a49008470ee5cb03e379f053a4a7cf046b2c9db224df54f81dca461c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T6RKgRn7-GdmAD_Txdt8db9RGUaiIGg8VRzmf8fAkEE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5FXEGbx1dnpLDQAySkHqVQD5hdfnkLDpiIP058uCRkE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"JKKD0z0qn6pte0ceU2Rub7J-Ws59TRSSNx0O-q7rDtU\"}"
