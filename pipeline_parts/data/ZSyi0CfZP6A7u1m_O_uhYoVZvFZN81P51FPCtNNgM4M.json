"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Many people are inclined to do one job in their lives. In their opinions, people who change their jobs frequently are superficial and tactless. They believe that the only way to success is to stick to one job, because constant practice in a professional field helps make an expert.\\n\\nBut there are still many people who donâ€™t agree. They argue that change means progress. If you are not satisfied with your present job or you have some better opportunities, of course you have the right to replace it with a more challenging and better paid one. This idea may be the reason why they change their jobs so often.\\n\\nFor my part, I think it reasonable to change your job if you have a better opportunity. But once you have found a position where you can fully display your ability, it is advisable to settle down to it and put all your efforts into it. Only in this way, can you get the true joy of achieving your goal and improving your capability.              \",\"timestamp\":1641042259,\"title\":\"My View on Job-hopping\"},\"digest\":\"yDZ3W1VdUN4N9SgRAR5mvM3jAqhmSB7u_QAXulnsuRI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4f6819e5fD72F9F9827eEf36cC0d355552aDFaE4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eXmvcmnFwf7d_PYNCy4XHOzrccZhLK9WrbjDlYsCHkM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"s9MYc7m4Ffh4-m1O59eBd6To0N-7v8SN5wUIb0M1dBM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TR7DsnXv8k6nhi03o595rR-uu2CHPYfjkRehj5gk4Vi8VJC_fpiCnn6g_ewj8aX5PzU0kpr6srTFFGH1v_y51g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x71664e152ebcc059eeca26d5205e7a1e43108ba8a6ba75d102fb32531b2949021ec35be1c742308a4e1724395ee8872f02f2dddc9be8435cb6d612c03cf71fbf1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eXmvcmnFwf7d_PYNCy4XHOzrccZhLK9WrbjDlYsCHkM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"s9MYc7m4Ffh4-m1O59eBd6To0N-7v8SN5wUIb0M1dBM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"yDZ3W1VdUN4N9SgRAR5mvM3jAqhmSB7u_QAXulnsuRI\"}"
