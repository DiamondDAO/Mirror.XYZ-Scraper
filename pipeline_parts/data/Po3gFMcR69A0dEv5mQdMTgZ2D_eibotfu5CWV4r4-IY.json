"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"Poor Jon!  Why didn't you tell me, Father?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I never know!\\\" said Soames slowly; \\\"you don't confide in me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I would, if you'd help me, dear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps I shall.\\\"\\n\\nFleur clasped her hands.  \\\"Oh! darling--when one wants a thing fearfully, one doesn't think of other people.  Don't be angry with me.\\\"\\n\\nSoames put out his hand, as if pushing away an aspersion.\\n\\n\\\"I'm cogitating,\\\" he said.  What on earth had made him use a word like that!  \\\"Has young Mont been bothering you again?\\\"\\n\\nFleur smiled.  \\\"Oh! Michael!  He's always bothering; but he's such a good sort--I don't mind him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well,\\\" said Soames, \\\"I'm tired; I shall go and have a nap before dinner.\\\"\\n\\nHe went up to his picture-gallery, lay down on the couch there, and closed his eyes.  A terrible responsibility this girl of his--whose mother was--ah! what was she?  A terrible responsibility!  Help her-- how could he help her?  He could not alter the fact that he was her father.  Or that Irene--!  What was it young Mont had said--some nonsense about the possessive instinct--shutters up-- To let?  Silly!\\n\\nThe sultry air, charged with a scent of meadow-sweet, of river and roses, closed on his senses, drowsing them.\\n\\nV\\n\\nTHE FIXED IDEA\\n\\nThe fixed idea,\\\" which has outrun more constables than any other form of human disorder, has never more speed and stamina than when it takes the avid guise of love.  To hedges and ditches, and doors, to humans without ideas fixed or otherwise, to perambulators and the contents sucking their fixed ideas, even to the other sufferers from this fast malady--the fixed idea of love pays no attention.  It runs with eyes turned inward to its own light, oblivious of all other stars.  Those with the fixed ideas that human happiness depends on their art, on vivisecting dogs, on hating foreigners, on paying supertax, on remaining Ministers, on making wheels go round, on preventing their neighbours from being divorced, on conscientious objection, Greek roots, Church dogma, paradox and superiority to everybody else, with other forms of ego-mania--all are unstable compared with him or her whose fixed idea is the possession of some her or him.  And though Fleur, those chilly summer days, pursued the scattered life of a little Forsyte whose frocks are paid for, and whose business is pleasure, she was--as Winifred would have said in the latest fashion of speech--\\\"honest to God\\\" indifferent to it all. She wished and wished for the moon, which sailed in cold skies above the river or the Green Park when she went to Town.  She even kept Jon's letters, covered with pink silk, on her heart, than which in days when corsets were so low, sentiment so despised, and chests so out of fashion, there could, perhaps, have been no greater proof of the fixity of her idea.\\n\\nAfter hearing of his father's death, she wrote to Jon, and received his answer three days later on her return from a river picnic.  It was his first letter since their meeting at June's.  She opened it with misgiving, and read it with dismay.\\n\\n\\\"Since I saw you I've heard everything about the past.  I won't tell it you--I think you knew when we met at June's.  She says you did. If you did, Fleur, you ought to have told me.  I expect you only heard your father's side of it.  I have heard my mother's.  It's dreadful.  Now that she's so sad I can't do anything to hurt her more.  Of course, I long for you all day, but I don't believe now that we shall ever come together--there's something too strong pulling us apart.\\\"\\n\\nSo!  Her deception had found her out.  But Jon--she felt--had forgiven that.  It was what he said of his mother which caused the guttering in her heart and the weak sensation in her legs.\\n\\nHer first impulse was to reply--her second, not to reply.  These impulses were constantly renewed in the days which followed, while desperation grew within her.  She was not her father's child for nothing.  The tenacity which had at once made and undone Soames was her backbone, too, frilled and embroidered by French grace and quickness.  Instinctively she conjugated the verb \\\"to have\\\" always with the pronoun \\\"I.\\\"  She concealed, however, all signs of her growing desperation, and pursued such river pleasures as the winds and rain of a disagreeable July permitted, as if she had no care in the world; nor did any \\\"sucking baronet\\\" ever neglect the business of a publisher more consistently than her attendant spirit, Michael Mont.\\n\\nTo Soames she was a puzzle.  He was almost deceived by this careless gaiety.  Almost--because he did not fail to mark her eyes often fixed on nothing, and the film of light shining from her bedroom window late at night.  What was she thinking and brooding over into small hours when she ought to have been asleep?  But he dared not ask what was in her mind; and, since that one little talk in the billiard- room, she said nothing to him.\\n\\nIn this taciturn condition of affairs it chanced that Winifred invited them to lunch and to go afterward to \\\"a most amusing little play, 'The Beggar's Opera\\\"' and would they bring a man to make four? Soames, whose attitude toward theatres was to go to nothing, accepted, because Fleur's attitude was to go to everything.  They motored up, taking Michael Mont, who, being in his seventh heaven, was found by Winifred \\\"very amusing.\\\"  \\\"The Beggar's Opera\\\" puzzled Soames.  The people were very unpleasant, the whole thing very cynical.  Winifred was \\\"intrigued \\\"--by the dresses.  The music, too, did not displease her.  At the Opera, the night before, she had arrived too early for the Russian Ballet, and found the stage occupied by singers, for a whole hour pale or apoplectic from terror lest by some dreadful inadvertence they might drop into a tune. Michael Mont was enraptured with the whole thing.  And all three wondered what Fleur was thinking of it.  But Fleur was not thinking of it.  Her fixed idea stood on the stage and sang with Polly Peachum, mimed with Filch, danced with Jenny Diver, postured with Lucy Lockit, kissed, trolled, and cuddled with Macheath.  Her lips might smile, her hands applaud, but the comic old masterpiece made no more impression on her than if it had been pathetic, like a modern \\\"Revue.\\\"  When they embarked in the car to return, she ached because Jon was not sitting next her instead of Michael Mont.  When, at some jolt, the young man's arm touched hers as if by accident, she only thought: 'If that were Jon's arm!'  When his cheerful voice, tempered by her proximity, murmured above the sound of the car's progress, she smiled and answered, thinking: 'If that were Jon's voice!' and when once he said, \\\"Fleur, you look a perfect angel in that dress!\\\" she answered, \\\"Oh, do you like it? thinking, 'If only Jon could see it!'\\n\\nDuring this drive she took a resolution.  She would go to Robin Hill and see him--alone; she would take the car, without word beforehand to him or to her father.  It was nine days since his letter, and she could wait no longer.  On Monday she would go!  The decision made her well disposed toward young Mont.  With something to look forward to she could afford to tolerate and respond.  He might stay to dinner; propose to her as usual; dance with her, press her hand, sigh--do what he liked.  He was only a nuisance when he interfered with her fixed idea.  She was even sorry for him so far as it was possible to be sorry for anybody but herself just now.  At dinner he seemed to talk more wildly than usual about what he called \\\"the death of the close borough\\\"--she paid little attention, but her father seemed paying a good deal, with the smile on his face which meant opposition, if not anger.\\n\\n\\\"The younger generation doesn't think as you do, sir; does it, Fleur?\\\"\\n\\nFleur shrugged her shoulders--the younger generation was just Jon, and she did not know what he was thinking.\\n\\n\\\"Young people will think as I do when they're my age, Mr. Mont. Human nature doesn't change.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I admit that, sir; but the forms of thought change with the times. The pursuit of self-interest is a form of thought that's going out.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Indeed!  To mind one's own business is not a form of thought, Mr. Mont, it's an instinct.\\\"\\n\\nYes, when Jon was the business!\\n\\n\\\"But what is one's business, sir?  That's the point.  Everybody's business is going to be one's business.  Isn't it, Fleur?\\\"\\n\\nFleur only smiled.\\n\\n\\\"If not,\\\" added young Mont, \\\"there'll be blood.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"People have talked like that from time immemorial\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you'll admit, sir, that the sense of property is dying out?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should say increasing among those who have none.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, look at me!  I'm heir to an entailed estate.  I don't want the thing; I'd cut the entail to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You're not married, and you don't know what you're talking about.\\\"\\n\\nFleur saw the young man's eyes turn rather piteously upon her.\\n\\n\\\"Do you really mean that marriage--?\\\" he began.\\n\\n\\\"Society is built on marriage,\\\" came from between her father's close lips; \\\"marriage and its consequences.  Do you want to do away with it?\\\"\\n\\nYoung Mont made a distracted gesture.  Silence brooded over the dinner table, covered with spoons bearing the Forsyte crest--a pheasant proper--under the electric light in an alabaster globe.  And outside, the river evening darkened, charged with heavy moisture and sweet scents.\\n\\n'Monday,' thought Fleur; 'Monday!'\\n\\nVI\\n\\nDESPERATE\\n\\nThe weeks which followed the death of his father were sad and empty to the only Jolyon Forsyte left.  The necessary forms and ceremonies- -the reading of the Will, valuation of the estate, distribution of the legacies--were enacted over the head, as it were, of one not yet of age.  Jolyon was cremated.  By his special wish no one attended that ceremony, or wore black for him.  The succession of his property, controlled to some extent by old Jolyon's Will, left his widow in possession of Robin Hill, with two thousand five hundred pounds a year for life.  Apart from this the two Wills worked together in some complicated way to insure that each of Jolyon's three children should have an equal share in their grandfather's and father's property in the future as in the present, save only that Jon, by virtue of his sex, would have control of his capital when he was twenty-one, while June and Holly would only have the spirit of theirs, in order that their children might have the body after them. If they had no children, it would all come to Jon if he outlived them; and since June was fifty, and Holly nearly forty, it was considered in Lincoln's Inn Fields that but for the cruelty of income tax, young Jon would be as warm a man as his grandfather when he died.  All this was nothing to Jon, and little enough to his mother. It was June who did everything needful for one who had left his affairs in perfect order.  When she had gone, and those two were alone again in the great house, alone with death drawing them together, and love driving them apart, Jon passed very painful days secretly disgusted and disappointed with himself.  His mother would look at him with such a patient sadness which yet had in it an instinctive pride, as if she were reserving her defence.  If she smiled he was angry that his answering smile should be so grudging and unnatural.  He did not judge or condemn her; that was all too remote--indeed, the idea of doing so had never come to him.  No! he was grudging and unnatural because he couldn't have what he wanted be cause of her.  There was one alleviation--much to do in connection with his father's career, which could not be safely entrusted to June, though she had offered to undertake it.  Both Jon and his mother had felt that if she took his portfolios, unexhibited drawings and unfinished matter, away with her, the work would encounter such icy blasts from Paul Post and other frequenters of her studio, that it would soon be frozen out even of her warm heart.  On its old- fashioned plane and of its kind the work was good, and they could not bear the thought of its subjection to ridicule.  A one-man exhibition of his work was the least testimony they could pay to one they had loved; and on preparation for this they spent many hours together. Jon came to have a curiously increased respect for his father.  The quiet tenacity with which he had converted a mediocre talent into something really individual was disclosed by these researches.  There was a great mass of work with a rare continuity of growth in depth and reach of vision.  Nothing certainly went very deep, or reached very high--but such as the work was, it was thorough, conscientious, and complete.  And, remembering his father's utter absence of \\\"side\\\" or self-assertion, the chaffing humility with which he had always spoken of his own efforts, ever calling himself \\\"an amateur,\\\" Jon could not help feeling that he had never really known his father.  To  take himself seriously, yet never bore others by letting them know that he did so, seemed to have been his ruling principle.  There was something in this which appealed to the boy, and made him heartily endorse his mother's comment: \\\"He had true refinement; he couldn't help thinking of others, whatever he did.  And when he took a resolution which went counter, he did it with the minimum of defiance--not like the Age, is it?  Twice in his life he had to go against everything; and yet it never made him bitter.\\\"  Jon saw tears running down her face, which she at once turned away from him.  She was so quiet about her loss that sometimes he had thought she didn't feel it much.  Now, as he looked at her, he felt how far he fell short of the reserve power and dignity in both his father and his mother.  And, stealing up to her, he put his arm round her waist. She kissed him swiftly, but with a sort of passion, and went out of the room.\\n\\nThe studio, where they had been sorting and labelling, had once been Holly's schoolroom, devoted to her silkworms, dried lavender, music, and other forms of instruction.  Now, at the end of July, despite its northern and eastern aspects, a warm and slumberous air came in between the long-faded lilac linen curtains.  To redeem a little the departed glory, as of a field that is golden and gone, clinging to a room which its master has left, Irene had placed on the paint-stained table a bowl of red roses.  This, and Jolyon's favourite cat, who still clung to the deserted habitat, were the pleasant spots in that dishevelled, sad workroom.  Jon, at the north window, sniffing air mysteriously scented with warm strawberries, heard a car drive up. The lawyers again about some nonsense!  Why did that scent so make one ache?  And where did it come from--there were no strawberry beds on this side of the house.  Instinctively he took a crumpled sheet of paper from his pocket, and wrote down some broken words.  A warmth began spreading in his chest; he rubbed the palms of his hands together.  Presently he had jotted this:\\n\\n\\\"If I could make a little song A little song to soothe my heart! I'd make it all of little things The plash of water, rub of wings, The puffing-off of dandies crown, The hiss of raindrop spilling down, The purr of cat, the trill of bird, And ev'ry whispering I've heard >From willy wind in leaves and grass, And all the distant drones that pass. A song as tender and as light As flower, or butterfly in flight; And when I saw it opening, I'd let it fly and sing!\\\"\\n\\nHe was still muttering it over to himself at the window, when he heard his name called, and, turning round, saw Fleur.  At that amazing apparition, he made at first no movement and no sound, while her clear vivid glance ravished his heart.  Then he went forward to the table, saying, \\\"How nice of you to come!\\\" and saw her flinch as if he had thrown something at her.\\n\\n\\\"I asked for you,\\\" she said, \\\"and they showed me up here.  But I can go away again.\\\"\\n\\nJon clutched the paint-stained table.  Her face and figure in its frilly frock photographed itself with such startling vividness upon his eyes, that if she had sunk through the floor he must still have seen her.\\n\\n\\\"I know I told you a lie, Jon.  But I told it out of love.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, oh! yes! That's nothing!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I didn't answer your letter.  What was the use--there wasn't anything to answer.  I wanted to see you instead.\\\"  She held out both her hands, and Jon grasped them across the table.  He tried to say something, but all his attention was given to trying not to hurt her hands.  His own felt so hard and hers so soft.  She said almost defiantly:\\n\\n\\\"That old story--was it so very dreadful?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"  In his voice, too, there was a note of defiance.\\n\\nShe dragged her hands away.  \\\"I didn't think in these days boys were tied to their mothers' apron-strings.\\\"\\n\\nJon's chin went up as if he had been struck.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! I didn't mean it, Jon.  What a horrible thing to say!\\\"  Swiftly she came close to him.  \\\"Jon, dear; I didn't mean it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All right.\\\"\\n\\nShe had put her two hands on his shoulder, and her forehead down on them; the brim of her hat touched his neck, and he felt it quivering. But, in a sort of paralysis, he made no response.  She let go of his shoulder and drew away.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'll go, if you don't want me.  But I never thought you'd have given me up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I haven't,\\\" cried Jon, coming suddenly to life.  \\\"I can't.  I'll try again.\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes gleamed, she swayed toward him.  \\\"Jon--I love you!  Don't give me up!  If you do, I don't know what--I feel so desperate.  What does it matter--all that past-compared with this?\\\"\\n\\nShe clung to him.  He kissed her eyes, her cheeks, her lips.  But while he kissed her he saw, the sheets of that letter fallen down on the floor of his bedroom--his father's white dead face--his mother kneeling before it.  Fleur's whispered, \\\"Make her!  Promise! Oh! Jon, try!\\\" seemed childish in his ear.  He felt curiously old.\\n\\n\\\"I promise!\\\" he muttered.  \\\"Only, you don't understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She wants to spoil our lives, just because--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, of what?\\\"\\n\\nAgain that challenge in his voice, and she did not answer.  Her arms tightened round him, and he returned her kisses; but even while he yielded, the poison worked in him, the poison of the letter.  Fleur did not know, she did not understand--she misjudged his mother; she came from the enemy's camp!  So lovely, and he loved her so--yet, even in her embrace, he could not help the memory of Holly's words: \\\"I think she has a 'having' nature,\\\" and his mother's \\\"My darling boy, don't think of me--think of yourself!\\\"\\n\\nWhen she was gone like a passionate dream, leaving her image on his eyes, her kisses on his lips, such an ache in his heart, Jon leaned in the window, listening to the car bearing her away.  Still the scent as of warm strawberries, still the little summer sounds that should make his song; still all the promise of youth and happiness in sighing, floating, fluttering July--and his heart torn; yearning strong in him; hope high in him yet with its eyes cast down, as if ashamed.  The miserable task before him!  If Fleur was desperate, so was he--watching the poplars swaying, the white clouds passing, the sunlight on the grass.\\n\\nHe waited till evening, till after their almost silent dinner, till his mother had played to him and still he waited, feeling that she knew what he was waiting to say.  She kissed him and went up-stairs, and still he lingered, watching the moonlight and the moths, and that unreality of colouring which steals along and stains a summer night. And he would have given anything to be back again in the past--barely three months back; or away forward, years, in the future.  The present with this dark cruelty of a decision, one way or the other, seemed impossible.  He realised now so much more keenly what his mother felt than he had at first; as if the story in that letter had been a poisonous germ producing a kind of fever of partisanship, so that he really felt there were two camps, his mother's and his-- Fleur's and her father's.  It might be a dead thing, that old tragic ownership and enmity, but dead things were poisonous till time had cleaned them away.  Even his love felt tainted, less illusioned, more of the earth, and with a treacherous lurking doubt lest Fleur, like her father, might want to own; not articulate, just a stealing haunt, horribly unworthy, which crept in and about the ardour of his memories, touched with its tarnishing breath the vividness and grace of that charmed face and figure--a doubt, not real enough to convince him of its presence, just real enough to deflower a perfect faith. And perfect faith, to Jon, not yet twenty, was essential.  He still had Youth's eagerness to give with both hands, to take with neither - to give lovingly to one who had his own impulsive generosity.  Surely she had!  He got up from the window-seat and roamed in the big grey ghostly room, whose walls were hung with silvered canvas.  This house his father said in that death-bed letter--had been built for his mother to live in--with Fleur's father!  He put out his hand in the half-dark, as if to grasp the shadowy hand of the dead.  He clenched, trying to feel the thin vanished fingers of his father; to squeeze them, and reassure him that he-he was on his father's side.  Tears, prisoned within him, made his eyes feel dry and hot.  He went back to the window.  It was warmer, not so eerie, more comforting outside, where the moon hung golden, three days off full; the freedom of the night was comforting.  If only Fleur and he had met on some desert island without a past--and Nature for their house!  Jon had still his high regard for desert islands, where breadfruit grew, and the water was blue above the coral.  The night was deep, was free--there was enticement in it; a lure, a promise, a refuge from entanglement, and love!  Milksop tied to his mother's...! His cheeks burned.  He shut the window, drew curtains over it, switched off the lighted sconce, and went up-stairs.\\n\\nThe door of his room was open, the light turned up; his mother, still in her evening gown, was standing at the window.  She turned and said:\\n\\n\\\"Sit down, Jon; let's talk.\\\"  She sat down on the window-seat, Jon on his bed.  She had her profile turned to him, and the beauty and grace of her figure, the delicate line of the brow, the nose, the neck, the strange and as it were remote refinement of her, moved him.  His mother never belonged to her surroundings.  She came into them from somewhere--as it were!  What was she going to say to him, who had in his heart such things to say to her?\\n\\n\\\"I know Fleur came to-day.  I'm not surprised.\\\"  It was as though she had added: \\\"She is her father's daughter!\\\"  And Jon's heart hardened. Irene went on quietly:\\n\\n\\\"I have Father's letter.  I picked it up that night and kept it. Would you like it back, dear?\\\"\\n\\nJon shook his head.\\n\\n\\\"I had read it, of course, before he gave it to you.  It didn't quite do justice to my criminality.\\\"\\n\\n'Mother!\\\" burst from Jon's lips.\\n\\n\\\"He put it very sweetly, but I know that in marrying Fleur's father without love I did a dreadful thing.  An unhappy marriage, Jon, can play such havoc with other lives besides one's own.  You are fearfully young, my darling, and fearfully loving.  Do you think you can possibly be happy with this girl?\\\"\\n\\nStaring at her dark eyes, darker now from pain, Jon answered\\n\\n\\\"Yes; oh!  yes--if you could be.\\\"\\n\\nIrene smiled.\\n\\n\\\"Admiration of beauty and longing for possession are not love.  If yours were another case like mine, Jon--where the deepest things are stifled; the flesh joined, and the spirit at war!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should it, Mother?  You think she must be like her father, but she's not.  I've seen him.\\\"\\n\\nAgain the smile came on Irene's lips, and in Jon something wavered; there was such irony and experience in that smile.\\n\\n\\\"You are a giver, Jon; she is a taker.\\\"\\n\\nThat unworthy doubt, that haunting uncertainty again!  He said with vehemence:\\n\\n\\\"She isn't--she isn't.  It's only because I can't bear to make you unhappy, Mother, now that Father--\\\"  He thrust his fists against his forehead.\\n\\nIrene got up.\\n\\n\\\"I told you that night, dear, not to mind me.  I meant it.  Think of yourself and your own happiness!  I can stand what's left--I've brought it on myself.\\\"\\n\\nAgain the word \\\"Mother!\\\" burst from Jon's lips.\\n\\nShe came over to him and put her hands over his.\\n\\n\\\"Do you feel your head, darling?\\\"\\n\\nJon shook it.  What he felt was in his chest--a sort of tearing asunder of the tissue there, by the two loves.\\n\\n\\\"I shall always love you the same, Jon, whatever you do.  You won't lose anything.\\\"  She smoothed his hair gently, and walked away.\\n\\nHe heard the door shut; and, rolling over on the bed, lay, stifling his breath, with an awful held-up feeling within him.\\n\\nVII\\n\\nEMBASSY\\n\\nEnquiring for her at tea time Soames learned that Fleur had been out in the car since two.  Three hours!  Where had she gone?  Up to London without a word to him?  He had never become quite reconciled with cars.  He had embraced them in principle--like the born empiricist, or Forsyte, that he was--adopting each symptom of progress as it came along with: \\\"Well, we couldn't do without them now.\\\"  But in fact he found them tearing, great, smelly things. Obliged by Annette to have one--a Rollhard with pearl-grey cushions, electric light, little mirrors, trays for the ashes of cigarettes, flower vases--all smelling of petrol and stephanotis--he regarded it much as he used to regard his brother-in-law, Montague Dartie.  The thing typified all that was fast, insecure, and subcutaneously oily in modern life.  As modern life became faster, looser, younger, Soames was becoming older, slower, tighter, more and more in thought and language like his father James before him.  He was almost aware of it himself.  Pace and progress pleased him less and less; there was an ostentation, too, about a car which he considered provocative in the prevailing mood of Labour.  On one occasion that fellow Sims had driven over the only vested interest of a working man.  Soames had not forgotten the behaviour of its master, when not many people would have stopped to put up with it.  He had been sorry for the dog, and quite prepared to take its part against the car, if that ruffian hadn't been so outrageous.  With four hours fast becoming five, and still no Fleur, all the old car-wise feelings he had experienced in person and by proxy balled within him, and sinking sensations troubled the pit of his stomach.  At seven he telephoned to Winifred by trunk call.  No!  Fleur had not been to Green Street.  Then where was she?  Visions of his beloved daughter rolled up in her pretty frills, all blood and dust-stained, in some hideous catastrophe, began to haunt him.  He went to her room and spied among her things. She had taken nothing--no dressing-case, no Jewellery.  And this, a relief in one sense, increased his fears of an accident.  Terrible to be helpless when his loved one was missing, especially when he couldn't bear fuss or publicity of any kind!  What should he do if she were not back by nightfall?\\n\\nAt a quarter to eight he heard the car.  A great weight lifted from off his heart; he hurried down.  She was getting out--pale and tired- looking, but nothing wrong.  He met her in the hall.\\n\\n\\\"You've frightened me.  Where have you been?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To Robin Hill.  I'm sorry, dear.  I had to go; I'll tell you afterward.\\\"  And, with a flying kiss, she ran up-stairs.\\n\\nSoames waited in the drawing-room.  To Robin Hill!  What did that portend?\\n\\nIt was not a subject they could discuss at dinner--consecrated to the susceptibilities of the butler.  The agony of nerves Soames had been through, the relief he felt at her safety, softened his power to condemn what she had done, or resist what she was going to do; he waited in a relaxed stupor for her revelation.  Life was a queer business.  There he was at sixty-five and no more in command of things than if he had not spent forty years in building up security- always something one couldn't get on terms with!  In the pocket of his dinner-jacket was a letter from Annette.  She was coming back in a fortnight.  He knew nothing of what she had been doing out there. And he was glad that he did not.  Her absence had been a relief.  Out of sight was out of mind!  And now she was coming back.  Another worry!  And the Bolderby Old Crome was gone--Dumetrius had got it-- all because that anonymous letter had put it out of his thoughts.  He furtively remarked the strained look on his daughter's face, as if she too were gazing at a picture that she couldn't buy.  He almost wished the War back.  Worries didn't seem, then, quite so worrying. >From the caress in her voice, the look on her face, he became certain that she wanted something from him, uncertain whether it would be wise of him to give it her.  He pushed his savoury away uneaten, and even joined her in a cigarette.\\n\\nAfter dinner she set the electric piano-player going.  And he augured the worst when she sat down on a cushion footstool at his knee, and put her hand on his.\\n\\n\\\"Darling, be nice to me.  I had to see Jon--he wrote to me.  He's going to try what he can do with his mother.  But I've been thinking. It's really in your hands, Father.  If you'd persuade her that it doesn't mean renewing the past in any way!  That I shall stay yours, and Jon will stay hers; that you need never see him or her, and she need never see you or me!  Only you could persuade her, dear, because only you could promise.  One can't promise for other people.  Surely it wouldn't be too awkward for you to see her just this once now that Jon's father is dead?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Too awkward?\\\" Soames repeated.  \\\"The whole thing's preposterous.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know,\\\" said Fleur, without looking up, \\\"you wouldn't mind seeing her, really.\\\"\\n\\nSoames was silent.  Her words had expressed a truth too deep for him to admit.  She slipped her fingers between his own--hot, slim, eager, they clung there.  This child of his would corkscrew her way into a brick wall!\\n\\n\\\"What am I to do if you won't, Father?\\\" she said very softly.\\n\\n\\\"I'll do anything for your happiness,\\\" said Soanies; \\\"but this isn't for your happiness.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! it is; it is!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It'll only stir things up,\\\" he said grimly.\\n\\n\\\"But they are stirred up.  The thing is to quiet them.  To make her feel that this is just our lives, and has nothing to do with yours or hers.  You can do it, Father, I know you can.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know a great deal, then,\\\" was Soames' glum answer.\\n\\n\\\"If you will, Jon and I will wait a year--two years if you like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seems to me,\\\" murmured Soames, \\\"that you care nothing about what I feel.\\\"\\n\\nFleur pressed his hand against her cheek.\\n\\n\\\"I do, darling.  But you wouldn't like me to be awfully miserable.\\\"\\n\\nHow she wheedled to get her ends!  And trying with all his might to think she really cared for him--he was not sure--not sure.  All she cared for was this boy!  Why should he help her to get this boy, who was killing her affection for himself?  Why should he?  By the laws of the Forsytes it was foolish!  There was nothing to be had out of it--nothing!  To give her to that boy!  To pass her into the enemy's camp, under the influence of the woman who had injured him so deeply! Slowly--inevitably--he would lose this flower of his life!  And suddenly he was conscious that his hand was wet.  His heart gave a little painful jump.  He couldn't bear her to cry.  He put his other hand quickly over hers, and a tear dropped on that, too.  He couldn't go on like this!  \\\"Well, well,\\\" he said, \\\"I'll think it over, and do what I can.  Come, come!\\\"  If she must have it for her happiness--she must; he couldn't refuse to help her.  And lest she should begin to thank him he got out of his chair and went up to the piano-player-- making that noise!  It ran down, as he reached it, with a faint buzz. That musical box of his nursery days: \\\"The Harmonious Blacksmith,\\\" \\\"Glorious Port\\\"--the thing had always made him miserable when his mother set it going on Sunday afternoons.  Here it was again--the same thing, only larger, more expensive, and now it played \\\"The Wild, Wild Women,\\\" and \\\"The Policeman's Holiday,\\\" and he was no longer in black velvet with a sky blue collar.  'Profond's right,' he thought, 'there's nothing in it!  We're all progressing to the grave!'  And with that surprising mental comment he walked out.\\n\\nHe did not see Fleur again that night.  But, at breakfast, her eyes followed him about with an appeal he could not escape--not that he intended to try.  No!  He had made up his mind to the nerve-racking business.  He would go to Robin Hill--to that house of memories. Pleasant memory--the last!  Of going down to keep that boy's father and Irene apart by threatening divorce.  He had often thought, since, that it had clinched their union.  And, now, he was going to clinch the union of that boy with his girl.  'I don't know what I've done,' he thought, 'to have such things thrust on me!'  He went up by train and down by train, and from the station walked by the long rising lane, still very much as he remembered it over thirty years ago. Funny--so near London!  Some one evidently was holding on to the land there.  This speculation soothed him, moving between the high hedges slowly, so as not to get overheated, though the day was chill enough. After all was said and done there was something real about land, it didn't shift.  Land, and good pictures!  The values might fluctuate a bit, but on the whole they were always going up--worth holding on to, in a world where there was such a lot of unreality, cheap building, changing fashions, such a \\\"Here to-day and gone to-morrow\\\" spirit. The French were right, perhaps, with their peasant proprietorship, though he had no opinion of the French.  One's bit of land! Something solid in it!  He had heard peasant proprietors described as a pig-headed lot; had heard young Mont call his father a pigheaded Morning Poster--disrespectful young devil.  Well, there were worse things than being pig-headed or reading the Morning Post.  There was Profond and his tribe, and all these Labour chaps, and loud-mouthed politicians and 'wild, wild women'!  A lot of worse things!  And suddenly Soames became conscious of feeling weak, and hot, and shaky. Sheer nerves at the meeting before him!  As Aunt Juley might have said--quoting \\\"Superior Dosset\\\"--his nerves were \\\"in a proper fautigue.\\\"  He could see the house now among its trees, the house he had watched being built, intending it for himself and this woman, who, by such strange fate, had lived in it with another after all! He began to think of Dumetrius, Local Loans, and other forms of investment.  He could not afford to meet her with his nerves all shaking; he who represented the Day of Judgment for her on earth as it was in heaven; he, legal ownership, personified, meeting lawless beauty, incarnate.  His dignity demanded impassivity during this embassy designed to link their offspring, who, if she had behaved herself, would have been brother and sister.  That wretched tune, \\\"The Wild, Wild Women,\\\" kept running in his head, perversely, for tunes did not run there as a rule.  Passing the poplars in front of the house, he thought: 'How they've grown; I had them planted!' A maid answered his ring.\\n\\n\\\"Will you say--Mr. Forsyte, on a very special matter.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639990509,\"title\":\"\\nIn her startled, frowning face he saw the instant struggle to apprehend what this would mean.\"},\"digest\":\"l1ZPuukNgn82b_ypMgUQZL6rKk29SyamBJvszLklWCE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x755Bda80E984cd5fAabcbf90e065196EEDb3214A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ntX1hGwJcabCTeMgen--uici_hD2colLEAfRatpeSDo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gsPM2VPBJxHyKtRYDUYMJbnBg6qYtyaizBVgOWlkZ6A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"bK0OzcIBcM6ER7Aq8EokehWVu_W-gHFFAkySsY1xMqAx-3NH6UaN-1YljXAgILrbRJ3eg05UWi1vuQWRdxqBkw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x17e7a314190e9bd44a396a7efb0a5e23897d0ef5a3540ec71dbac89ae3b70f9802d12f5a6a56fff672a99733a9439e6c7c1e439295e1508071a9fe5c696f34ae1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ntX1hGwJcabCTeMgen--uici_hD2colLEAfRatpeSDo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"gsPM2VPBJxHyKtRYDUYMJbnBg6qYtyaizBVgOWlkZ6A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l1ZPuukNgn82b_ypMgUQZL6rKk29SyamBJvszLklWCE\"}"
