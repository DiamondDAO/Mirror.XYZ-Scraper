"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1904, Paris**\\n\\nHenri Matisse wished for “a small syndicate that would give me enough money to work for a year\\\".\\n\\nAndré Level, lawyer from a respected family of industrialists, raised a fund to buy a collection of work from emerging and unappreciated artists. Art in the eyes of some, bizarre trash to many - opportunity for Level.\\n\\nGauguin, Matisse, Picasso, and van Gogh were among the 60 artists in 145 works which \\\"La Peau de l’Ours\\\", \\\"Skin of the Bear\\\", bought in 1904. The sale in a dreary auction house in March 1914, was for quadruple the investment. Profits shared with the artists.\\n\\n**2911 Mars**\\n\\nElena was hunched over her host like a crumpled radio tower over a grand mansion. The nanos in her body would help adjust to gravity but they couldn't stop her blushing.\\n\\nFor all of her imaginative powers, Elena didn't know what to say. Her face burned as she stood up.\\n\\nThe woman sitting on the floor, brushed herself off, sweeped her virtual plumage smooth, and looked up at Elena. Eyes locked with eyes. Elena wanted to run back to the transport. The woman laughed. Elena, knocked out of her terror and embarrassment, began to laugh too.\\n\\n\\\"Come help me up, Elena. You'll get used to many things, including the local \\\"well\\\".\\\" smiled the Grand Lady of Expees. She was delighted with her latest protege. Many lokens, local tokens, were minted and burned, to promote her latest and greatest discovery.\\n\\n\\\"Elena, let's get you ready. A major event arranged at the Crystal Palace. Top level Oracles will cover and upchain the proceedings. Afterparties to prepare for. Those lovely projects of yours, from back home, will be official expees and drops minted in your honor. Walletcores will flow with lokens. Don't worry about your family, everything taken care of. You focus on fun!\\\" Fernanda Marie-Therese Roque gripped Elena’s hand as they walked.\\n\\nThe only thing Elena focused on was walking, she did not want to trip and fall on her host again.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tIT16W-o1YaZ4h7BOfzKo.png?height=2400&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633830639,\"title\":\"1648: 4.2 Tokens Of Esteem, 2911\"},\"digest\":\"kQ3WrQgVqWQQAgydKyQtJZ5h9OuFNweBb23XYnNu7zM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"U_49HFB48g2UEf1tKQQkTHQsB2edK8ZP38jWSvkXepid7Cw2Cc0vqEA6N50bWJ7AvPn2gxj2a3l872uifzfH-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kQ3WrQgVqWQQAgydKyQtJZ5h9OuFNweBb23XYnNu7zM\"}"
