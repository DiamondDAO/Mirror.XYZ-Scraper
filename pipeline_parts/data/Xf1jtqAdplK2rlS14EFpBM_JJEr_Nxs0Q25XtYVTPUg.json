"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## GM\\n\\nIt has been difficult for me to sit down and write this end of the year edition. When I crossed the finish line after completing 140.6 miles of swimming, biking, and running the feeling was underwhelming. There was nothing. I felt no feeling of accomplishment, no happiness, no anger, no type of emotional response. I continued to think about this for weeks afterward. What was it? I shared my thoughts with others and the people I trained with over the last year to find a resolution. My active recovery suffered. I didn't want to work out. My motivation suffered. What happened? \\n\\nIt took several weeks until I came to my conclusion. The race was a culmination of the 400 hours and 4,000 miles I put in but it wasn't getting the honor to be called an IRONMAN. It was the time I put in, the sacrifices I made, the people I got to meet, and what I got to learn from them. Conclusion. The journey was the most gratifying piece of it all. \\n\\n2021 is ending. How were you challenged over the past 365 days? How did you react? Did you meet the standards you set for yourself? Did you fall back on old habits? Did you build new ones? What did you learn? Take some time to reflect. Write it down and save it as your annual review.\\n\\nSo what's next?\\n\\nWe're going to start off 2022 on the good foot. I'll be using this newsletter for my own accountability. Reply to this newsletter with your goals and we can be accountability partners.

If you're not good at something, work on it until it no longer prevents your progress, but the bulk of your time is better spent maximizing your strengths. \\n  \\n Source: [James Clear 3-2-1](https://jamesclear.com/3-2-1) \\n  \\n  \\n “The worst happened, and then it passed. You lost the person you thought you couldn’t live without and then you kept living. You lost your job then found another one. You began to realize that “safety” isn’t in certainty—but in faith that you can simply keep going.” \\n  \\n Source: [Brianna Wiest, 101 Essays That Will Change the Way You Think](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32998876-101-essays-that-will-change-the-way-you-think)\\n\\n![I AM AN IRONMAN](https://mcusercontent.com/56f82e2c0d8ed90a99f973f79/images/6c6e5c56-5be2-13af-1356-5360a9647081.jpeg)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641491655,\"title\":\"Brewer's IRONMAN: End of the Year Edition\"},\"digest\":\"4b_57upnc-7j3_ENNDAQAPEbQcLlw61zEEoX9Kr0nMY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0F77725948939345ec33B21DeD591Bb1d7593163\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pCC1KAs-FAVSnHtVq6bxudNhdzEGKXFuUKEI4ZVGqNA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"p7RXq-yGqwAdO1u7cZg6PVwvHEPkhFdWwErJzxee5p4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FS6iD1ndS07tbpcttXM0ypLg8fa5zChHP3He3MVyeG1SPtOcAPfDE3DyBX3QllFkjqPNmtYiMPCem7oV0FDC3w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa9de3c8dd4224071dac98156701714ea32202dffc28763be90f322a1d2d9e2b74f4c8a75f8eb124f68bb9b63a4ff01b6d40a8eaa799bb7af5f36aaad96750be41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"pCC1KAs-FAVSnHtVq6bxudNhdzEGKXFuUKEI4ZVGqNA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"p7RXq-yGqwAdO1u7cZg6PVwvHEPkhFdWwErJzxee5p4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4b_57upnc-7j3_ENNDAQAPEbQcLlw61zEEoX9Kr0nMY\"}"
