We're a married couple that likes to do out-of-the-box shit to create our music. We’ve been writing, producing, creating, and touring for the last 4 years as FINKEL, and the last decade as a part of other projects.\\n\\n![Photo by Meredith Adelaide from FINKEL FINDS Episode 1](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/BBjqtbt7tBu7B3rG4kfoi.jpg?height=1500&width=1000)\\n\\nIn every project we’ve been a part of, we’ve pushed the creative envelope by curating unique writing workshops that help shape the music we make. The workshops we run are grounded by a set of parameters that get the juices flowing. For example, simply being in a new-and-inspiring location breeds creativity. Another example came about in 2018 when we [wore various colored lenses for months-on-end to change our perspective, and therefore our creative output](https://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/why-pop-duo-finkel-look-at-life-through-rose-colored-glasses-literally/Content?oid=22331130). A common way we push our creative envelope is by collaborating with artists of various mediums.\\n\\nIn 2018 when launching FINKEL, we had the vision of taking these experiences to a public documentary-style format. After 3 years of planning and practicing our craft, we  had the opportunity to shoot our first feature-length documentary on Mackinac Island, MI.  We were lucky enough to get an incredible team of directors, film-makers, producers, musicians, and animators excited about taking on the project as well. The album *Islanders* will be released on April 29th, and the documentary (also titled *Islanders*) will be coming out in Q3 or Q4 of 2022.\\n\\nAfter wrapping the album and the feature-length doc, we decided to try our hand at creating a similar project in a shorter format. We landed on *FINKEL FINDS* and began searching for the next interesting story, creator, location, art medium, etc. with the purpose of creating music from what we learn. In November 2021 we released our first episode, which features the talented multi-disciplinary artist, [Meredith Adelaide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAxV4vTHEfs).\\n\\nOur second episode of *FINKEL FINDS* features the power-couple, Latashá and Jah. Click the video link above to watch us write music, and ask them how they find balance in their creative partnership and relationship. \\n\\n## ROADMAP 2022\\n\\nWe have plans to pilot one more episode of *FINKEL FINDS* with [First Star](https://www.firststar.org/), a college readiness program for foster children (super stoked). After working out some kinks in the first 3 *FINKEL FINDS* episodes, we want to open things up to our community.\\n\\n**GOAL:** We want *FINKEL FINDS* to be a community-produced docuseries. We’re aiming to make a total of 7 episodes for season 1, meaning the last 4 episodes of this season will be community produced. If this experiment works, we want to take this information and model to television networks and talk about creating *FINKEL FINDS* season 2 and beyond.\\n\\n**TIMELINE**\\n\\n*February 5, 2022:* Film Episode 3 of *FINKEL FINDS*, featuring First Star\\n\\n*February 21, 2022:* Begin community fundraise for the last 4 episode of *FINKEL FINDS* season 1\\n\\n*March 18, 2022:* End community fundraise for the last 4 episode of *FINKEL FINDS* season 1\\n\\n*May 2022:* Release Episode 3 of *FINKEL FINDS,* featuring First Star\\n\\n*May - October 2022:* Film and release the last 4 episodes of *FINKEL FINDS* season 1, with the help of the community\\n\\n*November 2022:* Begin planning for the next season of *FINKEL FINDS* or the next feature length documentary.\\n\\n## CLOSING\\n\\nIf you’ve made it this far, thanks! We have big plans, and want them to lift up our FINKEL FAM community, shed light on artists locations and experiences, and bring financial independence. This is an EVERYBODY EATS kind-of-year. We hope you are hungry, because there’s a seat waiting for everyone at the FINKEL dinner table and we’re about to serve din. \\n\\n![Photo by Erin Soorenko](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MzGdba9TewyVwm4_kIr8G.jpg?height=6000&width=4000)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1642521699,\"title\":\"FINKEL FINDS - Episode 2 with Latashá & Jah / 2022 Roadmap\"},\"digest\":\"IbnOaJ4kqUXgLP756D45M8vRnISJgipIPnVziaTHsvM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD08924607d051ab304A319BCfBa040c8F3E75B11\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"smASB6JdPZPY67Vl7UO54Ygs7PlV3o5HyzgCKsn-H-8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l_a53vFZ5ole3NtnIy50l3p1FUo7Jtcq5egdkfaMN-A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"YgFmZXf4XXipZZfiZJfPHz_39WK7ujbzZGp3DuSStTXnpTaxiuHat7LTag2q8spF254UrlPbU3Py7ffkWbbZzg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x71cab5009cf33618b4723475bb99e4c97ee031fa370a5e1d1552c979b20b65c50e438d9dbe2887301792efd4724de528ffc30e0526f26f436d39d1989ec07f4c1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"smASB6JdPZPY67Vl7UO54Ygs7PlV3o5HyzgCKsn-H-8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"l_a53vFZ5ole3NtnIy50l3p1FUo7Jtcq5egdkfaMN-A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"LmmqH36YBWgo8KsiwSWAYtwT01Rkb_SYlaoBd3_XkJw\"}"
