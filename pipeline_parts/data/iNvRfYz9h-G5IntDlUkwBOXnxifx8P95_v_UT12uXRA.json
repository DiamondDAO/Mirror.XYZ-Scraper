"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Recently I have found myself listening and re-listening to a slew of podcasts, usually on the topics of either entrepreneurship, personal growth, or simply just a different prospective towards looking at something. This has resulted in me listening to all sorts of perspectives, although I have found most of them to include personalities such as Lex Fridman, Joe Rogan, Chamath Palihapitiya, Elon Musk, and Nat Eliason, just to name a few.\\n\\nOne particular podcast episode that impacted me immensely was Part 4 of Lex Fridman's Ask Me Anything series, where Lex talks about imposter syndrome and pursuing things that he wants to do at the most fundamental level.\\n\\nWhat particularly resonated with me here was not necessarily his talk about imposter syndrome or paving your own path (although I did draw inspiration from those areas as well), but rather his introduction of a new perspective that seems to be a better alternative to the comparative nature in which humans constantly judge themselves on.\\n\\nLex describes this perspective as a \\\"positive side to envy\\\", a sort of anti-schadenfreude in a way, where a person derives **pleasure**, not envy, from another person's **success**. It is not a form of comparison such that the result is jealousy, but rather a form of **inspiration** such that the result is a newfound goal or more confidence that the \\\"compared task\\\" could be possibly accomplished.\\n\\nThink of yourself as a marathon runner who is competing against Eliud Kipchoge, the fastest man in marathon history. Eliud recently became the first person ever to run a marathon in under two hours. As a competitive runner, there is a certain innate feeling of dissatisfaction that gets triggered every time you are defeated in a race by a \\\"superior\\\" opponent. This dissatisfaction could possibly stem from the simple fact that you were not as fast as Eliud, and that you will never be as good. However, Lex's argument is that Eliud Kipchoge **should not even be considered** as your opponent. **The task of breaking the two hour marathon should be the opponent**, and seeing Eliud become the first person in the world to break the two hour marathon mark should bring yourself confidence, rather than envy. This is because Eliud has proved that the opponent **could now be beaten**, when it previously seemed impossible to accomplish. Once a task that you want to accomplish turns from impossible to possible, we finally have a roadmap to overcome it, where before there was no path at all. Knowing that the task can now possibly be reached should give you all the confidence in the world.\\n\\nUpon seeing this \\\"positive side\\\" to envy, I felt like I had been able to unlock a whole new world of thought. I feel like this sort of thinking brings so much growth and opportunity toward viewing the world in a different way. It also seems to shine a light on how insignificant the traditional battles of comparison are. This sort of mindset reframes your goals from beating others to accomplishing hard tasks. By reframing my goals, I have found this method to be a positive step toward removing the negative ramifications of imposter syndrome and/or the comparison mindset.\\n\\nBecause 30 years from now, what would you remember more: the person that you managed to eclipse, or the monumental task that you were able to accomplish instead?\",\"timestamp\":1635784597,\"title\":\"A Positive Alternative to Envy\"},\"digest\":\"flqKDT3lnH6plFc8YKIq2BFDbg3Py0Ic-Ds_iKyIZ08\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6cf7c6597D7d293c7C47C6BF2e87A6D34052bEe3\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wdu5nh4sJM2pHdAvZ8keoXbGA3fWbrHPq7dkw9acS6s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZRmHWSqFD5-HZ_kRdfl4bbsxcPUePi5AwqeojUxinGo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"U5mgBHGZgvUzfAhpTBPxDCD4oTshkxxmE6reiybZWzYeptU34T6kLDgzq81NSudX8caSJjziHj3LMAMKVTqjNg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8539bb96dc2ea5ed348782a88eef39a5f79dd760d1c54b325719eaa1fcf3954538ef4e2fe795a5864c9bdc252eb3461b278b8187a9b98d4aafd2fe4f8fafc9e71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wdu5nh4sJM2pHdAvZ8keoXbGA3fWbrHPq7dkw9acS6s\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZRmHWSqFD5-HZ_kRdfl4bbsxcPUePi5AwqeojUxinGo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"flqKDT3lnH6plFc8YKIq2BFDbg3Py0Ic-Ds_iKyIZ08\"}"
