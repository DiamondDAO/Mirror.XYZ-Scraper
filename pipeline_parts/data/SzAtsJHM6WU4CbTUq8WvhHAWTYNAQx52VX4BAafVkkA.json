"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Borellus, Bidault, and others, are ordinarily results of a pathologic development of the sebaceous glands. In some cases tumors develop from the root of the nose, forming what appears to be a second nose. In other cases monstrous vegetations divide the nose into many tumors. In the early portion of this century much was heard about a man who was a daily habitue of the Palais-Royal Gardens. His nose was divided into unequally sized tumors, covering nearly his entire face. Similar instances have been observed in recent years. Hey mentions a case in which the tumor extended to the lower part of the under lip, which compressed the patient's mouth and nostrils to such an extent that while sleeping, in order to insure sufficient respiration, he had to insert a tin-tube into one of his nostrils. Imbert de Lannes is quoted as operating on a former Mayor of Angouleme. This gentleman's nose was divided into five lobes by sarcomatous tumors weighing two pounds, occupying the external surface of the face, adherent to the buccinator muscles to which they extended, and covering the chin. In the upright position the tumors sealed the nostrils and mouth, and the man had to bend his head before and after respiration. In eating, this unfortunate: person had to lift his tumors away from his mouth, and during sleep the monstrous growths were supported in a sling attached to his night cap. He presented such a hideous aspect that he was virtually ostracized from society The growth had been in progress for twelve years, but during twenty-two months' confinement in Revolutionary prisons the enlargement had been very rapid. Fournier says that the most beautiful result followed the operation which was considered quite hazardous.\\n\\nForeign bodies in the nose present phenomena as interesting as wounds of this organ. Among the living objects which have been found in the nose may be mentioned flies, maggots, worms, leeches, centipedes, and even lizards. Zacutus Lusitanus tells of a person who died in two days from the effects of a leech which was inadvertently introduced into the nasal fossa, and there is a somewhat similar case of a military pharmacist, a member of the French army in Spain, who drank some water from a pitcher and exhibited, about a half hour afterward, a persistent hemorrhage from the nose. Emaciation progressively continued, although his appetite was normal. Three doctors, called in consultation, prescribed bleeding, which, however, proved of no avail. Three weeks afterward he carried in his nostril a tampon of lint, wet with an astringent solution, and, on the next day, on blowing his nose, there fell from the right nostril a body which he recognized as a leech. Healey gives the history of four cases in which medicinal leeches were removed from the mouth and posterior nares of persons who had, for some days previously, been drinking turbid water. Sinclair mentions the removal of a leech from the posterior nares.\\n\\nIn some regions, more particularly tropical ones, there are certain flies that crawl into the nostrils of the inhabitants and deposit eggs, in the cavities. The larvae develop and multiply with great rapidity, and sometimes gain admission into the frontal sinus, causing intense cephalalgia, and even death.\\n\\nDempster reports an instance of the lodgment of numerous live maggots within the cavity of the nose, causing sloughing of the palate and other complications. Nicholson mentions a case of ulceration and abscess of the nostrils and face from which maggots were discharged. Jarvis gives the history of a strange and repeated hemorrhage from the nose and adjacent parts that was found to be due to maggots from the ova of a fly, which had been deposited in the nose while the patient was asleep. Tomlinson gives a case in which maggots traversed the Eustachian tube, some being picked out of the nostrils, while others were coughed up. Packard records the accidental entrance of a centipede into the nostril. There is an account of a native who was admitted to the Madras General Hospital, saying that a small lizard had crawled up his nose. The urine of these animals is very irritating, blistering any surface it touches. Despite vigorous treatment the patient died in consequence of the entrance of this little creature.\\n\\nThere have been instances among the older writers in which a pea has remained in the nose for such a length of time as to present evidences of sprouting. The Ephemerides renders an instance of this kind, and Breschet cites the history of a young boy, who, in 1718, introduced a pea into his nostril; in three days it had swollen to such an extent as to fill the whole passage. It could not be extracted by an instrument, so tobacco snuff was used, which excited sneezing, and the pea was ejected.\\n\\nVidal and the Ephemerides report several instances of tolerance of foreign bodies in the nasal cavities for from twenty to twenty-five years. Wiesman, in 1893, reported a rhinolith, which was composed of a cherry-stone enveloped in chalk, that had been removed after a sojourn of sixty years, with intense ozena as a consequence of its lodgment. Waring mentions the case of a housemaid who carried a rhinolith, with a cherry-stone for a nucleus, which had been introduced twenty-seven years before, and which for twenty-five years had caused no symptoms. Grove describes a necrosed inferior turbinated bone, to which was attached a coffee-grain which had been retained in the nostril for twenty years., Hickman gives an instance of a steel ring which for thirteen and a half years had been impacted in the nasopharyngeal fossa of a child. It was detected by the rhinoscope and was removed. Parker speaks of a gunbreech bolt which was removed from the nose after five years' lodgment. Major mentions the removal of a foreign body from the nose seven years after its introduction.\\n\\nHoward removed a large thimble from the posterior nares, although it had remained in its position for some time undetected. Eve reports a case in which a thimble was impacted in the right posterior nares. Gazdar speaks, of a case of persistent neuralgia of one-half of the face, caused by a foreign body in the nose. The obstruction was removed after seven years' lodgment and the neuralgia disappeared. Molinier has an observation on the extraction of a fragment of a knife-blade which had rested four years in the nasal fossae, where the blade had broken off during a quarrel.\\n\\nA peculiar habit, sometimes seen in nervous individuals, is that of \\\"swallowing the tongue.\\\" Cohen claims that in some cases of supposed laryngeal spasm the tongue is swallowed, occluding the larynx, and sometimes with fatal consequences. There are possibly a half score of cases recorded, but this anomaly is very rare, and Major is possibly the only one who has to a certainty demonstrated the fact by a laryngoscopic examination. By the laryngoscope he was enabled to observe a paroxysm in a woman, in which the tongue retracted and impinged on the epiglottis, but quickly recovered its position. Pettit mentions suffocation from \\\"tongue swallowing,\\\" both with and without section of the frenum. Schobinger cites a similar instance, due to loosening of the frenum.\\n\\nAnalogous to the foregoing phenomenon is the habit of \\\"tongue sucking.\\\" Morris mentions a young lady of fifteen who spontaneously dislocated her jaw, owing indirectly to this habit. Morris says that from infancy the patient was addicted to this habit, which was so audible as to be heard in all parts of the room. The continued action of the pterygoid muscles had so preternaturally loosened the ligaments and muscular structures supporting the joint as to render them unable to resist the violent action of \\\"tongue sucking\\\" even during sleep.\\n\\nInjuries to the Tongue.--Hobbs describes a man of twenty-three who, while working, had a habit of protruding his tongue. One day he was hit under the chin by the chain of a crane on a pier, his upper teeth inflicting a wound two inches deep, three inches from the tip, and dividing the entire structure of the tongue except the arteries. The edges of the wound were brought into apposition by sutures, and after the removal of the latter perfect union and complete restoration of the sensation of taste ensued. Franck mentions regeneration of a severed tongue; and Van Wy has seen union of almost entirely severed parts of the tongue. De Fuisseaux reports reunion of the tongue by suture after almost complete transverse division.\\n\\nThere is an account of a German soldier who, May 2, 1813, was wounded at the battle of Gross-Gorschen by a musket ball which penetrated the left cheek, carrying away the last four molars of the upper jaw and passing through the tongue, making exit on the left side, and forcing out several teeth of the left lower jaw. To his surprise, thirty years afterward, one of the teeth was removed from an abscess of the tongue. Baker speaks of a boy of thirteen who was shot at three yards distance. The bullet knocked out two teeth and passed through the tongue, although it produced no wound of the pharynx, and was passed from the anus on the sixth day. Stevenson mentions a case of an organist who fell forward when stooping with a pipe in his mouth, driving its stem into the roof of the pharynx. He complained of a sore throat for several days, and, after explanation, Stevenson removed from the soft palate a piece of clay pipe nearly 1 1/4 inches long. Herbert tells of a case resembling carcinoma of the tongue, which was really due to the lodgment of a piece of tooth in that organ.\\n\\nArticulation Without the Tongue.--Total or partial destruction of the tongue does not necessarily make articulation impossible. Banon mentions a man who had nothing in his mouth representing a tongue. When he was young, he was attacked by an ulceration destroying every vestige of this member. The epiglottis, larynx, and pharynx, in fact the surrounding structures were normal, and articulation, which was at first lost, became fairly distinct, and deglutition was never interfered with. Pare gives a description of a man whose tongue was completely severed, in consequence of which he lost speech for three years, but was afterward able to make himself understood by an ingenious bit of mechanism. He inserted under the stump of the tongue a small piece of wood, in a most marvelous way replacing the missing member. Articulation with the absence of some constituent of the vocal apparatus has been spoken of on page 254.\\n\\nHypertrophy of the Tongue.--It sometimes happens that the tongue is so large that it is rendered not only useless but a decided hindrance to the performance of the ordinary functions into which it always enters. Ehrlich, Ficker, Klein, Rodforffer, and the Ephemerides, all record instances in which a large tongue was removed either by ligation or amputation. Von Siebold records an instance in which death was caused by the ligature of an abnormally sized tongue. There is a modern record of three cases of enormous tongues, the result of simple hypertrophy. In one case the tongue measured 6 1/4 inches from the angle of the mouth about the sides and tip to the opposite angle, necessitating amputation of the protruding portion.\\n\\nCarnochan reports a case in which hypertrophy of the tongue was reduced to nearly the normal size by first tying the external carotid, and six weeks later the common carotid artery. Chalk mentions partial dislocation of the lower jaw from an enlarged tongue. Lyford speaks of enlargement of the tongue causing death.\\n\\nThe above conditions are known as macroglossia, which is a congenital hypertrophy of the tongue analogous to elephantiasis. It is of slow growth, and as the organ enlarges it interferes with deglutition and speech. It may protrude over the chin and reach even as far down as the sternum.\\n\\nThe great enlargement may cause deformities of the teeth and lower jaw, and even present itself as an enormous tumor in the neck. The protruding tongue itself may ulcerate, possibly bleed, and there is constant dribbling of saliva. The disease is probably due to congenital defect aggravated by frequent attacks of glossitis, and the treatment consists in the removal of the protruding portions by the knife, ligation, the cautery, or ecraseur.\\n\\nLiving Fish in the Pharynx.--Probably the most interesting cases of foreign bodies are those in which living fish enter the pharynx and esophagus. Chevers has collected five cases in which death was caused by living fish entering the mouth and occluding the air-passages. He has mentioned a case in which a large catfish jumped into the mouth of a Madras bheestie. An operation on the esophagus was immediately commenced, but abandoned, and an attempt made to push the fish down with a probang, which was, in a measure, successful. However, the patient gave a convulsive struggle, and, to all appearances, died. The trachea was immediately opened, and respiration was restored. During the course of the night the man vomited up pieces of fish bone softened by decomposition. In 1863 White mentions that the foregoing accident is not uncommon among the natives of India, who are in the habit of swimming with their mouths open in tanks abounding with fish. There is a case in which a fisherman, having both hands engaged in drawing a net, and seeing a sole-fish about eight inches long trying to escape through the meshes of the net, seized it with his teeth. A sudden convulsive effort of the fish enabled it to enter the fisherman's throat, and he was asphyxiated before his boat reached the shore. After death the fish was found in the cardiac end of the stomach. There is another case of a man named Durand, who held a mullet between his teeth while rebaiting his hook. The fish, in the convulsive struggles of death, slipped down the throat, and because of the arrangement of its scales it could be pushed down but not up; asphyxiation, however, ensued. Stewart has extensively described the case of a native \\\"Puckally\\\" of Ceylon who was the victim of the most distressing symptoms from the impaction of a living fish in his throat. The native had caught the fish, and in order to extract it placed its head between his teeth, holding the body with the left hand and the hook with the right. He had hardly extracted the hook, when the fish pricked his palm with his long and sharp dorsal fin, causing him suddenly to release his grasp on the fish and voluntarily open his mouth at the same time. The fish quickly bolted into his mouth, and, although he grasped the tail with his right hand, and squeezed his pharynx with his left, besides coughing violently, the fish found its way into the esophagus. Further attempts at extraction were dangerous and quite likely to fail; his symptoms were distressing, he could not hold his head erect without the most agonizing pain and he was almost prostrated from fright and asphyxia; it was thought advisable to push the fish into the stomach, and after an impaction of sixteen hours the symptoms were relieved. The fish in this instance was the Anabas scandens or \\\"walking perch\\\" of Ceylon, which derives its name from its power of locomotion on land and its ability to live out of water for some time. It is from four to five inches long and has a dorsal fin as sharp as a knife and directed toward the tail, and pectoral fins following the same direction; these would admit of entrance, but would interfere with extraction. MacLauren reports the history of a young man who, after catching a fish, placed it between his teeth. The fish, three inches long, by a sudden movement, entered the pharynx. Immediately ensued suffocation, nausea, vomiting, together with the expectoration of blood and mucus. There was emphysema of the face, neck, and chest. The fish could be easily felt impacted in the tissues, but, after swallowing much water and vinegar, together with other efforts at extraction, the fins were loosened--about twenty-four hours after the accident. By this time the emphysema had extended to the scrotum. There was much expectoration of muco-purulent fluid, and on the third day complete aphonia, but the symptoms gradually disappeared, and recovery was complete in eight days. Dantra is accredited with describing asphyxiation, accompanied by great agony, in a man who, while swimming, had partially swallowed a live fish. The fish was about three inches in length and one in breadth, and was found lying on the dorsum of his tongue and, together with numerous clots of blood, filled his mouth. Futile attempts to extract the fish by forceps were made. Examination showed that the fish had firmly grasped the patient's uvula, which it was induced to relinquish when its head was seized by the forceps and pressed from side to side. After this it was easily extracted and lived for some time. There was little hemorrhage after the removal of the offending object, and the blood had evidently come from the injuries to the sides of the mouth, caused by the fins. The uvula was bitten, not torn. There is an interesting account of a native of India, who, while fishing in a stream, caught a flat eel-like fish from fifteen to sixteen inches long. After the fashion of his fellows he attempted to kill the eel by biting off its head; in the attempt the fish slipped into his gullet, and owing to its sharp fins could not be withdrawn. The man died one hour later in the greatest agony; so firmly was the eel impacted that even after death it could not be extracted, and the man was buried with it protruding from his mouth.\\n\\nA Leech in the Pharynx.--Granger, a surgeon in Her Majesty's Indian Service, writes:--\\\"Several days ago I received a note from the political sirdar, asking me if I would see a man who said he had a leech in his throat which he was unable to get rid of. I was somewhat sceptical, and thought that possibly the man might be laboring under a delusion. On going outside the fort to see the case, I found an old Pathan graybeard waiting for me. On seeing me, he at once spat out a large quantity of dark, half-clotted blood to assure me of the serious nature of his complaint. His history--mostly made out with the aid of interpreters--was that eleven days ago he was drinking from a rain-water tank and felt something stick in his throat, which he could not reject. He felt this thing moving, and it caused difficulty in swallowing, and occasionally vomiting. On the following day he began to spit up blood, and this continued until he saw me. He stated that he once vomited blood, and that he frequently felt that he was going to choke.\\n\\nOn examining his throat, a large clot of blood was found to be adherent to the posterior wall of the pharynx. On removing this clot of blood, no signs of the presence of a leech could be detected. However, on account of the symptoms complained of by the patient I introduced a polypus forceps into the lower part of the pharynx and toward the esophagus, where a body, distinctly moving, was felt. This body I seized with the forceps, and with considerable force managed to remove it. It was a leech between 2 1/2 and three inches in length, and with a body of the size of a Lee-Metford bullet. No doubt during the eleven days it had remained in the man's throat the leech had increased in size. Nevertheless it must have been an animal of considerable size when the man attempted to swallow it. I send this case as a typical example of the carelessness of natives of the class from which we enlist our Sepoys, as to the nature of the water they drink. This man had drunk the pea-soup like water of a tank dug in the side of the hill, rather than go a few hundred yards to a spring where the water is perfectly clear and pure. Though I have not met with another case of leeches being taken with drinking water, I am assured that such cases are occasionally met with about Agra and other towns in the North-West Provinces. This great carelessness as to the purity or impurity of their drinking water shows the difficulty medical officers must experience in their endeavors to prevent the Sepoys of a regiment from drinking water from condemned or doubtful sources during a cholera or typhoid epidemic.\\\"\\n\\nForeign Bodies in the Pharynx and Esophagus.--Aylesbury mentions a boy who swallowed a fish-hook while eating gooseberries. He tried to pull it up, but it was firmly fastened, and a surgeon was called. By ingeniously passing a leaden bullet along the line, the weight of the lead loosened the hook, and both bullet and hook were easily drawn up. Babbit and Battle report an ingenious method of removing a piece of meat occluding the esophagus--the application of trypsin. Henry speaks of a German officer who accidentally swallowed a piece of beer bottle, 3/8 x 1/8 inch, which subsequently penetrated the esophagus, and in its course irritated the recurrent laryngeal and vagi, giving rise to the most serious phlegmonous inflammation and distressing respiratory symptoms. A peculiar case is that of the man who died after a fire at the Eddystone Lighthouse. He was endeavoring to extinguish the flames which were at a considerable distance above his head, and was looking up with his mouth open, when the lead of a melting lantern dropped down in such quantities as not only to cover his face and enter his mouth, but run over his clothes. The esophagus and tunica in the lower part of the stomach were burned, and a great piece of lead, weighing over 7 1/2 ounces, was taken from the stomach after death.\\n\\nEvans relates the history of a girl of twenty-one who swallowed four artificial teeth, together with their gold plate; two years and eight days afterward she ejected them after a violent attack of retching. Gauthier speaks of a young girl who, while eating soup, swallowed a fragment of bone. For a long time she had symptoms simulating phthisis, but fourteen years afterward the bone was dislodged, and, although the young woman was considered in the last stages of phthisis, she completely recovered in six weeks. Gastellier has reported the case of a young man of sixteen who swallowed a crown piece, which became lodged in the middle portion of the esophagus and could not be removed. For ten months the piece of money remained in this position, during which the young man was never without acute pain and often had convulsions. He vomited material, sometimes alimentary, sometimes mucus, pus, or blood, and went into the last stage of marasmus. At last, after this long-continued suffering, following a strong convulsion and syncope, the coin descended to the stomach, and the young man expectorated great quantities of pus. After thirty-five years, the coin had not been passed by the rectum.\\n\\nInstances of migration of foreign bodies from the esophagus are repeatedly recorded. There is an instance of a needle which was swallowed and lodged in the esophagus, but twenty-one months afterward was extracted by an incision at a point behind the right ear. Kerckring speaks of a girl who swallowed a needle which was ultimately extracted from the muscles of her neck. Poulet remarks that Vigla has collected the most interesting of these cases of migration of foreign bodies. Hevin mentions several cases of grains of wheat abstracted from abscesses of the thoracic parietes, from thirteen to fifteen days after ingestion. Bonnet and Helmontius have reported similar facts. Volgnarius has seen a grain of wheat make its exit from the axilla, and Polisius mentions an abscess of the back from which was extracted a grain of wheat three months after ingestion. Bally reports a somewhat similar instance, in which, three months after ingestion, during an attack of peripneumonia, a foreign body was extracted from an abscess of the thorax, between the 2d and 3d ribs. Ambrose found a needle encysted in the heart of a negress. She distinctly stated that she had swallowed it at a time calculated to have been nine years before her death. Planque speaks of a small bone perforating the esophagus and extracted through the skin.\\n\\nAbscess or ulceration, consequent upon periesophagitis, caused by the lodgment of foreign bodies in the esophagus, often leads to the most serious results. There is an instance of a soldier who swallowed a bone while eating soup, who died on the thirty-first day from the rupture internally of an esophageal abscess. Grellois has reported the history of a case of a child twenty-two months old, who suffered for some time with impaction of a small bone in the esophagus. Less than three months afterward the patient died with all the symptoms of marasmus, due to difficult deglutition, and at the autopsy an abscess was seen in the posterior wall of the pharynx, opposite the 3d cervical vertebra; extensive caries was also noticed in the bodies of the 2d, 3d, and 4th cervical vertebrae. Guattani mentions a curious instance in which a man playing with a chestnut threw it in the air, catching it in his mouth. The chestnut became lodged in the throat and caused death on the nineteenth day. At the autopsy it was found that an abscess communicating with the trachea had been formed in the pharynx and esophagus.\\n\\nA peculiarly fatal accident in this connection is that in which a foreign body in the esophagus ulcerates, and penetrates one of the neighboring major vessels. Colles mentions a man of fifty-six who, while eating, perceived a sensation as of a rent in the chest. The pain was augmented during deglutition, and almost immediately afterward he commenced to expectorate great quantities of blood. On the following day he vomited a bone about an inch long and died on the same day. At the autopsy it was found that there was a rent in the posterior wall of the esophagus, about 1/2 inch long, and a corresponding wound of the aorta. There was blood in the pleura, pericardium, stomach, and intestines. There is one case in which a man of forty-seven suddenly died, after vomiting blood, and at the autopsy it was demonstrated that a needle had perforated the posterior wall of the esophagus and wounded the aorta. Poulet has collected 31 cases in which ulceration caused by foreign bodies in the esophagus has resulted in perforation of the walls of some of the neighboring vessels. The order of frequency was as follows: aorta, 17; carotids, four; vena cava, two; and one case each of perforation of the inferior thyroid artery, right coronary vein, demi-azygos vein, the right subclavicular artery (abnormal), and the esophageal artery. In three of the cases collected there was no autopsy and the vessel affected was not known.\\n\\nIn a child of three years that had swallowed a half-penny, Atkins reports rupture of the innominate artery. No symptoms developed, but six weeks later, the child had an attack of ulcerative stomatitis, from which it seemed to be recovering nicely, when suddenly it ejected two ounces of bright red blood in clots, and became collapsed out of proportion to the loss of blood. Under treatment, it rallied somewhat, but soon afterward it ejected four ounces more of blood and died in a few minutes. At the autopsy 3/4 pint of blood was found in the stomach, and a perforation was discovered on the right side of the esophagus, leading into a cavity, in which a blackened half-penny was found. A probe passed along the aorta into the innominate protruded into the same cavity about the bifurcation of the vessel.\\n\\nDenonvilliers has described a perforation of the esophagus and aorta by a five-franc piece. A preserved preparation of this case, showing the coin in situ, is in the Musee Dupuytren. Blaxland relates the instance of a woman of forty-five who swallowed a fish bone, was seized with violent hematemesis, and died in eight hours. The necropsy revealed a penetration of the aorta through the thoracic portion of the esophagus. There is also in the Musee Dupuytren a preparation described by Bousquet, in which the aorta and the esophagus were perforated by a very irregular piece of bone. Mackenzie mentions an instance of death from perforation of the aorta by a fish-bone.\\n\\nIn some cases penetration of the esophagus allows the further penetration of some neighboring membrane or organ in the same manner as the foregoing cases. Dudley mentions a case in which fatal hemorrhage was caused by penetration of the esophagus and lung by a chicken-bone. Buist speaks of a patient who swallowed two artificial teeth. On the following day there was pain in the epigastrium, and by the fourth day the pain extended to the vertebrae, with vomiting, delirium, and death on the fifth day. At the autopsy it was found that a foreign body, seven cm. long had perforated the pericardium, causing a suppurative pericarditis. Dagron reports a unique instance of death by purulent infection arising from perforation of the esophagus by a pin. The patient was a man of forty-two, and, some six weeks before he presented himself for treatment, before swallowing had experienced a severe pain low down in the neck. Five days before admission he had had a severe chill, followed by sweating and delirium. He died of a supraclavicular abscess on the fifth day; a black steel pin was found against the esophagus and trachea.\\n\\nIn connection with foreign bodies in the esophagus, it might be interesting to remark that Ashhurst has collected 129 cases of esophagotomy for the removal of foreign bodies, resulting in 95 recoveries and 34 deaths. Gaudolphe collected 142 cases with 110 recoveries.\\n\\nInjuries of the neck are usually inflicted with suicidal intent or in battle. Cornelius Nepos says that while fighting against the Lacedemonians, Epaminondas was sensible of having received a mortal wound, and apprehending that the lance was stopping a wound in an important vessel, remarked that he would die when it was withdrawn. When he was told that the Boeotians had conquered, exclaiming \\\"I die unconquered,\\\" he drew out the lance and perished. Petrus de Largenta speaks of a man with an arrow in one of his carotids, who was but slightly affected before its extraction, but who died immediately after the removal of the arrow. Among the remarkable recoveries from injuries of the neck is that mentioned by Boerhaave, of a young man who lived nine or ten days after receiving a sword-thrust through the neck between the 4th and 5th vertebrae, dividing the vertebral artery. Benedictus, Bonacursius, and Monroe, all mention recovery after cases of cut-throat in which the esophagus as well as the trachea was wounded, and food protruded from the external cut. Warren relates the history of a case in which the vertebral artery was wounded by the discharge of a pistol loaded with pebbles. The hemorrhage was checked by compression and packing, and after the discharge of a pebble and a piece of bone from the wound, the man was seen a month afterward in perfect health. Corson of Norristown, Pa., has reported the case of a quarryman who was stabbed in the neck with a shoemaker's knife, severing the left carotid one inch below its division. He was seen thirty minutes later in an apparently lifeless condition, but efforts at resuscitation were successfully made. The hemorrhage ceased spontaneously, and at the time of report, the man presented the symptoms of one who had had his carotid ligated (facial atrophy on one side, no pulse, etc.). Baron Larrey mentions a case of gunshot wound in which the carotid artery was open at its division into internal and external branches, and says that the wound was plugged by an artilleryman until ligation, and in this primitive manner the patient was saved. Sale reports the case of a girl of nineteen, who fell on a china bowl that she had shattered, and wounded both the right common carotid artery and internal jugular vein. There was profuse and continuous hemorrhage for a time, and subsequently a false aneurysm developed, which ruptured in about three months, giving rise to enormous momentary hemorrhage; notwithstanding the severity of the injury and the extent of the hemorrhage, complete recovery ensued. Amos relates the instance of a woman named Mary Green who, after complete division of all the vessels of the neck, walked 23 yards and climbed over an ordinary bar-gate nearly four feet high.\\n\\nCholmeley reports the instance of a Captain of the First Madras Fusileers, who was wounded at Pegu by a musket-ball penetrating his neck. The common carotid was divided and for five minutes there was profuse hemorrhage which, however, strange to say, spontaneously ceased. The patient died in thirty-eight hours, supposedly from spinal concussion or shock.\\n\\nRelative to ligature of the common carotid artery, Ashhurst mentions the fact that the artery has been ligated in 228 instances, with 94 recoveries. Ellis mentions ligature of both carotids in four and a half days, as a treatment for a gunshot wound, with subsequent recovery. Lewtas reports a case of ligation of the innominate and carotid arteries for traumatic aneurysm (likely a hematoma due to a gunshot injury of the subclavian artery). The patient was in profound collapse, but steadily reacted and was discharged cured on the forty-fifth day, with no perceptible pulse at the wrist and only a feeble beat in the pulmonary artery.\",\"timestamp\":1639718853,\"title\":\"\\nDeformities of the nose causing enormous development, or the condition called \\\"double-nose\"},\"digest\":\"lBQnMea0sOUVfEyuA5Odc-fIEqZJk0NG77-sFK_36V8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBD49781Dd387395918Bf70f33643d6b0BDC2f41E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UN2NKZTNnCM8hHKwukDjSpFT1glHz6caB7VTey5bRsQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NWOj8wk6Z2cBpNs9BFbDbU1qJeqfcniUcWe5goyuOr8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"GeISL7y4vw-9Ii4vH7Xs4ua34aucEX2vnbEXo__ZB0DFw3O2BWlYlwBfch8ssNe041bNsOxkulilZnDnExlq1A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x727c95ff05ada08888b8b8ac73738b2b6efde35cd247650c06be0947b0ac79801b21426fc2b084f667b31d79c7a31eac9ba31a6fb1d43dbd1b4fb6099d26486b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UN2NKZTNnCM8hHKwukDjSpFT1glHz6caB7VTey5bRsQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NWOj8wk6Z2cBpNs9BFbDbU1qJeqfcniUcWe5goyuOr8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"lBQnMea0sOUVfEyuA5Odc-fIEqZJk0NG77-sFK_36V8\"}"
