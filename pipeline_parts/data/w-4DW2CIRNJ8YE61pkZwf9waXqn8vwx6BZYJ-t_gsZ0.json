"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"WASHINGTON — Democratic congressional leaders have, for the time being, ruled out pursuing impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump. That could all change depending on what is in the eagerly awaited report on the Russia investigation being prepared by special counsel Robert Mueller.\\n\\nOn his way to Ohio Wednesday, Trump told reporters outside the White House that the public should have access to the Mueller report.\\n\\n“Let it come out. Let the people see,” Trump said. “Let’s see whether or not it is legit.”\\n\\nThe decision by Democratic congressional leaders to pass on impeachment seems to be mindful of recent history, especially the Republican-led impeachment effort against President Bill Clinton in 1998.\\n\\nIn announcing her opposition to impeachment, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said simply that Trump “wasn’t worth it.”\\n\\nPelosi is sticking to her position despite pressure from liberal activists.\\n\\n“Impeachment is a divisive issue in our country, and let us see what the facts are, what the law is, and what the behavior is of the president,” Pelosi recently told reporters at the Capitol.​\\n\\n**Trump: ‘Great job’**\\n\\nFor President Trump, the idea of impeachment is, not surprisingly, a non-starter.\\n\\n“Well, you can’t impeach somebody that is doing a great job. That is the way I view it,” Trump said when asked about the issue in January.\\n\\nLate last year, Trump told Reuters that he was not concerned about impeachment.\\n\\n“I think that the people would revolt if that happened,” he said.\\n\\nTrump’s Republican allies in Congress are also poised to leap to his defense.\\n\\n“I don’t think it is good for the country,” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters last week. “The Democrats made a decision (to want to impeach) on the day President Trump one.”\\n\\nSome Democrats want to keep pushing, including former Hillary Clinton senior adviser Philippe Reines. Reines wrote recently in the New York Times that Democrats would be doing a “civic duty” to pursue impeachment.\\n\\n“There is a mounting political cost to not impeaching Mr. Trump,” Reines wrote last week. “He will hail it as exoneration and he will go into the 2020 campaign under the banner, ‘I Told You So.’”​\\n\\n**Polls say no**\\n\\nRecent polls show most voters do not favor impeachment at this time. A Quinnipiac University poll earlier this month found that 59 percent of those surveyed do not think House Democrats should initiate impeachment proceedings against the president, while 35 percent support the idea.\\n\\nGiven that the 2020 election cycle is underway, Democrats may prefer to have the voters try to oust Trump during next year’s election, according to George Washington University analyst Matt Dallek.\\n\\n“By the time impeachment proceedings were even to ramp up, you are talking about the end of 2019 or early 2020,” Dallek told VOA this week. “That creates its own complication because there is another remedy for removing a president and it is called the election.”\\n\\n**Political risk**\\n\\nDemocrats clearly recall what happened to Bill Clinton in 1998. Clinton lied about and tried to cover up his affair with intern Monica Lewinsky, which led to his impeachment by the House. Clinton remained in office after he was acquitted in a trial in the Senate.\\n\\nHistorically, impeachment has been a rare event. Clinton was only the second president impeached by the House. Andrew Johnson was the first back in 1868. Johnson avoided removal by a single vote in the Senate.\\n\\nPresidential impeachments have been rare and that is by design, according to University of Virginia expert Larry Sabato.\\n\\n“They (the founders) did not want presidents impeached and convicted and thrown out of office for minor offenses. They expected Congress to do it only in extreme circumstances.”\\n\\nRepublicans paid a price for the Clinton impeachment, losing five House seats in the 1998 midterm elections. And Sabato said that lesson could have resonance for Democrats today as they mull impeaching Trump.\\n\\n“Given the fact that the Republicans took a wounded Bill Clinton and made him almost invulnerable for the rest of his term, it should serve as a warning to Democrats,” he said.\\n\\nExperts also note that the damage to Republicans from the Clinton impeachment was not long-lasting. George W. Bush narrowly beat Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election, and the political fallout from Clinton’s scandal may have cost Gore the presidency.\\n\\n**Senate obstacle**\\n\\nThe biggest obstacle facing any impeachment effort of Trump is the Republican-controlled Senate. Democrats would have to bring over at least 20 Republican senators in any impeachment trial in order to get a conviction and remove the president from office.\\n\\nA vote to impeach a president only requires a majority vote in the House, now controlled by Democrats. But in a Senate trial, it would take 67 of 100 senators to vote for conviction in order to remove the president from office, and Democrats concede that is not a possibility at the moment.\\n\\n“It has less than zero chance of passing the Senate,” Sabato said. “Why would you go through all this in the House of Representatives, torpedo your entire agenda to impeach Trump in order to send it to the Senate to have him exonerated and not convicted?”\\n\\n**​Nixon case**\\n\\nPresident Richard Nixon was not impeached over the Watergate scandal in 1974, but the process was well underway. The House began impeachment proceedings through the House Judiciary Committee and was preparing to move Articles of Impeachment to the House floor when Nixon decided to resign.\\n\\nSeveral Republican senators including Barry Goldwater went to the White House and made it clear to Nixon that he had lost Republican support and would not survive an impeachment trial in the Senate.\\n\\nSome analysts predict that President Trump could face renewed calls for his ouster depending on the findings of special counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Russian meddling in the 2016 election.\\n\\n“I think if the Mueller report indicates some serious wrongdoing by the president and his campaign, it really empowers Democrats to begin deliberating how to move forward with impeachment proceedings,” said Brookings Institution scholar John Hudak.\\n\\nBut other experts caution that it would have to be something quite serious for Republicans to even consider abandoning the president.\\n\\nGiven the lack of bipartisan support for impeachment at the moment, it does seem more likely that Trump will face the voters again in 2020 before he has to contend with a Democratic-led impeachment inquiry in the House.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1642436221,\"title\":\"Mindful of History, Democrats Hold Off on Attempt to Impeach Trump\"},\"digest\":\"OCnJv3WK2b4-92e9tXYztaSECm5tA2d0hHROi0huWzQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3564C8a4af3a907cbfD66473e39631a16B5b40f4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eecl1ly2PRwzc65mHqeUaJ-Bdpf8-DuDinebn59Mw1I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wLWhtb01CN9dHQ20BYr1qJfzn-gH1w3WXXvZe-oiQoM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-iM1GVAjhyTpv3I8vMt5VrGNjsXfvIvFa9Tkb7Xs1EN3Fu11hUzSSMGLbA15OMeV-H_mibymZsKsXoIzDtLwMA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5e6fda95f8cf39088c46bfa9bdab81ca16735040fe81e51c5c3a8e8d3f4ef99200237afd2ed6a2e87add43062925bb7447bf2c1d610653065a45af5785cad29f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"eecl1ly2PRwzc65mHqeUaJ-Bdpf8-DuDinebn59Mw1I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wLWhtb01CN9dHQ20BYr1qJfzn-gH1w3WXXvZe-oiQoM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OCnJv3WK2b4-92e9tXYztaSECm5tA2d0hHROi0huWzQ\"}"
