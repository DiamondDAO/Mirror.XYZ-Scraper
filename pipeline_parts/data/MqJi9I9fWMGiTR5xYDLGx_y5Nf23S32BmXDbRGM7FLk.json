"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Hello, I am Rext Racer. Your correspondent for the first annual Formula EVM World Championships. I invite you to join me in this fast-paced gamified DAO experience where members select their L1 team and compete to win their share of the grand-prix pool… and the title of 2022 World Champion!**\\n\\nWhile the teams are warming up their cars, and drivers are getting their heads in the game, I will be bringing you up-to-speed on the vision, rules, and roadmap for this year's competition.\\n\\nIn this post, I will lay the groundwork for the FEVM competition including competition basics, introducing the teams, and letting you know what’s in store during the pre-season. The official Formula EVM rule book will dive deeper than I can in this introductory post, so stay tuned for that.\\n\\n**What is Formula EVM?**\\n\\nIt is a decentralized social competition where Layer 1 Blockchain networks are represented as teams that compete based on several performance metrics. Members (*Degen Racers*) select the team they believe will be in the top position by the end of the season, and work together within their team to get the W!\\n\\nEach team will be a separate DAO on their respective networks. Team members will work together to formulate, discuss and propose their *“Race Strategy”* to be voted on by the DAO members, and ultimately put into action. The *Race Strategy* is the team’s investment strategy, using the pooled funds raised when players entered the race. The performance of the *Race Strategies* will be the primary metric that will dictate the outcome of the Championship. The *Race Strategy* will be tweaked, voted on and implemented at the beginning of each *Grand-Prix Session* and will run until the subsequent Grand-Prix begins. The *Grand-Prix Main Events* will consist of live coverage of each team’s performance during the previous session, as well as live voting and full breakdowns of the following sessions’ *Race Strategies*.\\n\\nIn addition to points scored for *Race Strategy* performance, points will also be awarded at the conclusion of each Grand-Prix based on protocol performance such as market cap, coin value and wallet growth, and for team participation metrics.\\n\\n**The Grand-Prix Pool**\\n\\nAt the end of the Championship, each team stands to win their share of the Grand-Prix Pool. This prize pool consists of the accumulated entry-fees of all racers across all teams and is actively grown via the investment strategies employed by each team throughout the competition. The winning team will make out BIG, and will also be airdropped the First Annual Formula EVM World Champion Trophy NFT.\\n\\n**How to Join the Race?**\\n\\nAt the end of the Pre-Season we will release a collection of racecars, which we call *MetaMachines* in the form of an NFT on each L1. To select your team, go to our official NFT marketplace storefront on the respective network you’re joining and buy one of the team’s *MetaMachines* before they’re gone.\\n\\nThis NFT will be your license to join the race and will grant you private access to your team’s comms channels on Discord. In addition, it will also offer the holder a long and growing list of perks within the community such as whitelist status to get your *Degen Racer NFT Avatar* just prior to the official season kick-off.\\n\\nAn added advantage of joining the race (besides the sheer fun and massive prize pool) is that your membership to our community acts as an exclusive Alpha group where you can learn investment strategies, and get early picks from the industry's most degenerate investors.\\n\\n**The Teams**\\n\\nOur first season will consist of five teams competing head-to-head. These teams all share one thing in common, they are EVM or Ethereum Virtual Machine compatible. Meaning they are all interoperable, accessible through industry-standard Web3 tools, and therefore on a level playing field. And those teams are:\\n\\n***Ethereum***\\n\\n***Polygon***\\n\\n***Fantom***\\n\\n***Binance Smart Chain***\\n\\n***Cronos***\\n\\nDepending on the success of season 1, more teams may be added for season 2 such as Avalanche, Terra, and Harmony.\\n\\n**Pre-Season Run Down**\\n\\nThe Pre-Season is all about education, publicity, team formulation, and taking the concept for a test drive. Expect to see regular posts explaining various facets of the competition between now and our first Grand-Prix Session.\\n\\nTo warm up the track I will be running a small-scale *Sprint Race* that will provide a real-world example of how the competition will go down.\\n\\nI am bridging and swapping a total of 10ETH, consisting of 2ETH into each network’s native token, and employing my own investment strategy across a variety of yield farms, NFT collections, P2E games, and other promising projects. I will then report back to you on the performance of these strategies during the ***“Race Control - Pre-Season”*** livestreams, airing every Friday on **[Flote](https://flote.app)**, and other social networks.\\n\\nAlso around the corner is our Discord community where race-fans can begin to assemble and talk shop, the official FEVM rule-book that will be a collaborative effort from the DAO, and sneak peeks into our upcoming *MetaMachine* and *DegenRacer* NFT drops.\\n\\nTo stay in the know, check back here regularly and follow Rext Racer on the following networks: [Flote](https://flote.app/user/RextRacer) & [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ReXt_Racer)\\n\\nAlso follow Flote’s VP of Blockchain Experience [@LX on Flote](https://flote.app/user/LX). Alexander will be your Flote-based co-host on all things Formula EVM.\",\"timestamp\":1641591678,\"title\":\"Formula EVM Pre-Season Begins!\"},\"digest\":\"VASHdrm6wbwbaZPdwPls6livcHk7danXLU-FtEe7zvQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x90EDc34171b1750c36bF86D990bFc42889a73C6e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2DOGUfwVp_sbpFlc95YqXQX-LKz9prWAY_atKCPk7UE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ujejIPpv6dihSP69-OXRPbPZOAxGu5lmA5WpmGWLr8g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"qAmZONAjHMTO8GJSvRJRqtB0p_NpUy4YdHF1RJv859UKO15coOatd1h2YRrzOaE5ke4Ctbd4_8dFDCZnAiK_Yg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa9c1afca72fced7db62a4fd5a465ce4b703a4140718b93b7827863d81f1e1bb12e190e849b62c5d7b0e61992eb0d76aa4899a042c16a6fa5e422fa1a6e72ec551b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"2DOGUfwVp_sbpFlc95YqXQX-LKz9prWAY_atKCPk7UE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ujejIPpv6dihSP69-OXRPbPZOAxGu5lmA5WpmGWLr8g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gZ5PAesV1XnjWIGpFm2-rHXTTnCdV34WCRSeJEJUFDk\"}"
