"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The rain was falling, and chilled us to the bones.  You were crying bitterly.  And all that night and all the next day, aimless and hopeless, we wandered about the streets.  I must either die of want or return to your father.  I preferred death.  Toward evening--instinct having led me to the Seine--I sat down on one of the stone benches of the Point-Neuf, holding you on my knees and watching the flow of the dark river below.  There was a strange fascination--a promise of peace in its depths--that impelled me almost irresistibly to plunge into the flood.  If I had been alone in the world, I should not have stopped to consider a second, but on your account, Wilkie, I hesitated.\\\"\\n\\nMoved by the thought of the danger he had escaped, M. Wilkie shuddered.  \\\"B-r-r-r!\\\" he growled.  \\\"You did well to hesitate.\\\"\\n\\nShe did not even hear him, but continued: \\\"I at last decided that it was best to put an end to this misery, and rising with difficulty, I was approaching the parapet, when a gruff voice beside us exclaimed: 'What are you doing there?' I turned, thinking some police officer had spoken, but I was mistaken.  By the light of the street lamp, I perceived a man who looked some thirty years of age, and had a frank and rather genial face.  Why this stranger instantly inspired me with unlimited confidence I don't know.  Perhaps it was an unconscious horror of death that made me long for any token of human sympathy.  However it may have been, I told him my story, but not without changing the names, and omitting many particulars.  He had taken a seat beside me on the bench, and I saw big tears roll down his cheeks as I proceeded with my narrative.  'It is ever so! it is ever so!' he muttered.  'To love is to incur the risk of martyrdom.  It is to offer one's self as a victim to every perfidy, to the basest treason and ingratitude.'  The man who spoke in this fashion was Baron Trigault.  He did not allow me to finish my story.  'Enough!' he suddenly exclaimed, 'follow me!'  A cab was passing, he made us get in, and an hour later we were in a comfortable room, beside a blazing fire, with a generously spread table before us.  The next day, moreover, we were installed in a pleasant home.  Alas! why wasn't the baron generous to the last? You were saved, Wilkie, but at what a price!\\\"\\n\\nShe paused for a moment, her face redder than fire; but soon mastering her agitation, she resumed: \\\"There was one great cause of dissension between the baron and myself.  I wished you to be educated, Wilkie, like the son of a noble family, while he desired you should receive the practical training suited to a youth who would have to make his own way in the world, and win position, fortune, and even name for himself.  Ah! he was a thousand times right, as events have since proved only too well! But maternal love blinded me, and, after an angry discussion, he went away, declaring he would not see me again until I became more reasonable.  He thought that reflection would cure me of my folly.  Unfortunately, he was not acquainted with the fatal obstinacy which is the distinguishing characteristic of the Chalusse family.  While I was wondering how I could find the means of carrying the plans I had formed for you into execution, two of the baron's acquaintances presented themselves, with the following proposal: Aware of the enormous profits derived by clandestine gambling dens, they had conceived the project of opening a public establishment on a large scale, where any Parisian or foreigner, if he seemed to be a gentleman, and possessed of means, would find no difficulty in obtaining admission.  By taking certain precautions, and by establishing this gambling den in a private drawing-room, they believed the scheme practicable, and came to suggest that I should keep the drawing-room in question, and be their partner in the enterprise.  Scarcely knowing what I pledged myself to, I accepted their offer, influenced--I should rather say decided--by the exalted positions which both these gentlemen occupied, by the public consideration they enjoyed, and the honored names they bore.  And that same week this house was rented and furnished, and I was installed in it under the name of Lia d'Argeles.\\n\\n\\\"But this was not all.  There still remained the task of creating for myself one of those scandalous reputations that attract public attention.  This proved an easy task, thanks to the assistance of my silent partners, and the innocent simplicity of several of their friends and certain journalists.  As for myself, I did my best to insure the success of the horrible farce which was to lend infamous notoriety to the name of Lia d'Argeles.  I had magnificent equipages and superb dresses, and I made myself conspicuous at the theatres and all places of public resort.  As is generally the case when one is acting contrary to conscience, I called the most absurd sophistries to my assistance.  I tried to convince myself that appearances are nothing, that reality is everything, and that it did not matter if I were known as a courtesan since rumor lied, and my life WAS really chaste.  When the baron hastened to me and tried to rescue me from the abyss into which I had flung myself.  it was too late.  I had discovered that the business would prove successful; and for your sake, I longed for money as passionately, as madly, as any miser.  Last year my gaming-room yielded more than one hundred and fifty thousand francs clear profit, and I received as my share the thirty-five thousand francs which you squandered.  Now you know me as I really am.  My associates, my partners, the men whose secret I have faithfully kept, walk the streets with their heads erect.  They boast of their unsullied honor, and they are respected by every one.  Such is the truth, and I have no reason to make their disgrace known.  Besides, if I proclaimed it from the house-tops, no one would believe me.  But you are my son, and I owe you the truth, the whole truth!\\\"\\n\\nIn any age but the present, Madame d'Argeles's story would have seemed absolutely incredible.  Nowadays, however, such episodes are by no means rare.  Two men--two men of exalted rank and highly respected, to use a common expression--associate in opening a gaming-house under the very eyes of the police, and in coining money out of a woman's supposed disgrace.  'Tis after all but an everyday occurrence.\\n\\nThe unhappy woman had told her story with apparent coldness, and yet, in her secret heart, she perhaps hoped that by disclosing her terrible sacrifice and long martyrdom, she would draw a burst of gratitude and tenderness from her son, calculated to repay her for all her sufferings.  But the hope was vain.  It would have been  easier to draw water from a solid rock than to, extract a sympathetic tear from Wilkie's eyes.  He was only alive to the practical side of this narrative, and what impressed him most was the impudent assurance of Madame d'Argeles's business associates.  \\\"Not a bad idea; not bad at all,\\\" he exclaimed.  And, boiling over with curiosity, he continued: \\\"I would give something handsome to know those men's names.  Really you ought to tell me.  It would be worth one's while to know.\\\"\\n\\nAny other person than this interesting young man would have been crushed by the look his mother gave him--a look embodying the deepest disappointment and contempt.  \\\"I think you must be mad,\\\" she remarked coldly.  And as he sprang up, astonished that any one should doubt his abundant supply of good sense, \\\"Let us put an end to this,\\\" she sternly added.\\n\\nThereupon she hastily went into the adjoining room, reappearing a moment later with a roll of papers in her hand.  \\\"Here,\\\" she remarked, \\\"is my marriage certificate, your certificate of birth, and a copy of my renunciation--a perfectly valid document, since the court has authorized it, owing to my husband's absence.  All these proofs I am ready and willing to place at your disposal, but on one condition.\\\"\\n\\nThis last word fell like a cold shower-bath upon Wilkie's exultant joy.  \\\"What is this condition?\\\" he anxiously inquired.\\n\\n\\\"It is that you should sign this deed, which has been drawn up by my notary--a deed by which you pledge yourself to hand me the sum of two million francs on the day you come into possession of the Chalusse property.\\\"\\n\\nTwo millions! The immensity of the sum struck Wilkie dumb with consternation.  Nor did he forget that he would be compelled to give the Viscount de Coralth the large reward he had promised him-- a reward promised in writing, unfortunately.  \\\"I shall have nothing left,\\\" he began, piteously.\\n\\nBut with a disdainful gesture Madame d'Argeles interrupted him.  \\\"Set your mind at rest,\\\" said she.  \\\"You will still be immensely rich.  All the estimates which have been made are far below the mark.  When I was a girl I often heard my father say that his income amounted to more than eight hundred thousand francs a year.  My brother inherited the whole property, and I would be willing to swear that he never spent more than half of his income.\\\"\\n\\nWilkie's nerves had never been subjected to so severe a shock.  He tottered and his brain whirled.  \\\"Oh! oh!\\\" he stammered.  This was all he could say.\\n\\n\\\"Only I must warn you of a more than probable deception,\\\" pursued Madame d'Argeles.  \\\"As my brother was firmly resolved to deprive me even of my rightful portion of the estate, he concealed his fortune in every possible way.  It will undoubtedly require considerable time and trouble to gain possession of the whole.  However I know a man, formerly the Count de Chalusse's confidential agent, who might aid you in this task.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And this man's name?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is Isidore Fortunat.  I saved his card for you.  Here it is.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie took it up, placed it carefully in his pocket, and then exclaimed: \\\"That being the case, I consent to sign, but after this you need not complain.  Two millions at five per cent. ought to greatly alleviate one's sufferings.\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles did not deign to notice this delicate irony.  \\\"I will tell you in advance to what purpose I intend to apply this sum,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Ah!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I intend one of these two millions to serve as the dowry of a young girl who would have been the Count de Chalusse's sole legatee, if his death had not been so sudden and so unexpected.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the other one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The other I intend to invest for you in such a way that you can only touch the interest of it, so that you will not want for bread after you have squandered your inheritance, even to the very last penny.\\\"\\n\\nThis wise precaution could not fail to shock such a brilliant young man as M. Wilkie.  \\\"Do you take me for a fool?\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"I may appear very generous, but I am shrewd enough, never you fear.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Sign,\\\" interrupted Madame d'Argeles, coldly.\\n\\nBut he attempted to prove that he was no fool by reading and rereading the contract before he would consent to append his name to it.  At last, however, he did so, and stowed away the proofs which insured him the much-coveted property.\\n\\n\\\"Now,\\\" said Madame d'Argeles, \\\"I have one request to make of you.  Whenever your father makes his appearance and lays claim to this fortune, I entreat you to avoid a lawsuit, which would only make your mother's shame and the disgrace attached to the hitherto stainless name of Chalusse still more widely known.  Compromise with him.  You will be rich enough to satisfy his greed without feeling it.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie remained silent for a moment, as if he were deliberating upon the course he ought to pursue.  \\\"If my father is reasonable, I will be the same,\\\" he said at last.  \\\"I will choose as an arbiter between us one of my friends--a man who acts on the square, like myself--the Marquis de Valorsay.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My God! do you know him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is one of my most intimate friends.\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles had become very pale.  \\\"Wretched boy!\\\" she exclaimed.  \\\"You don't know that it's the marquis----\\\" She paused abruptly.  One word more and she would have betrayed Pascal Ferailleur's secret plans, with which she had been made acquainted by Baron Trigault.  Had she a right to do this, even to put her son on his guard against a man whom she considered the greatest villain in the world?\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\" insisted M. Wilkie, in surprise.\\n\\nBut Madame d'Argeles had recovered her self-possession.  \\\"I only wished to warn you against too close a connection with the Marquis de Valorsay.  He has an excellent position in society, but yours will be far more brilliant.  His star is on the wane; yours is just rising.  All that he is regretting, you have a right to hope for.  Perhaps even now he is jealous of you, and wishes to persuade you to take some false step.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah! you little know him!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have warned you.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie took up his hat, but, though he was longing to depart, embarrassment kept him to the spot.  He vaguely felt that he ought not to leave his mother in this style.  \\\"I hope I shall soon have some good news to bring you,\\\" he began.\\n\\n\\\"Before night I shall have left this house,\\\" she answered.\\n\\n\\\"Of course.  But you are going to give me your new address.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?--No!\\\"\\n\\nShe shook her head sadly, and in a scarcely audible voice  responded: \\\"It is not likely that we shall meet again.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And the two millions that I am to turn over to you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr. Patterson will collect the money.  As for me, say to yourself that I'm dead.  You have broken the only link that bound me to life, by proving the futility of the most terrible sacrifices.  However, I am a mother, and I forgive you.\\\"  Then as he did not move, and as she felt that her strength was deserting her, she dragged herself from the room, murmuring, \\\"Farewell!\\\"\\n\\nXVI.\\n\\nStupefied with astonishment, M. Wilkie stood for a moment silent and motionless.  \\\"Allow me,\\\" he faltered at last; \\\"Allow me--I wish to explain.\\\" But Madame d'Argeles did not even turn her head; the door closed behind her and he was left alone.\\n\\nHowever strong a man's nature may be, he always has certain moments of weakness.  For instance, at the present moment Wilkie was completely at a loss what to do.  Not that he repented, he was incapable of that; but there are hours when the most hardened conscience is touched, and when long dormant instincts at last assert their rights.  If he had obeyed his first impulse, he would have darted after his mother and thrown himself on his knees before her.  But reflection, remembrance of the Viscount de Coralth, and the Marquis de Valorsay, made him silent the noblest voice that had spoken in his soul for many a long day.  So, with his head proudly erect, he went off, twirling his mustaches and followed by the whispers of the servants--whispers which were ready to change into hisses at any moment.\\n\\nBut what did he care for the opinion of these plebeians!  Before he was a hundred paces from the house his emotion had vanished, and he was thinking how he could most agreeably spend the time until the hour appointed for his second interview with M. de Valorsay.  He had not breakfasted, but \\\"his stomach was out of sorts,\\\" as he said to himself, and it would really have been impossible for him to swallow a morsel.  Thus not caring to return home, he started in quest of one of his former intimates, with the generous intention of overpowering him with the great news.  Unfortunately he failed to find this friend, and eager to vent the pride that was suffocating him, in some way or other, he entered the shop of an engraver, whom he crushed by his importance, and ordered some visiting cards bearing the inscription W. de Gordon- Chalusse, with a count's coronet in one of the corners.\\n\\nThus occupied, time flew by so quickly that he was a trifle late in keeping his appointment with his dear friend the marquis.  Wilkie found M. de Valorsay as he had left him--in his smoking- room, talking with the Viscount de Coralth.  Not that the marquis had been idle, but it had barely taken him an hour to set in motion the machinery which he had had in complete readiness since the evening before.  \\\"Victory!\\\" cried Wilkie, as he appeared on the threshold.  \\\"It was a hard battle, but I asserted my rights.  I am the acknowledged heir! the millions are mine!\\\" And without giving his friends time to congratulate him, he began to describe his interview with Madame d'Argeles, presenting his conduct in the most odious light possible, pretending he had indulged in all sorts of harsh rejoinders, and making himself out to be \\\"a man of bronze,\\\" or \\\"a block of marble,\\\" as he said.\\n\\n\\\"You are certainly more courageous than I fancied,\\\" said M. de Valorsay gravely, when the narrative was ended.\\n\\n\\\"Is that really so?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is, indeed.  Now the world is before you.  Let your story be noised abroad--and it will be noised abroad--and you will become a hero.  Imagine the amazement of Paris when it learns that Lia d'Argeles was a virtuous woman, who sacrificed her reputation for the sake of her son--a martyr, whose disgrace was only a shameful falsehood invented by two men of rank to increase the attractions of their gambling-den! It will take the newspapers a month to digest this strange romance.  And whom will all this notoriety fall upon? Upon you, my dear sir; and as your millions will lend an additional charm to the romance, you will become the lion of the season.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie was really too much overwhelmed to feel elated.  \\\"Upon my word, you overpower me, my dear marquis--you quite overpower me,\\\" he stammered.\\n\\n\\\"I too have been at work,\\\" resumed the marquis.  \\\"And I have made numerous inquiries, in accordance with my promise.  I almost regret it, for what I have discovered is--very singular, to say  the least.  I was just saying so to Coralth when you came in.  What I have learned makes it extremely unpleasant for me, to find myself mixed up in the affair; accordingly, I have requested the persons who gave me this information to call here.  You shall hear their story, and then you must decide for yourself.\\\" So saying, he rang the bell, and as soon as a servant answered the summons, he exclaimed: \\\"Show M. Casimir in.\\\"\\n\\nWhen the lackey had retired to carry out this order, the marquis remarked: \\\"Casimir was the deceased count's valet.  He is a clever fellow, honest, intelligent, and well up in his business--such a man as you will need, in fact, and I won't try to conceal the fact that the hope of entering your service has aided considerably in unloosening his tongue.\\\"\\n\\nM. Casimir, who was irreproachably clad in black, with a white cambric tie round his neck, entered the room at this very moment, smiling and bowing obsequiously.  \\\"This gentleman, my good fellow,\\\" said M. de Valorsay, pointing to Wilkie, \\\"is your former master's only heir.  A proof of devotion might induce him to keep you with him.  What you told me a little while ago is of great importance to him; see if you can repeat it now for his benefit.\\\"\\n\\nIn his anxiety to secure a good situation, M. Casimir had ventured to apply to the Marquis de Valorsay; he had talked a good deal, and the marquis had conceived the plan of making him an unsuspecting accomplice.  \\\"I never deny my words,\\\" replied the valet, \\\"and since monsieur is the heir to the property, I won't hesitate to tell him that immense sums have been stolen from the late count's estate.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie bounded from his chair.  \\\"Immense sums!\\\" he exclaimed.  \\\"Is it possible!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur shall judge.  On the morning preceding his death, the count had more than two millions in bank-notes and bonds stowed away in his escritoire, but when the justice of the peace came to take the inventory, the money could not be found.  We servants were terribly alarmed, for we feared that suspicion would fall upon us.\\\"\\n\\nAh! if Wilkie had only been alone he would have given vent to his true feelings.  But here, under the eyes of the marquis and M. de Coralth, he felt that he must maintain an air of stoical indifference.  He ALMOST succeeded in doing so, and in a tolerably firm voice he remarked: \\\"This is not very pleasant news.  Two millions! that's a good haul.  Tell me, my friend, have you any clue to the thief?\\\"\\n\\nThe valet's troubled glance betrayed an uneasy conscience, but he had gone too far to draw back.  \\\"I shouldn't like to accuse an innocent person,\\\" he replied, \\\"but there was some one who constantly had access to that escritoire.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And who was that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mademoiselle Marguerite.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know the lady.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She's a young girl who is--at least people say--the count's illegitimate daughter.  Her word was law in the house.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What has become of her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She has gone to live with General de Fondege, one of the count's friends.  She wouldn't take her jewels and diamonds away with her, which seemed very strange, for they are worth more than a hundred thousand francs.  Even Bourigeau said to me: 'That's unnatural, M. Casimir.' Borigeau is the concierge of the house, a very worthy man.  Monsieur will not find his equal.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1640139856,\"title\":\"This was the final blow!
