"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"That looks like a bailiff,\\\" said Lady Albury, laughing. Colonel Stubbs, declaring that he had no special reason to be afraid of any bailiff, left the room and went down into the hall.\\n\\nAt Stalham the real hall of the house was used as a billiard-room, and here, leaning against the billiard table, the Colonel found poor Faddle. When a man is compelled by some chance circumstance to address another man whom he does not know, and whom by inspection he feels he shall never wish to know, he always hardens his face, and sometimes also his voice. So it was with the Colonel when he looked at Faddle. A word he did say, not in words absolutely uncivil, as to the nature of the business in hand. Then Faddle, showing his emotion by a quaver in his voice, suggested that as the matter was one of extreme delicacy some more private apartment might be provided. Upon this Stubbs led the way into a little room which was for the most part filled with hunting gear, and offered the stranger one of the three chairs which it contained. Faddle sat down, finding himself so compelled, though the Colonel still remained standing, and then extracted the fatal epistle from his pocket. \\\"Colonel Stubbs,\\\" said he, handing up the missive, \\\"I am directed by my friend, Mr Thomas Tringle, junior, to put this letter into your own hand. When you have read it I shall be ready to consult with you as to its contents.\\\" These few words he had learnt by heart on his journey down, having practised them continually.\\n\\nThe Colonel took the letter, and turning to the window read it with his back to the visitor. He read it twice from beginning to end in order that he might have time to resolve whether he would laugh aloud at both Faddle and Tringle, or whether it might not be better to endeavour to soften the anger of poor Tom by a message which should be at any rate kindly worded. \\\"This is from my friend, Tom Tringle,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"From Mr Thomas Tringle, junior,\\\" said Faddle, proudly.\\n\\n\\\"So I perceive. I am sorry to think that he should be in so much trouble. He is one of the best fellows I know, and I am really grieved that he should be unhappy. This, you know, is all nonsense.\\\" \\\"It is not nonsense at all, Colonel Stubbs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must allow me to be the judge of that, Mr Faddle. It is at any rate nonsense to me. He wants me to go somewhere and fight a duel -- which I should not do with any man under any circumstances. Here there is no possible ground for any quarrel whatsoever -- as I will endeavour to explain, myself, to my friend, Mr Tringle. I shall be sure to write to him at once -- and so I will bid you good afternoon.\\\"\\n\\nBut this did not at all suit poor Faddle after so long a journey. \\\"I thought it probable that you would write, Colonel Stubbs, and therefore I am prepared to wait. If I cannot be accommodated here I will wait -- will wait elsewhere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That will not be at all necessary. We have a post to London twice a day.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You must be aware, Colonel Stubbs, that letters of this sort should not be sent by post.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The kind of letter I shall write may be sent by post very well. It will not be bellicose, and therefore there can be no objection.\\\" \\\"I really think, Colonel Stubbs, that you are making very little of a very serious matter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Mr Faddle, I really must manage my own affairs after my own way. Would you like a glass of sherry? If not, I need hardly ask you to stay here any longer.\\\" Upon that he went out into the billiard-room and rang the bell. Poor Faddle would have liked the glass of sherry, but he felt that it would be incompatible with the angry dignity which he assumed, and he left the house without another word or even a gesture of courtesy. Then he returned to London, having taken his bag and dress coat all the way to Stalham for nothing.\\n\\nTom's letter was almost too good to be lost, but there was no one to whom the joke could be made known except Lady Albury. She, he was sure, would keep poor Tom's secret as well as his own, and to her he showed the letter. \\\"I pity him from the bottom of my heart,\\\" he said. Lady Albury declared that the writer of such a letter was too absurd for pity. \\\"Not at all. Unless he really loved her he wouldn't have been so enraged. I suppose he does think that I injured him. He did tell me his story, and I didn't tell him mine. I can understand it all, though I didn't imagine he was such a fool as to invite me to travel all round the world because of the harsh laws of Great Britain. Nevertheless, I shall write to him quite an affectionate letter, remembering that, should I succeed myself, he will be my first cousin by marriage.\\\"\\n\\nBefore he went to bed that night he wrote his letter, and the reader may as well see the whole correspondence:\\n\\nMY DEAR TRINGLE,\\n\\nIf you will think of it all round you will see that you have got no cause of quarrel with me any more than I have with you. If it be the case that we are both attached to your cousin, we must abide her decision whether it be in favour of either of us, or, as may be too probably the case, equally adverse to both of us. If I understand your letter rightly, you think that I behaved unfairly when I did not tell you of my own affairs upon hearing yours from your own lips. Why should I? Why should I have been held to be constrained to tell my secret because you, for your own sake, had told me yours? Had I been engaged to your cousin -- which I regret to say is very far from the case -- I should have told you, naturally. I should have regarded the matter as settled, and should have acquainted you with a fact which would have concerned you. But as such was not a fact, I was by no means bound to tell you how my affairs stood. This ought to be clear to you, and I hope will be when you have read what I say.\\n\\nI may as well go on to declare that under no circumstances should I fight a duel with you. If I thought I had done wrong in the matter I would beg your pardon. I can't do that as it is -- though I am most anxious to appease you -- because I have done you no wrong.\\n\\nPray forget your animosity -- which is in truth unfounded -- and let us be friends as we were before.\\n\\nYours very sincerely,\\n\\nJONATHAN STUBBS\\n\\nFaddle reached London the evening before the Colonel's letter, and again dined with his friend at Bolivia's. At first they were both extremely angry, acerbating each other's wrath. Now that he was safe back in London Faddle thought that he would have enjoyed an evening among the \\\"swells\\\" of Stalham, and felt himself to be injured by the inhospitable treatment he had received -- \\\"after going all the way down there, hardly to be asked to sit down.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not asked to sit down!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, yes, I was -- on a miserable cane-bottomed chair in a sort of cupboard. And he didn't sit down. You may call them swells, but I think your Colonel Stubbs is a very vulgar sort of fellow. When I told him the post isn't the proper thing for such a letter, he only laughed. I suppose he doesn't know what is the kind of thing among gentlemen.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should think he does know,\\\" said Tom.\\n\\n\\\"Then why doesn't he act accordingly? Would you believe it; he never so much as asked me whether I had a mouth on. It was just luncheon time, too.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose they lunch late.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They might have asked me. I shouldn't have taken it. He did say something about a glass of sherry, but it was in that sort of tone which tells a fellow that he is expected not to take it. And then he pretended to laugh. I could see that he was shaking in his shoes at the idea of having to fight. He go to the torrid zone! He would much rather go to a police office if he thought that there was any fighting on hand. I should dust his jacket with a stick if I were you.\\\"\\n\\nLater on in the evening Tom declared that this was what he would do, but, before he came to that, a third bottle of Signor Bolivia's champagne had been made to appear. The evening passed between them not without much enjoyment. On the opening of that third cork the wine was declared to be less excellent than what had gone before, and Signor Bolivia was evoked in person. A gentleman named Walker, who looked after the establishment, made his appearance, and with many smiles, having been induced to swallow a bumper of the compound himself, declared, with a knowing shake of the head and an astute twinkle of the eye, that the wine was not equal to the last. He took a great deal of trouble, he assured them, to import an article which could not be surpassed, if it could be equalled, in London, always visiting Epernay himself once a year for the purpose of going through the wine-vaults. Let him do what he would an inferior bottle -- or, rather, a bottle somewhat inferior -- would sometimes make its way into his cellar. Would Mr Tringle let him have the honour of drawing another cork, so that the exact amount of difference might be ascertained? Tom gave his sanction; the fourth cork was drawn; and Mr Walker, sitting down and consuming the wine with his customers, was enabled to point out to a hair's breadth the nature and the extent of the variation. Tringle still thought that the difference was considerable. Faddle was, on the whole, inclined to agree with Signor Bolivia. It need hardly be said that the four bottles were paid for -- or rather scored against Tringle, who at the present time had a little account at the establishment.\\n\\n\\\"Show a fellar fellar's letters morrer.\\\" Such or something like it was Faddle's last request to his friend as they bade each other farewell for the night in Pall Mall. But Faddle was never destined to see the Colonel's epistle. On his attempting to let himself in at Badminton Gardens, he was kidnapped by his father in his night-shirt and dressing-gown; and was sent out of London on the following morning by long sea down to Aberdeen, whither he was intrusted to the charge of a stern uncle. Our friend Tom saw nothing more of his faithful friend till years had rolled over both their heads.\\n\\nBy the morning post, while Tom was still lying sick with headache -- for even with Signor Bolivia's wine the pulling of many corks is apt to be dangerous -- there came the letter from the Colonel. Bad as Tom was, he felt himself constrained to read it at once, and learned that neither the torrid zone or Arctic circle would require his immediate attendance. He was very sick, and perhaps, therefore, less high in courage than on the few previous days. Partly, perhaps, from that cause, but partly, also, from the Colonel's logic, he did find that his wrath was somewhat abated. Not but what it was still present to his mind that if two men loved the same girl as ardently, as desperately, as eternally as he loved Ayala, the best thing for them would be to be put together like the Kilkenny cats, till whatever remnant should be left of one might have its chance with the young lady. He still thought that it would be well that they should fight to the death, but a glimmering of light fell upon his mind as to the Colonel's abnegation of all treason in the matter. \\\"I suppose it wasn't to be expected that he should tell,\\\" he said to himself. \\\"Perhaps I shouldn't have told in the same place. But as to forgetting animosity that is out of the question! How is a man to forget his animosity when two men want to marry the same girl?\\\"\\n\\nAbout three o'clock on that day he dressed himself, and sat waiting for Faddle to come to him. He knew how anxious his friend would be to see the Colonel's letter. But Faddle by this time had passed the Nore, and had added seasickness to his other maladies. Faddle came to him no more, and the tedious hours of the afternoon wore themselves away in his lodgings till he found his solitude to be almost more unbearable than his previous misfortunes. At last came the time when he must go out for his dinner. He did not dare to attempt the Mountaineers. And as for Bolivia, Bolivia with his corks, and his eating-house, and his vintages, was abominable to him. About eight o'clock he slunk into a quiet little house on the north side of Oxford Street, and there had two mutton chops, some buttered toast, and some tea. As he drank his tea he told himself that on the morrow he would go back to his mother at Merle Park, and get from her such consolation as might be possible.\\n\\nCHAPTER 37 GERTRUDE IS UNSUCCESSFUL\\n\\nIt was now the middle of January, and Gertrude Tringle had received no reply from her lover to the overture which she had made him. Nor, indeed, had she received any letter from him since that to which this overture had been a reply. It was now two months since her proposition had been made, and during that time her anger had waxed very hot against Mr Houston. After all, it might be a question whether Mr Houston was worth all the trouble which she, with her hundred thousand pounds, was taking on his behalf. She did not like the idea of abandoning him, because, by doing so, she would seem to yield to her father. Having had a young man of her own, it behoved her to stick to her young man in spite of her parents. But what is a girl to do with a lover who, at the end of two months, has made no reply to an offer from herself that he should run away with her, and take her to Ostend? She was in this frame of mind when, lo and behold, she found her own letter, still inclosed in her own envelope -- but opened, and thrust in among her father's papers. It was evident enough that the letter had never passed from out of the house. There had been treachery on the part of some servant -- or perhaps her father might have condescended to search the little box -- or, more probable still, Augusta had betrayed her! Then she reflected that she had communicated her purpose to her sister, that her sister had abstained from any questions since the letter had been written, and that her sister, therefore, no doubt, was the culprit. There, however, was the letter, which had never reached her lover's hands, and, as a matter of course, her affections returned with all their full ardour to the unfortunate ill-used man. That her conduct was now watched would, she thought, be a matter of course. Her father knew her purpose, and, like stern parents in general, would use all his energies to thwart it. Sir Thomas had, in truth, thought but little about the matter since he had first thrust the letter away. Tom's troubles, and the disgrace brought by them upon Travers and Treason generally, had so occupied his mind that he cared but little for Gertrude and her lover. But Gertrude had no doubt that she was closely watched, and in these circumstances was driven to think how she could best use her wits so as to countermine her father. To run away from Queen's Gate would, she thought, be more difficult, and more uncomfortable, than to perform the same operation at Merle Park. It was intended that the family should remain in the country, at any rate, till Easter, and Gertrude resolved that there might yet be time for another effort before Easter should be past, if only she could avoid those hundred Argus eyes, which were, no doubt, fixed upon her from all sides.\\n\\nShe prepared another letter to her lover, which she addressed to him at his club in London. In this she told him nothing of her former project, except that a letter written by her in November had fallen in to the hands of enemies. Then she gave him to understand that there was need of the utmost caution; but that, if adequate caution were used, she did not doubt they might succeed. She said nothing about her great project, but suggested to him that he should run down into Sussex, and meet her at a certain spot indicated, outside the Park palings, half an hour after dusk. It might be, she said, impossible that the meeting should be effected, but she thought that she could so manage as to leave the house unwatched at the appointed hour. With the object of being especially safe she began and concluded her letter without any names, and then managed to deposit it herself in the box of the village post-office.\\n\\nHouston, when he received this letter, at once made up his mind that he would not be found on the outer side of the Park palings on the evening named. He told himself that he was too old for the romance of love-making, and that should he be received, when hanging about in the dark, by some custodian with a cudgel, he would have nothing to thank but his own folly. He wrote back therefore to say that he regarded the outside of the Park palings as indiscreet, but that he would walk up through the lodge gate to the house at three o'clock in the afternoon of the day named, and he would take it as an additional mark of her favour if she would meet him on the road. Gertrude had sent him a mysterious address; he was to direct the letter to \\\"O.P.Q., Post Office, Hastings,\\\" and she was prepared to hire a country boy to act as Love's messenger on the occasion. But of this instruction Frank took no notice, addressing the letter to Merle Park in the usual way.\\n\\nGertrude received her letter without notice from anyone. On that occasion Argus, with all his eyes, was by chance asleep. She was very angry with her lover -- almost determined to reject him altogether, almost disposed to yield to her angry parents and look out for some other lover who might be accepted in better part; but still, when the day came she put on her hat and walked down the road towards the lodge.\\n\\nAs Fortune had it -- Fortune altogether unfavourable to those perils for which her soul was longing -- no one watched her, no one dogged her steps, no one took any notice of her, till she met Frank Houston when he had passed about a hundred yards through the gates. \\\"And so you have come,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, yes; I have come. I was sure to come when I said so. No man is more punctual than I am in these matters. I should have come before -- only I did not get your letter.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Frank!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, my darling. You are looking uncommonly well, and I am so glad to see you. How are they all?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frank!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Frank, what are we to do?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The governor will give way at last, I should say.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Never -- that is while we are as we are now. If we were married -- \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah -- I wish we were! Wouldn't it be nice?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Do you really think so?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course I do. I'm ready tomorrow for the matter of that.\\\" \\\"But could you do something great?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Something great! As to earning my bread, you mean? I do not think I could do that. I didn't turn my hand to it early enough.\\\" \\\"I wasn't thinking of -- your bread.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You said -- could I do something great?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Frank, I wrote you a letter and described it all. How I got the courage to do it I do not know. I feel as though I could not bring myself to say it now. I wonder whether you would have the courage.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I should say so. I don't know quite what sort of thing it is; but I generally have pluck enough for anything in a common way.\\\" \\\"This is something in an uncommon way.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639991355,\"title\":\"\\n\\\"Yes, Sir;\\\" said the servant. \\\"He says he has a letter which he must put into your own particular hands.\\\" \"},\"digest\":\"m7xP6rPVOebPDK5hAPexhIrUManN9bjjdgOQJADDm_4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x104C9415d8cF60006fA1f2ecb12Aa1B60108c24D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QZeSETSHSJeM026AC4_lE4E7olvhMHiFjTJCCgYuBD0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g97xJhtzceEXQAlxJvBHtW-18JaOrZdNp_mU6eBH0TM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_a4cUE7Fv_HRv1iY3YNgxEekpRbSjtT6QPsNGKQAkxSKuW0J1YguQFHNDgRnzxH-jY90ofoTFKFt26hoArFemQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8f5c76f27e07d99e7d354d580fe09ea3291c61542a265ce0b8a956e1def0b98e7d832991c78955a60c9b5d538ca71d3810dfa955d85b4a711bc0dbd1e921c2e81b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"QZeSETSHSJeM026AC4_lE4E7olvhMHiFjTJCCgYuBD0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"g97xJhtzceEXQAlxJvBHtW-18JaOrZdNp_mU6eBH0TM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m7xP6rPVOebPDK5hAPexhIrUManN9bjjdgOQJADDm_4\"}"
