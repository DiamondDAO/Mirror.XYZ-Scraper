Being nice is its own reward most of the time.\\n\\n> One of the most underrated skills in business right now is being nice. Nice sells.\\n>\\n> *Mark Cuban*\\n\\n* If you need help, to whom would you instead go? The nice person.\\n* If you want advice, to whom would you instead go? The nice person.\\n* If you want to catch up, to who would you instead go? The nice person.\\n\\nPeople like nice people. Do not confuse being nice with being slimy, with somebody who constantly does lip service, who tells you what you want to hear. None of these things is about being nice. It might look nice and feel nice, though people will see through it and know it is disingenuous. People do not like deceitful people.\\n\\n## Don’t hold back\\n\\nIf you are nice, it doesn’t mean that you need to hold back. You can be nice and honest, nice and direct, nice and open, nice and disagreeable. It is how you behave. It is how much you care about the other. Since if you are just honest but not nice, you are just being mean.\\n\\nBe nice. It doesn’t cost you anything extra. Niceness might be the best investment in your career. If you can interact with people, give them a good feeling, and resolve conflicts in a manner both parties value, you become an even more precious person.\\n\\nOver time, your valuation pays out. Unfriendly people only go so far. Niceness has endless longevity. And as with most investments, time in the market beats timing in the market.\\n\\nBe nice in 2022.\\n\\n*Photo by Engin Akyurt on [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/photo/assorted-color-umbrellas-1486861/)*\",\"timestamp\":1641978563,\"title\":\"Be nice\"},\"digest\":\"13CFCX3KByg2_9yz_Snx2QSkZB4BmLeYhFfC97WhI6s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x29293165253e7F4c4703110F3fF90DdE50fD417E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Pp_20dGJsIB9ryv0HsgmRXtW0D3CFTH3f5UpoRNT9AI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NahRwZVv8q149LNz9WYodLddOe88FsXi01mUn_Z3Fl8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8nBWS28P_IFS2Uwi6Cwd-e01vgV_1c9M3f6NstlH8wy5xQ5VO2mgEXZ-ShIrWoXG5_QFXIyvfF1CP6QaL0bk5g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7d375a3ba10246d8501fdc3a91a2654e54bd8889948289bbc5bbe34c8660f7bd251fd3f04321c62c3008877920ae554eedc42b630960e8b11f61c52e1b630b3a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Pp_20dGJsIB9ryv0HsgmRXtW0D3CFTH3f5UpoRNT9AI\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"NahRwZVv8q149LNz9WYodLddOe88FsXi01mUn_Z3Fl8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KJGa_krtlgCQTM3XLMX2V_LWpvz0bWdctNExZ7-5B2Y\"}"
