"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[Kristen Stewart](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/kristen-stewart/) has announced her engagement to screenwriter Dylan Meyer.\\n\\nOn Tuesday’s episode of SiriusXM’s *The Howard Stern Show*, the *[Spencer](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/spencer/)* star said: “We’re marrying, we’re totally gonna do it.”\\n\\nThe 31-year-old actor said previously that she’d met Meyer on the set of a movie but lost touch until they reconnected at a mutual friend’s birthday party six years later, in the summer of 2019. They’ve been spotted together — occasionally sporting rings that generated engagement rumors in July of this year — ever since.\\n\\n“I wanted to be proposed to, so I think I very distinctly carved out what I wanted and she nailed it. It was very cute. She did very well,” Stewart told Stern.\\n\\nAccording to NBC News, Stewart’s hopes for the wedding include a relaxed, intimate ceremony in her and her fiancee’s hometown. “I want to stay home. I want to be in L.A. so everyone can come, and … I want it to be pretty chill. I don’t want anyone walking anyone down any aisles. Like, we’re just gonna stand, do vows.”\\n\\nMeyer wrote the screenplay for Netflix teen drama *[Moxie](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/moxie-film-review-4140159/)*, which is directed by Amy Poehler and stars Hadley Robinson. The film follows a shy 16-year-old who publishes an anonymous zine calling out sexism at her school.\\n\\nStewart’s *Spencer*, directed by Pablo Larrain and telling the story of Princess Diana’s decision to end her marriage to Prince Charles, releases Nov. 5 in theaters.\",\"timestamp\":1635905840,\"title\":\"Kristen Stewart Reveals Engagement to Screenwriter Dylan Meyer\"},\"digest\":\"pCYZ0ht84jqmWCQvUF-4wY63PCVzJL3OMcJdv7Jl6KQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x15b7224118C75406C38Dee327A0a4C8390EfF138\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tAT1pAKryMw0nLu3zZsIiwGeVMftyJf3eY3Ov3ffv1c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Tam4RtNhHcDr_HaxSJEi49TrxwwQBmd5XUlfmo7w3QQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"VamSyvIvx-N9vdjRBPgcBscx_VQPnvAJFGq6WrTDz-Px5grW6tFi2YZfKGnc_8noXuZGigTq-mEmczmM8FhQcA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb4c76f0f56c9b37f13d442d139500ab2b7a836484f77a755d34c232f4a8c141e27b036f374d5fd9df1b63d7726fa8d750764706a6e91378e8119af859aabfea31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tAT1pAKryMw0nLu3zZsIiwGeVMftyJf3eY3Ov3ffv1c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Tam4RtNhHcDr_HaxSJEi49TrxwwQBmd5XUlfmo7w3QQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"pCYZ0ht84jqmWCQvUF-4wY63PCVzJL3OMcJdv7Jl6KQ\"}"
