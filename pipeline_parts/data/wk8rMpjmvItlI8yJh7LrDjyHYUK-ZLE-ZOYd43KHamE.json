"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## Counting my privileges, wishing everyone had them\\n\\nHello, my name is Nate. [My home](https://medium.com/@nathanborson/my-cabins-ears-77ab5a3dc32d) is in [Gustavus, Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustavus,_Alaska), in the [Tlingit Huna Kwan homeland](https://www.nps.gov/articles/aps-v13-i1-c7.htm), on the edge of a [vast wilderness area](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/72), but I am writing this from [McMurdo Station,](https://www.usap.gov/videoclipsandmaps/mcmwebcam.cfm) where I am applying my computer skills this austral summer in the service of the US Antarctic Program. I’m an [IT Pro](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-borson-77987426/) by trade, having worked as a computer specialist for [Glacier Bay National Park](https://www.nps.gov/glba) for 23 years and having co-owned a tiny computer and communications consulting business for nine years. Before I lucked into this line of work, I guided sea kayak trips (I co-founded [Spirit Walker Expeditions](https://seakayakalaska.com/), still in operation under new ownership more than 30 years later), processed fish and crab at a seafood plant, washed dishes, cooked, drove, installed burglar alarms, worked as a ranch hand, and installed solar hot water systems.\\n\\n![Wilderness adventuring with good friends in my big back yard is my favorite pastime.

Even before my semi-retirement I arranged my life to spend my (boreal) summers sea kayaking, camping, hiking, and backpacking in my big, wild back yard. I love the sense of personal discovery that comes from finding something special that I did not expect. I seek out destinations I have not heard about, and I have often been where I felt I might be the first person to set foot. I treasure my time in habitats teeming with wildlife, my perception zooming out to take in the vast web of life in which humans are just one strand.\\n\\n![Pondering. Photo of and by Nathan Borson.](https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1\\\\*mzLbOi0MpVyCbhxMtmNm3A.png)\\n\\nI am a [systems](https://complexsystemstheory.net/complexity-explorer/) thinker. I deeply ponder reality and “my” part of it. I have become highly skeptical about self, free will, consciousness, individuality, and duality. Once proud to be independent and self-reliant, I am now grateful to be an infinitesimal but very lucky part of a \\\\*whole \\\\*so great I cannot conceive it.\\n\\n> What is so special about you? What do you have that you were not given? And if it was given to you, how can you brag?[1 CORINTHIANS 4:7](https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/1%20Corinthians%204%3A7)\\n\\nI have surrendered any concept that I deserve or earned my great fortune — my freedom and leisure, my physical and mental health, my financial security, my great friendships and community, and my awesome family. The truth is I hit the jackpot in the birth lottery, and my luck has compounded ever since. It’s not that I haven’t worked hard or given back, but the very fact that I am \\\\*able \\\\*to do so is a result of my nature and nurture, gifts for which I can take no credit.\\n\\nIt pays to be a “[white](https://medium.com/message/how-white-people-got-made-6eeb076ade42)” male born in America in the early sixties to caring, respectful, mentally healthy middle-class [parents](https://medium.com/family-matters-2/sayings-my-father-shunned-5ddde0e74541). It also pays to be lucky. I wish my success derived less from historical and continuing racial injustice and from a lottery system that rewards good luck while further impoverishing those who suffer a bad break. I wish my privileges did not arise in part from others’ subjugation and loss, notably the dispossession of the Sioux who had lived on the land my family farmed in Minnesota. I believe there are fairer systems that ultimately result in greater prosperity and happiness for everyone. I believe with privilege come obligations. I hope to explore some of these topics in my writing.\\n\\n![Another selfie by the author](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*ouINk-ZOBZ3VqAOrWYDpJw.png)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633890484,\"title\":\"About Me — Nathan Borson\"},\"digest\":\"DWxAdM1HGN72LZcPDbipaiznOhiyfM1jDFP3MQTFB4Q\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0fc55c3FD7D7DbEE09CDF50e6E5Ec7cd2d1dA639\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HgrjYSBPWT7VS_egiawRcGsa2XyuVdvZYt5Sqw8LZF0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w598LzWs_oAciUTacGFlbaQ2rn_sK9ROcc8D_XMqXzc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"G8HpMKK6b6KEm0R_MIlrzp3D4XIM1mJZGTqEXkdw0_xAq81VC_2K0EipE3sDOSeZF7FcVVJmx4-OJ4FFiTkjqw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6f3e30e1a47751038337b82f44eec480e04da1420931b89e68194992d5f5b6976aa27cdad43630933edff528d87db4d8955a8d98356f9e8013d1a4d6dc870fb51c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"HgrjYSBPWT7VS_egiawRcGsa2XyuVdvZYt5Sqw8LZF0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w598LzWs_oAciUTacGFlbaQ2rn_sK9ROcc8D_XMqXzc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DWxAdM1HGN72LZcPDbipaiznOhiyfM1jDFP3MQTFB4Q\"}"
