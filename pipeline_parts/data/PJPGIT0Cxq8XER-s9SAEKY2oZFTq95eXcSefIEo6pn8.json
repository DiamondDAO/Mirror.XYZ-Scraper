"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"![Twitter: @drex_jpg](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2VZKMHdokGAHBLhfIfbwi.png?height=900&width=1600)\\n\\nIn Naval’s famous thread [How to Get Rich (without getting lucky)](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936) my favorite tweet is.\\n\\n***“You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.”***\\n\\nComing from a traditional finance background as an analyst I remember this tweet really hitting home. I realized that I was renting out my time for money and not realizing any of the upside that I was responsible for within my firm. While I always recommended stocks that I thought had the best opportunity for capital appreciation I came to the realization that regardless of the performance of the stock I still got paid the same amount.  I could recommend a company that would go bankrupt or that went up 10x and my paycheck was always the same. Like most people that have annual salaries and fixed paychecks, there’s limited upside. You’re playing a **linear game** where it’s hard to reach escape velocity to becoming wealthy. The way I could start to increase my chances of reaching exponential returns came through investing in public companies and crypto. Most companies allow you to invest via your 401k but never allow you to **own equity in the business that you’re contributing to** unless you are a founder. DAO’s introduce a different incentive structure that isn’t available in traditional companies. They allow you to own equity from the very beginning of your contribution and allow you to get in on the ground floor. This type of skin in the game is what is most exciting to me about DAO’s.\\n\\n### **Ownership Economy**\\n\\nThe best way I’ve heard DAO’s explained is [Cooper Turleys](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw) definition\\n\\n> **“*DAOs are internet communities with a shared bank account and ownership*.”**\\n\\nDAO’s introduce a new corporate structure similar to an LLC. As a16z puts it\\n\\n> **\\\"DAOs are internet-native, global collectives that share resources, build products, and work together toward common goals.\\\"**\\n\\nWhen I think about DAO's it reminds me a lot of the traditional startup model. **Startups are movements to a different future.** Startup markets start at zero and then a movement happens and the movement accelerates and the market emerges from the movement. A startup isn't a company (yet) it is a set of founders with proprietary insights as a result of them **living in the future.** What I think makes DAO's so special is it eliminates the friction of the traditional startup model and it creates an internet native equivalent. It allows for communities to collaborate on an idea and share ownership from the very beginning. When people have skin in the game from the beginning they are ultimately incentivized to bring value to the DAO. There's no better way to recruit talent than by offering equity, silicon valley has figured this out long ago. Working for ownership is a model that aligns the incentives of the community and allows those contributing most to the DAO to be compensated accordingly.\\n\\nThe ownership economy is fueled by tokens. These are new digital primitives.\\n\\n[https://mobile.twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619](https://mobile.twitter.com/cdixon/status/1440026947036356619)\\n\\n### Permissionless Contribution\\n\\nWhile there are barriers to entry in order to join a start-up, DAO's allow for a permissionless approach where you can start contributing to the community, generating proposals, and participating in idea generation right away. Not only are you contributing to building something but you're also incentivized by the actual ownership in what you're creating. An example that gets thrown out a lot is, imagine if the early Uber drivers that contributed to building the network (driving the cars) got paid in Uber stock instead. This type of ground-up ownership makes bootstrapping a project a lot easier as the ones contributing to it are incentivized to evangelize it.\\n\\n**Web2:** Build products in an attempt to find community. **Web3:** Community builds products together.\\n\\n![Web 3 Playbook: Chris Dixon Thread](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/j6DUYUebzgCvLimOHl3GJ.png?height=293&width=576)\\n\\nBy introducing tokens, it adds financial utility to the equation which makes it easier to get off the ground. By providing tokens to bootstrap networks properly incentivizing early adopters. This is one of the biggest unlocks that web3 enables. I would argue that tokens don't just add better utility to users, but also accelerate the rate of adoption as network effects are a lot stronger when people are financially incentivized. Imagine if the first social networks distributed tokens for the amount of time spent on the platform, and you could earn tokens based on the engagement of your posts. Not only would users be financially incentivized to give the platform a try but also it adds to the stickiness of the platform making users not want to leave.\\n\\n### Future of Work\\n\\nIt's pretty obvious that since the COVID the world has been more open to remote work. Now that we've proved we can do it, it's hard to put the genie back in the bottle. People are already opting out of jobs that aren't remote and I think that trend will continue in the future due to the optionality being remote allows. Not being tied to a physical location is another reason why I think DAO's will play a big role in future companies. They are internet natives and their headquarters is on the internet and not any physical location. I think there's a high probability that generations to come that grow up with crypto will opt into working for these organizations structured by smart contracts and token incentives. On a long enough timeline, I wouldn't be surprised to see the next evolution of big tech giants emerge from the DAO structure.\\n\\n**More Recommended Resources on DAO’s**\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/episode/1hnyUNXZMWzPnd5oE5HMAi?si=XwOtTIPISg-YrNy-BxL2rg](https://open.spotify.com/episode/1hnyUNXZMWzPnd5oE5HMAi?si=XwOtTIPISg-YrNy-BxL2rg)\\n\\n[https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/_EDyn4cs9tDoOxNGZLfKL7JjLo5rGkkEfRa_a-6VEWw)\\n\\n[https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-join-a-dao](https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/how-to-join-a-dao)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636409596,\"title\":\"Own Your Upside: DAOs\"},\"digest\":\"vwN-VXXbJEvNfZccZxmNFOid3WQJgJx04Oy-V0v9vyg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7baa35903E27BB818E9A4c40B20110B710c86ACb\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jKhmHpX4UY_aL0imIr7WqRMwkiOMWyFFoZbpOpdKfvk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rAO3swVLgwe-cHpNCdHHUtW5AxjOtIFV7mhobAypfRY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FxvVyRl18gETSNStEGcX4Gedw5WTFAuP4uPIpbSSLv343eLTjHz9_iEMV3oingExhBWF-2lpRAQn1yOyalGYeQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2c4e588c991e6f813c66f8b4dedee3db6884277879bd0b49e3505b87529b6f8b1a5926e7148c0d338d6395722c724003167212a7cc205ea3f41b9a36e19ec4c01b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jKhmHpX4UY_aL0imIr7WqRMwkiOMWyFFoZbpOpdKfvk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"rAO3swVLgwe-cHpNCdHHUtW5AxjOtIFV7mhobAypfRY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dQGnkqqB8EYaQVyuBDcFCXfSl6YdQU-hqGZVPlfAUlQ\"}"
