Iâ€™ve been working remotely for the past two years, not just because of the obvious AKA the pandemic, but because itâ€™s the kind of job that allows me to plan the lifestyle that I like best.\\n\\nLetâ€™s get into it,Â *remote work*, most ofÂ us have heard of it by now, but many questions remain. Who does it? Do they just not talk to people? Do they work from their beds, with cereal on their pajamas?\\n\\nWorking remotely is on the rise, and more people than ever are taking their job outside of a corporate office. While having the ability to work from outside of a corporate office has been feasible for a few decades, working remotely is only now becoming mainstream. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about remote work, the real scoop!\\n\\nRemote work has only become more accessible to us, thanks to the digital age and the ever-increasing amount of tools available to facilitate remote teamwork, such as Slack, Skype, Basecamp and Google Docs.The earning potential that comes with working remotely is a huge contributor to its popularity, plus the flexibility that comes with it as people are getting paid for not needing to physically be at their job every day.\\n\\nGiven that remote employees arenâ€™t cooped up in an office all day, they have much more time than the average worker to dedicate to their education in order to expand their field. Furthermore, because remote workers are not burdened with the same schedule as a traditional employee, they have time to pursue hobbies such as painting or tennis.\\n\\nSimply put, remote employees experience far less stress, which leads to greater employee morale. When workers can work from the comfort of their own home, theyâ€™re less likely to feel uneasy or stressed out in the face of pressure at work. The ability to control your schedule and environment as a remote worker has a positive effect on your well being and overall health, and boosts productivity at the same time.\\n\\nIndependent workers, freelancers and remote employees are the new face of business in todayâ€™s digital age.\\n\\nIf youâ€™re switching your career path to become a remote worker, or if youâ€™re a remote worker looking to brush up on the latest trends and technologies, here are several questions you should ask yourself first.\\n\\nHow will I work remotely? How is remote work any different than my traditional office style work? How do my company accommodates and scale its workforce when everyone is spread all over the globe? Will I feel confortable doing so? And what are some misconceptions about remote work that keep me from making the jump?\",\"timestamp\":1641315682,\"title\":\"How does remote work, actually works out?\"},\"digest\":\"aFd9E0jTCXv0-ToRq6xpIvjV6AWqvaoV4e5-QNxzKo8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdD2215D65512a420733A1E10E5Cf8409Ba313A86\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"L31MDBx2Owp0iPGwXGnHqKgeOZveX-gfdTJQFNPcUMo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SPBCvM8AnhAkaHYarhwO3uWs9bKIzCNdStBSRjQPaUo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LbxCfvxozq0rDOohhuJvui_Rp3I7OLa4mh89DwedB5ST8CMTnmoHTyk3WYhsbk7d7JOZ0IoAXDPXb9ZjSoH-Wg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x72f2ce4262176fc98c833ff37ce827b2062f524bf3d3c147f031dbdba6768fc4422acd7fcfceff4ddcee89f4c2ea7bc4d39408eb1a567bc545b9956f08eff9881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"L31MDBx2Owp0iPGwXGnHqKgeOZveX-gfdTJQFNPcUMo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"SPBCvM8AnhAkaHYarhwO3uWs9bKIzCNdStBSRjQPaUo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3mFPwqbLOSxVVj1I9d3lR5Hk-CQ3JaiReFmd8ToAJhQ\"}"
