"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"she arranged herself to receive her guests.  From among all her dresses, she chose the same dark robe she had worn on the night when Pascal Ferailleur was ruined at her house; and as she was even paler than usual, she tried to conceal the fact by a prodigal use of rouge.  At ten o'clock, when the first arrivals entered the brilliantly lighted rooms, they found her seated as usual on the sofa, near the fire, with the same eternal, unchangeable smile upon her lips.  There were at least forty persons in the room, and the gambling had become quite animated when the baron entered.  Madame d'Argeles read in his eyes that he was the bearer of good news.  \\\"Everything is going on well,\\\" he whispered, as he shook hands with her.  \\\"I have seen M. Ferailleur--I wouldn't give ten sous for Valorsay's and Coralth's chances.\\\"\\n\\nThis intelligence revived Madame d'Argeles's drooping spirits, and she received M. de Coralth with perfect composure when he came to pay his respects to her soon afterward.  For he had the impudence to come, in order to dispel any suspicions that might have been aroused anent his complicity in the card-cheating affair.  The hostess's calmness amazed him.  Was she still ignorant of her brother's death and the complications arising from it, or was she only acting a part? He was so anxious and undecided, that instead of mingling with the groups of talkers, he at once took a seat at the card-table, whence he could watch the poor woman's every movement.\\n\\nBoth rooms were full, and almost everybody was engaged in play, when, shortly after midnight, a servant entered the room, whispered a few words in his mistress's ear, and handed her a card.  She took it, glanced at it, and uttered so harsh, so terrible, so heart-broken a cry, that several of the guests sprang to their feet.  \\\"What is it? What is it?\\\" they asked.  She tried to reply, but could not.  Her lips parted, she opened her mouth, but no sound came forth.  She turned ghastly white under her rouge, and a wild, unnatural light gleamed in her eyes.  One curious guest, without a thought of harm, tried to take the card, which she still held in her clinched hand; but she repulsed him with such an imperious gesture that he recoiled in terror.  \\\"What is it? What is the matter with her?\\\" was the astonished query on every side.\\n\\nAt last, with a terrible effort, she managed to reply, \\\"Nothing.\\\" And then, after clinging for a moment to the mantel-shelf, in order to steady herself, she tottered out of the room.\\n\\nVII.\\n\\nIt was not enough to tell M. Wilkie the secret of his birth.  He must be taught how to utilize the knowledge.  The Viscount de Coralth devoted himself to this task, and burdened Wilkie with such a host of injunctions, that it was quite evident he had but a poor opinion of his pupil's sagacity.  \\\"That woman d'Argeles,\\\" he thought, \\\"is as sharp as steel.  She will deceive this young idiot completely, if I don't warn him.\\\"\\n\\nSo he did warn him; and Wilkie was instructed exactly what to do and say, how to answer any questions, and what position to take up according to circumstances.  Moreover, he was especially enjoined to distrust tears, and not to let himself be put out of countenance by haughty airs.  The Viscount spent at least an hour in giving explanations and advice, to the great disgust of M. Wilkie, who, feeling that he was being treated like a child, somewhat testily declared that he was no fool, and that he knew how to take care of himself as well as any one else.  Still, this did not prevent M. de Coralth from persisting in his instructions until he was persuaded that he had prepared his pupil for all possible emergencies.  He then rose to depart.  \\\"That's all, I think,\\\" he remarked, with a shade of uneasiness.  \\\"I've traced the plan--you must execute it, and keep cool, or the game's lost.\\\"\\n\\nHis companion rose proudly.  \\\"If it fails, it won't be from any fault of mine,\\\" he answered with unmistakable petulance.\\n\\n\\\"Lose no time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There's no danger of that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And understand, that whatever happens, my name is not to be mentioned.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If there should be any new revelations, I will inform you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"At the club?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but don't be uneasy; the affair is as good as concluded.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I hope so, indeed.\\\"\\n\\nWilkie gave a sigh of relief as he saw his visitor depart.  He wished to be alone, so as to brood over the delights that the future had in store for him.  He was no longer to be limited to a paltry allowance of twenty thousand francs! No more debts, no more ungratified longings.  He would have millions at his disposal! He seemed to see them, to hold them, to feel them gliding in golden waves between his fingers! What horses he would have! what carriages! what mistresses! And a gleam of envy that he had detected in M. de Coralth's eyes put the finishing touch to his bliss.  To be envied by this brilliant viscount, his model and his ideal, what happiness it was!\\n\\nThe reputation that Madame d'Argeles bore had at first cast a shadow over his joy; but this shadow had soon vanished.  He was troubled by no foolish prejudices, and personally he cared little or nothing for his mother's reputation.  The prejudices of society must, of course, be considered.  But nonsense! society has no prejudices nowadays when millionaires are concerned, and asks no questions respecting their parents.  Society only requires passports of the indigent.  Besides, no matter what Madame d'Argeles might have done, she was none the less a Chalusse, the descendant of one of the most aristocratic families in France.\\n\\nSuch were Wilkie's meditations while he was engaged in dressing himself with more than usual care.  He had been quite shocked by the suggestion that Madame d'Argeles might try to deny him, and he wished to appear before her in the most advantageous light.  His toilette was consequently a lengthy operation.  However, shortly after twelve o'clock he was ready.  He cast a last admiring glance at himself in the mirror, twirled his mustaches, and departed on his mission.  He even went on foot, which was a concession to what he considered M. de Coralth's absurd ideas.  The aspect of the Hotel d'Argeles, in the Rue de Berry, impressed him favorably, but, at the same time, it somewhat disturbed his superb assurance.  \\\"Everything is very stylish here,\\\" he muttered.\\n\\nA couple of servants--the concierge and Job--were standing at the door engaged in conversation.  M. Wilkie approached them, and in his most imposing manner, but not without a slight tremble in his voice, requested to see Madame d'Argeles.  \\\"Madame is in the country,\\\" replied the concierge; \\\"she will not return before this evening.  If monsieur will leave his card \\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! that's quite unnecessary.  I shall be passing again.\\\"\\n\\nThis, too, was in obedience to the instructions of M. de Coralth, who had advised him not to send in his name, but to gain admission into Madame d'Argeles's presence as speedily as possible, without giving her time to prepare herself for the interview; and Wilkie had ultimately decided that these precautions might not prove as superfluous as he had at first supposed.  But this first mishap annoyed him extremely.  What should he do? how should he kill time till the evening? A cab was passing.  He hired it for a drive to the Bois, whence he returned to the boulevards, played a game of billiards with one of the co-proprietors of Pompier de Nanterre, and finally dined at the Cafe Riche, devoting as much time as possible to the operation.  He was finishing his coffee when the clock struck eight.  He caught up his hat, drew on his gloves, and hastened to the Hotel d'Argeles again.\\n\\n\\\"Madame has not yet returned,\\\" said the concierge, who knew that his mistress had only just risen from her bed, \\\"but I don't think it will be long.  And if monsieur wishes--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" replied M. Wilkie brusquely, and he was going off in a furious passion, when, on crossing the street, he chanced to turn his head and notice that the reception rooms were brilliantly lighted up.  \\\"Ah! I think that a very shabby trick!\\\" grumbled the intelligent youth.  \\\"They won't succeed in playing that game on me again.  Why, she's there now!\\\"\\n\\nIt occurred to him that Madame d'Argeles had perhaps described him to her servants, and had given them strict orders not to admit him.  \\\"I'll find out if that is the case, even if I have to wait here until to-morrow morning,\\\" he thought, angrily.  However, he had not been on guard very long, when he saw a brougham stop in front of the mansion, whereupon the gate opened, as if by enchantment.  The vehicle entered the courtyard, deposited its occupants, and drove away.  A second carriage soon appeared, then a third, and then five or six in quick succession.  \\\"And does she think I'll wear out my shoe-leather here, while everybody else is allowed to enter?\\\" he grumbled.  \\\"Never!--I've an idea.\\\" And, without giving himself time for further deliberation, he returned to his rooms, arrayed himself in evening-dress, and sent for his carriage.  \\\"You will drive to No.--in the Rue de Berry,\\\" he said.  \\\"There is a soiree there, and you can drive directly into the courtyard.\\\"  The coachman obeyed, and M. Wilkie realized that his idea was really an excellent one.\\n\\nAs soon as he alighted, the doors were thrown open, and he ascended a handsome staircase, heavily carpeted, and adorned with flowers.  Two liveried footmen were standing at the door of the drawing-room, and one of them advanced to relieve Wilkie of his overcoat, but his services were declined.  \\\"I don't wish to go in,\\\" said the young man roughly.  \\\"I wish to speak with Madame d'Argeles in private.  She is expecting me--inform her.  Here is my card.\\\"\\n\\nThe servant was hesitating, when Job, suspecting some mystery perhaps, approached.  \\\"Take in the gentleman's card,\\\" he said, with an air of authority; and, opening the door of a small room on the left-hand side of the staircase, he invited Wilkie to enter, saying, \\\"If monsieur will be kind enough to take a seat, I will summon madame at once.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie sank into an arm-chair, considerably overcome.  The air of luxury that pervaded the entire establishment, the liveried servants, the lights and flowers, all impressed him much more deeply than he would have been willing to confess.  And in spite of his affected arrogance, he felt that the superb assurance which was the dominant trait in his character was deserting him.  In his breast, moreover, in the place where physiologists locate the heart, he felt certain extraordinary movements which strongly resembled palpitations.  For the first time it occurred to him that this woman, whose peace he had come to destroy, was not only the heiress of the Count de Chalusse's millions, but also his mother, that is to say, the good fairy whose protection had followed him everywhere since he entered the world.  The thought that he was about to commit an atrocious act entered his mind, but he drove it away.  It was too late now to draw back, or even to reflect.\\n\\nSuddenly a door opposite the one by which he had entered opened, and Madame d'Argeles appeared on the threshold.  She was no longer the woman whose anguish and terror had alarmed her guests.  During the brief moment of respite which fate had granted her, she had summoned all her energy and courage, and had mastered her despair.  She felt that her salvation depended upon her calmness, and she had succeeded in appearing calm, haughty, and disdainful--as impassive as if she had been a statue.  \\\"Was it you, sir, who sent me this card?\\\" she inquired.\\n\\nGreatly disconcerted, M. Wilkie could only bow and stammer out an almost unintelligible answer.  \\\"Excuse me! I am much grieved, upon my word! I disturb you, perhaps----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are Monsieur Wilkie!\\\" interrupted Madame d'Argeles, in a tone of mingled irony and disdain.\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" he replied, drawling out the name affectedly, \\\"I am M. Wilkie.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you desire to speak with me?\\\" inquired Madame d'Argeles, dryly.\\n\\n\\\"In fact--yes.  I should like----\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well.  I will listen to you, although your visit is most inopportune, for I have eighty guests or more in my drawing-room.  Still, speak!\\\"\\n\\nIt was very easy to say \\\"speak,\\\" but unfortunately for M. Wilkie he could not articulate a syllable.  His tongue was as stiff, and as dry, as if it had been paralyzed.  He nervously passed and repassed his fingers between his neck and his collar, but although this gave full play to his cravat, his words did not leave his throat any more readily.  For he had imagined that Madame d'Argeles would be like other women he had known, but not at all.  He found her to be an extremely proud and awe-inspiring creature, who, to use his own vocabulary, SQUELCHED him completely.  \\\"I wished to say to you,\\\" he repeated, \\\"I wished to say to you----\\\" But the words he was seeking would not come; and, so at last, angry with himself, he exclaimed: \\\"Ah! you know as well as I, why I have come.  Do you dare to pretend that you don't know?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him with admirably feigned astonishment, glanced despairingly at the ceiling, shrugged her shoulders, and replied: \\\"Most certainly I don't know--unless indeed it be a wager.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A wager!\\\" M. Wilkie wondered if he were not the victim of some practical joke, and if there were not a crowd of listeners hidden somewhere, who, after enjoying his discomfiture, would suddenly make their appearance, holding their sides.  This fear restored his presence of mind.  \\\"Well, then,\\\" he replied, huskily, \\\"this is my reason.  I know nothing respecting my parents.  This morning, a man with whom you are well acquainted, assured me that I was--your son.  I was completely stunned at first, but after a while I recovered sufficiently to call here, and found that you had gone out.\\\"\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a nervous laugh from Madame d'Argeles.  For she was heroic enough to laugh, although death was in her heart, and although the nails of her clinched hands were embedded deep in her quivering flesh.  \\\"And you believed him, monsieur?\\\" she exclaimed.  \\\"Really, this is too absurd! I--your mother! Why, look at me----\\\"\\n\\nHe was doing nothing else, he was watching her with all the powers of penetration he possessed.  Madame d'Argeles's laugh had an unnatural ring that awakened his suspicions.  All Coralth's recommendations buzzed confusedly in his ears, and he judged that the moment had come \\\"to do the sentimental,\\\" as he would have expressed it.  So he lowered his head, and in an aggrieved tone, exclaimed: \\\"Ah! you think it very amusing, I don't.  Do you realize how wretched it makes one to live as utterly alone as a leper, without a soul to love or care for you? Other young men have a mother, sisters, relatives.  I have no one! Ah! if---- But I only have friends while my money lasts.\\\" He wiped his eyes, dry as they were, with his handkerchief, and in a still more pathetic tone, resumed: \\\"Not that I want for anything; I receive a very handsome allowance.  But when my relatives have given me the wherewithal to keep me from starving, they imagine their duty is fulfilled.  I think this very hard.  I didn't come into the world at my own request, did I? I didn't ask to be born.  If I was such an annoyance to them when I came into existence, why didn't they throw me into the river? Then they would have been well rid of me, and I should be out of my misery!\\\"\\n\\nHe stopped short, struck dumb with amazement, for Madame d'Argeles had thrown herself on her knees at his feet.  \\\"Have mercy!\\\" she faltered; \\\"Wilkie; my son, forgive me!\\\" Alas! the unfortunate woman had failed in playing a part which was too difficult for a mother's heart.  \\\"You have suffered cruelly, my son,\\\" she continued; \\\"but I--I--Ah! you can't conceive the frightful agony it costs a mother to separate from her child! But you were not deserted, Wilkie; don't say that.  Have you not felt my love in the air around you? YOU forgotten? Know, then, that for years and years I have seen you every day, and that all my thoughts and all my hopes are centered in you alone! Wilkie!\\\"\\n\\nShe dragged herself toward him with her hands clasped in an agony of supplication, while he recoiled, frightened by this outburst of passion, and utterly amazed by his easily won victory.  The poor woman misunderstood this movement.  \\\"Great God!\\\" she exclaimed, \\\"he spurns me; he loathes me.  Ah! I knew it would be so.  Oh! why did you come? What infamous wretch sent you here? Name him, Wilkie! Do you understand, now, why I concealed myself from you? I dreaded the day when I should blush before you, before my own son.  And yet it was for your sake.  Death would have been a rest, a welcome release for me.  But your breath was ebbing away, your poor little arms no longer had strength to clasp me round the neck.  And then I cried: 'Perish my soul and body, if only my child can be saved!' I believed such a sacrifice permissible in a mother.  I am punished for it as if it were a crime.  I thought you would be happy, my Wilkie.  I said to myself that you, my pride and joy, would move freely and proudly far above me and my shame.  I accepted ignominy, so that your honor might be preserved intact.  I knew the horrors of abject poverty, and I wished to save my son from it.  I would have licked up the very mire in your pathway to save you from a stain.  I renounced all hope for myself, and I consecrated all that was noble and generous in my nature to you.  Oh! I will discover the vile coward who sent you here, who betrayed my secret.  I will discover him and I will have my revenge! You were never to know this, Wilkie.  In parting from you, I took a solemn oath never to see you again, and to die without the supreme consolation of feeling your lips upon my forehead.\\\"\\n\\nShe could not continue; sobs choked her utterance.  And for more than a minute the silence was so profound that one could hear the sound of low conversation in the hall outside, the exclamations of the players as they greeted each unexpected turn of luck, and occasionally a cry of \\\"Banco!\\\" or \\\"I stake one hundred louis!\\\" Standing silent and motionless near the window, Wilkie gazed with consternation at Madame d'Argeles, his mother, who was crouching in the middle of the room with her face hidden in her hands, and sobbing as if her heart would break.  He would willingly have given his third share in Pompier de Nanterre to have made his escape.  The strangeness of the scene appalled him.  It was not emotion that he felt, but an instinctive fear mingled with commiseration.  And he was not only ill at ease, but he was angry with himself for what he secretly styled his weakness.  \\\"Women are incomprehensible,\\\" he thought.  \\\"It would be so easy to explain things quietly and properly, but they must always cry and have a sort of melodrama.\\\"\\n\\nSuddenly the sound of footsteps near the door roused him from his stupor.  He shuddered at the thought that some one might come in.  He hated the very idea of ridicule.  So summoning all his courage he went toward Madame d'Argeles, and, raising her from the floor, he exclaimed: \\\"Don't cry so.  You grieve me, upon my word! Pray get up.  Some one is coming.  Do you hear me? Some one is coming.\\\" Thereupon, as she offered no resistance, he half led, half carried her to an arm-chair, into which she sank heavily.  \\\"Now she is going to faint!\\\" thought Wilkie, in despair.  What should he do? Call for help? He dared not.  However, necessity inspired him.  He knelt at Madame d'Argeles's feet, and gently said: \\\"Come, come, be reasonable! Why do you give way like this? I don't reproach you!\\\"\\n\\nSlowly, with an air of humility which was indescribably touching, she took her hands from her face, and for the first time raised her tear-stained eyes to her son's.  \\\"Wilkie,\\\" she murmured.\\n\\n\\\"Madame!\\\"\\n\\nShe heaved a deep sigh, and in a half-stifled voice:\\n\\n\\\"MADAME!\\\" she repeated.  \\\"Will you not call me mother?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, of course--certainly.  But--only you know it will take me some time to acquire the habit.  I shall do so, of course; but I shall have to get used to it, you know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"True, very true!--but tell me it is not mere pity that leads you to make this promise? If you should hate me--if you should curse me--how should I bear it! Ah! when a woman reaches the years of understanding one should never cease repeating to her: 'Take care! Your son will be twenty some day, and you will have to meet his searching gaze.  You will have to render an account of your honor to him!' My God! If women thought of this, they would never sin.  To be reduced to such a state of abject misery that one dares not lift one's head before one's own son! Alas! Wilkie, I know only too well that you cannot help despising me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, indeed.  Not at all! What an idea!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Tell me that you forgive me!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do, upon my word I do.\\\"\\n\\nPoor woman, her face brightened.  She so longed to believe him! And her son was beside her, so near that she felt his breath upon her cheek.  It was he indeed.  Had they ever been separated? She almost doubted it, she had lived so near him in thought.  It was with a sort of ecstasy that she looked at him.  There was a world of entreaty in her eyes; they seemed to be begging a caress; she raised her quivering lips to his, but he did not observe it.  For a long time she hesitated, fearing he might spurn her; but at last, yielding to a supreme impulse, she threw her arms around his neck, drew him toward her, and pressed him to her heart in a close embrace.  \\\"My son! my son!\\\" she repeated; \\\"to have you with me again, after all these years!\\\"\\n\\nUnfortunately, no whirlwind of passion was capable of carrying M. Wilkie beyond himself.  His emotion was now spent and his mind had regained its usual indifference.  He flattered himself that he was a man of mettle--and he remained as cold as ice beneath his mother's kisses.  Indeed, he barely tolerated them; and if he did allow her to embrace him, it was only because he did not know how to refuse.  \\\"Will she never have done?\\\" he thought.  \\\"This is a pretty state of things! I must be very attractive.  How Costard and Serpillon would laugh if they saw me now.\\\" Costard and Serpillon were his intimate friends, the co-proprietors of the famous steeplechaser.\\n\\nIn her rapture, however, Madame d'Argeles did not observe the peculiar expression on her son's face.  She had compelled him to take a chair opposite her, and, with nervous volubility, she continued: \\\"If I don't deny myself the happiness of embracing you again, it is because I have not broken the vow I took never to make myself known to you.  When I entered this room, I was firmly resolved to convince you, no matter how, that you had been deceived.  God knows that it was not my fault if I did not succeed.  There are some sacrifices that are above human strength.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie deigned to smile.  \\\"Oh! yes, I saw your little game,\\\" he said, with a knowing air.  \\\"But I had been well posted, and besides, it is not very easy to fool me.\\\"\\n\\nMadame d'Argeles did not even hear him.  \\\"Perhaps destiny is weary of afflicting us,\\\" she continued; \\\"perhaps a new life is about to begin.  Through you, Wilkie.  I can again be happy.  I, who for years have lived without even hope.  But will you have courage to forget?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\nShe hung her head, and in an almost inaudible voice replied, \\\"The past, Wilkie.\\\"\\n\\nBut with an air of the greatest indifference, he snapped his fingers, and exclaimed: \\\"Nonsense! What is past is past.  Such things are soon forgotten.  Paris has known many such cases.  You are my mother; I care very little for public opinion.  I begin by pleasing myself, and I consult other people afterward; and when they are dissatisfied, I tell them to mind their own business.\\\"\\n\\nThe poor woman listened to these words with a joy bordering on rapture.  One might have supposed that the strangeness of her son's expressions would have surprised her--have enlightened her in regard to his true character--but no.  She only saw and understood one thing--that he had no intention of casting her off, but was indeed ready to devote himself to her.  \\\"My God!\\\" she faltered, \\\"is this really true? Will you allow me to remain with you? Oh, don't reply rashly! Consider well, before you promise to make such a sacrifice.  Think how much sorrow and pain it will cost you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I have considered.  It is decided--mother.\\\"\\n\\nShe sprang up, wild with hope and enthusiasm.  \\\"Then we are saved!\\\" she cried.  \\\"Blessed be he who betrayed my secret! And I doubted your courage, my Wilkie! At last I can escape from this hell! This very night we will fly from this house, without one backward glance.  I will never set foot in these rooms again--the detested gamblers who are sitting here shall never see me again.  From this moment Lia d'Argeles is dead.\\\"\\n\\nM. Wilkie positively felt like a man who had just fallen from the clouds.  \\\"What, fly?\\\" he stammered.  \\\"Where shall we go, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To a country where we are unknown, Wilkie--to a land where you will not have to blush for your mother.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Trust yourself to me, my son.  I know a pleasant village near London where we can find a refuge.  My connections in England are such that you need not fear the obstacles one generally meets with among foreigners.  M. Patterson, who manages a large manufacturing establishment, will, I know, be happy to be of service to us--but we shall not be indebted to any one for long, now that you have resolved to work.\\\"\\n\\nOn hearing these words, M. Wilkie sprang up in dismay.  \\\"Excuse me,\\\" he said, \\\"I don't understand you.  You propose to set me to work in M. Patterson's factory?  Well, to tell the truth, that doesn't suit me at all.\\\"\\n\\nIt was impossible to mistake M. Wilkie's manner, his tone, or gesture.  They revealed him in his true character.  Madame d'Argeles saw her terrible mistake at once.  The bandage fell from her eyes.  She had taken her dreams for realities, and the desires of her own heart for those of her son.  She rose, trembling with sorrow and with indignation.  \\\"Wilkie!\\\" she exclaimed, \\\"Wilkie, wretched boy! what did you dare to hope?\\\"\\n\\nAnd, without giving him time to reply, she continued: \\\"Then it was only idle curiosity that brought you here.  You wished to know the source of the money which you spend like water.  Very well, you may see for yourself.  This is a gambling house; one of those establishments frequented by distinguished personages, which the police ignore, or which they cannot suppress.  The hubbub you hear is made by the players.  Men are ruined here.  Some poor wretches have blown their brains out on leaving the house; others have parted with the last vestige of honor here.  And the business pays me well.  One louis out of every hundred that change hands falls to my share.  This is the source of your wealth, my son.\\\"\\n\\nThis anger, which succeeded such deep grief--this outburst of disdain, following such abject humility--considerably astonished M. Wilkie.  \\\"Allow me to ask----\\\" he began.\",\"timestamp\":1640139614,\"title\":\"at about seven o'clock on Monday evening, although still grievously suffering both in mind and body\"},\"digest\":\"dVv9Bmd97ZpkQVuodpMaEgP5Lof3hKvSNlEL0UMbi3U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x368119602f169B8146fb749c112EF9CC81197C53\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nnQaOcytISkars7z-Run-5x4CVnJ9LaJxuA6VXAIwWU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zwIPQtL7jO6L_c_03k32oqYk2XtK79ENk0e8N4UTtjo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aN9M6LOc8ZsoUttCVlRUG6Bib8Kj3Ce5md40kxyouHVY_9kavgPe9B3UngLcLJfkeYIC5WQ8zZUmKg_52GeJEw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2d2a843dbb99b59f515b3b361c547c8d1049a6bee5f2fd405d0942942448eb690a8921abe2ae50d60ea053bdad6fc5ae690687dd077ace708bef3ef13083d9ec1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nnQaOcytISkars7z-Run-5x4CVnJ9LaJxuA6VXAIwWU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zwIPQtL7jO6L_c_03k32oqYk2XtK79ENk0e8N4UTtjo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"dVv9Bmd97ZpkQVuodpMaEgP5Lof3hKvSNlEL0UMbi3U\"}"
