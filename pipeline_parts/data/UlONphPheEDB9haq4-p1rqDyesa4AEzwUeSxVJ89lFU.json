"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Everybody knows **ENS domains**. And everyone knows that you can also store text records (*hopefully everyone knows it!*). With those data dApps can easily enrich wallets. But what was missing for me? A web3 profile page, with which I can enrich my data **without gas costs**. Comparable with [bio.link](https://bio.link) or [linktree](https://linktr.ee/). Biggest difference: decentralized, and it's your data and not mine.\\n\\nAt first I asked myself the question: why do you actually need this? The answer was (at least for me) quite simple: identity is probably the most important asset, I want to have that **completely under my control**. Now before everyone starts screaming: sure, that ship has sailed. We're all on Twitter or LinkedIn. But well, you have to start somewhere! So why not now. And of course everyone can create their own page and then store the IPFS content hash under their ENS domain. But even for that you need some basic technical knowledge. Why not create a simple way to change text or URLs without gas costs. Here we go.\\n\\nSo how does the data get to the profile page? There are exactly two sources: **ENS and IPFS**. The ENS text records are available anyway and are read and displayed accordingly. The IPFS data is used for additional enrichment. You can set what you want with it. It is also possible to set an avatar and a header image.\\n\\nThis is the short story behind [ethme](https://ethme.at). I will also write a blog post in the next days, how [ethme](https://ethme.at) is technically implemented.\\n\\nHave fun!\",\"timestamp\":1640182225,\"title\":\"ETHme - your chic web3 identity\"},\"digest\":\"5zbMobc_npUw4n7GmSvjB_61mI558Rpm0yJ-YDXNQws\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xA3Fa175140C9779D5293e876a9c71Ef10A7a0bd2\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BcxJSfK0btMaV0i4AWc8vmlgs4vTcLm7o74bTP2uIjs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"41NjbjptGp78P9DYtzZ9awbWlyBmXqVC2BxsPyMKQN0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"s1dNEf-FE9tyCjR_ZcqspbZhTypNIaFtVcD6AiptBXk_M3Fn-EHXh4CgRU5gNCX5xxqzfzp-IgoMC9QH1l_sbQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xad8652ccfa66194228866029e8a28f57642f2f4d8bad8367cc2886b7adcf7c1f42434fe5f76347e98423a10970638227990b5d5fc723abf46c5610d0ed7c07511c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BcxJSfK0btMaV0i4AWc8vmlgs4vTcLm7o74bTP2uIjs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"41NjbjptGp78P9DYtzZ9awbWlyBmXqVC2BxsPyMKQN0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5zbMobc_npUw4n7GmSvjB_61mI558Rpm0yJ-YDXNQws\"}"
