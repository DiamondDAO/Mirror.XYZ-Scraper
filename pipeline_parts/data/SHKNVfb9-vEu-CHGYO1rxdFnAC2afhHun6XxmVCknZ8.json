"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The first day when I go to high school, I felt excited, after 9 years’ study, I felt I was so close to university, the dream always gives me motivation to move on. The first year, I made many friends, I got to know all of my classmates, though the study was hard and tedious, I shared happiness and sorrow with my friends. When the second year came, I was arranged to another class, for the need of my major. I was a little frustrated at first, because I was worried no one could talk to me, but I made new friends quickly, sometimes I would keep in touch with my old friends. Now the last year has come, I must study hard, I will go to college next year, never have I felt so close to my dream. High school life is not easy for me, for the pressure is so heavy, but I won’t give up.\",\"timestamp\":1639034637,\"title\":\"High School Life\"},\"digest\":\"l4yrCb0Z2JSTc4MvQrCKqL-HA9Qz5NJgUoGO2Qg15D0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6c21B191114F04F356a510C6Dbf6cc402E283889\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wsv2eKAUBD8E9JlGCnmLI-tWC66HFnIl2zNUJsHVIX4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9FKb7v5SsMGuJ_-zSM5tshf1ME0aGB7lYCHOJ9ZCHYA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KyPZB61j2DIN37E5m5IyiZ7AgBbn3REfqyYwOVh3WOMZI81dc4uXCjdIeUeVc6W4puvo3_mB_hoT6pFlVbtWew\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x824046912d13452a6a86fc23b5fe0500dc0d09332a7c22ec9b95ff3379a3f177212394a92a7024f1d96300bdec69eb771043796b7465f7d9b728c06388166cb21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Wsv2eKAUBD8E9JlGCnmLI-tWC66HFnIl2zNUJsHVIX4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"9FKb7v5SsMGuJ_-zSM5tshf1ME0aGB7lYCHOJ9ZCHYA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"l4yrCb0Z2JSTc4MvQrCKqL-HA9Qz5NJgUoGO2Qg15D0\"}"
