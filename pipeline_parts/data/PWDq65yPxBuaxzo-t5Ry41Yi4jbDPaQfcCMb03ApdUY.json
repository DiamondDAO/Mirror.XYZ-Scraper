"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Military training has become the tradition for freshmen. As a high school student, I needed to accept this experience. I was so worried about myself, because I was so afraid of exposing in the strong sun. The first day was hard for me. We stood in the sun, shouting the slogan and moving our bodies. All of us got wet, but we knew we must keep our pace, or we would lag behind. After three days, I learned very fast and became stronger, I would not give up easily. Military training was a valuable experience for me. I made many friends during the ten days. As we were in a team, we got to know each other and cooperated so well. Though it was a little hard for us to do the training, we found our joy and laughed together.\",\"timestamp\":1639129083,\"title\":\"My Time of Military Training\"},\"digest\":\"Un2XsaUB63M9bABmRnrnTKFRUJ08V1LvC0ebuQWyxrY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xBF70b4C0250DEbF3C3Ee1cAb3FAAa2dd011b0bAd\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0PtAu43UzZwYIT7DWOpncKxC3yettnmRZAr1KZ4HTSc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eGrfBaUGp537eTfIN-DwZwjH6OfHITavlgwIjZyxElU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Pc5HKtkETifhnoThPRRfRL-iVBv6a43cXqCfiM5Rd3A9Wtu3DtnyHArhlgT7-8fuKQuwTEiLuC08akrLkuTnwg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x42d5af95f8a38448604d3e7505a5f35862eb5f9c57224c52ed7b4c753f61a1c81004ab8bb69999f4e89556b75a2505b58a611262d42ea8a3761ad9a7238d4ae91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"0PtAu43UzZwYIT7DWOpncKxC3yettnmRZAr1KZ4HTSc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eGrfBaUGp537eTfIN-DwZwjH6OfHITavlgwIjZyxElU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Un2XsaUB63M9bABmRnrnTKFRUJ08V1LvC0ebuQWyxrY\"}"
