"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"singularly enough, the language everywhere prevalent in the politer circles of Judea; having passed from the palace into the camp and college; thence, nobody knew exactly when or how, into the Temple itself, and, for that matter, into precincts of the Temple far beyond the gates and cloisters--precincts of a sanctity intolerable for a Gentile.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, to-morrow,\\\" Messala answered.\\n\\n\\\"Who told you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I heard Ishmael, the new governor in the palace--you call him high priest--tell my father so last night. The news had been more credible, I grant you, coming from an Egyptian, who is of a race that has forgotten what truth is, or even from an Idumaean, whose people never knew what truth was; but, to make quite certain, I saw a centurion from the Tower this morning, and he told me preparations were going on for the reception; that the armorers were furbishing the helmets and shields, and regilding the eagles and globes; and that apartments long unused were being cleansed and aired as if for an addition to the garrison--the body-guard, probably, of the great man.\\\"\\n\\nA perfect idea of the manner in which the answer was given cannot be conveyed, as its fine points continually escape the power behind the pen. The reader's fancy must come to his aid; and for that he must be reminded that reverence as a quality of the Roman mind was fast breaking down, or, rather, it was becoming unfashionable. The old religion had nearly ceased to be a faith; at most it was a mere habit of thought and expression, cherished principally by the priests who found service in the Temple profitable, and the poets who, in the turn of their verses, could not dispense with the familiar deities: there are singers of this age who are similarly given. As philosophy was taking the place of religion, satire was fast substituting reverence; insomuch that in Latin opinion it was to every speech, even to the little diatribes of conversation, as salt to viands, and aroma to wine. The young Messala, educated in Rome, but lately returned, had caught the habit and manner; the scarce perceptible movement of the outer corner of the lower eyelid, the decided curl of the corresponding nostril, and a languid utterance affected as the best vehicle to convey the idea of general indifference, but more particularly because of the opportunities it afforded for certain rhetorical pauses thought to be of prime importance to enable the listener to take the happy conceit or receive the virus of the stinging epigram. Such a stop occurred in the answer just given, at the end of the allusion to the Egyptian and Idumaean. The color in the Jewish lad's cheeks deepened, and he may not have heard the rest of the speech, for he remained silent, looking absently into the depths of the pool.\\n\\n\\\"Our farewell took place in this garden. 'The peace of the Lord go with you!'--your last words. 'The gods keep you!' I said. Do you remember? How many years have passed since then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Five,\\\" answered the Jew, gazing into the water.\\n\\n\\\"Well, you have reason to be thankful to--whom shall I say? The gods? No matter. You have grown handsome; the Greeks would call you beautiful--happy achievement of the years! If Jupiter would stay content with one Ganymede, what a cup-bearer you would make for the emperor! Tell me, my Judah, how the coming of the procurator is of such interest to you.\\\"\\n\\nJudah bent his large eyes upon the questioner; the gaze was grave and thoughtful, and caught the Roman's, and held it while he replied, \\\"Yes, five years. I remember the parting; you went to Rome; I saw you start, and cried, for I love you. The years are gone, and you have come back to me accomplished and princely--I do not jest; and yet--yet--I do wish you were the Messala you went away.\\\"\\n\\nThe fine nostril of the satirist stirred, and he put on a longer drawl as he said, \\\"No, no; not a Ganymede--an oracle, my Judah. A few lessons from my teacher of rhetoric hard by the Forum--I will give you a letter to him when you become wise enough to accept a suggestion which I am reminded to make you--a little practise of the art of mystery, and Delphi will receive you as Apollo himself. At the sound of your solemn voice, the Pythia will come down to you with her crown. Seriously, O my friend, in what am I not the Messala I went away? I once heard the greatest logician in the world. His subject was Disputation. One saying I remember--'Understand your antagonist before you answer him.' Let me understand you.\\\"\\n\\nThe lad reddened under the cynical look to which he was subjected; yet he replied, firmly, \\\"You have availed yourself, I see, of your opportunities; from your teachers you have brought away much knowledge and many graces. You talk with the ease of a master, yet your speech carries a sting. My Messala, when he went away, had no poison in his nature; not for the world would he have hurt the feelings of a friend.\\\"\\n\\nThe Roman smiled as if complimented, and raised his patrician head a toss higher.\\n\\n\\\"O my solemn Judah, we are not at Dodona or Pytho. Drop the oracular, and be plain. Wherein have I hurt you?\\\"\\n\\nThe other drew a long breath, and said, pulling at the cord about his waist, \\\"In the five years, I, too, have learned somewhat. Hillel may not be the equal of the logician you heard, and Simeon and Shammai are, no doubt, inferior to your master hard by the Forum. Their learning goes not out into forbidden paths; those who sit at their feet arise enriched simply with knowledge of God, the law, and Israel; and the effect is love and reverence for everything that pertains to them. Attendance at the Great College, and study of what I heard there, have taught me that Judea is not as she used to be. I know the space that lies between an independent kingdom and the petty province Judea is. I were meaner, viler, than a Samaritan not to resent the degradation of my country. Ishmael is not lawfully high-priest, and he cannot be while the noble Hannas lives; yet he is a Levite; one of the devoted who for thousands of years have acceptably served the Lord God of our faith and worship. His--\\\"\\n\\nMessala broke in upon him with a biting laugh.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, I understand you now. Ishmael, you say, is a usurper, yet to believe an Idumaean sooner than Ishmael is to sting like an adder. By the drunken son of Semele, what it is to be a Jew! All men and things, even heaven and earth, change; but a Jew never. To him there is no backward, no forward; he is what his ancestor was in the beginning. In this sand I draw you a circle--there! Now tell me what more a Jew's life is? Round and round, Abraham here, Isaac and Jacob yonder, God in the middle. And the circle--by the master of all thunders! the circle is too large. I draw it again--\\\" He stopped, put his thumb upon the ground, and swept the fingers about it. \\\"See, the thumb spot is the Temple, the finger-lines Judea. Outside the little space is there nothing of value? The arts! Herod was a builder; therefore he is accursed. Painting, sculpture! to look upon them is sin. Poetry you make fast to your altars. Except in the synagogue, who of you attempts eloquence? In war all you conquer in the six days you lose on the seventh. Such your life and limit; who shall say no if I laugh at you? Satisfied with the worship of such a people, what is your God to our Roman Jove, who lends us his eagles that we may compass the universe with our arms? Hillel, Simeon, Shammai, Abtalion--what are they to the masters who teach that everything is worth knowing that can be known?\\\"\\n\\nThe Jew arose, his face much flushed.\\n\\n\\\"No, no; keep your place, my Judah, keep your place,\\\" Messala cried, extending his hand.\\n\\n\\\"You mock me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Listen a little further. Directly\\\"--the Roman smiled derisively-- \\\"directly Jupiter and his whole family, Greek and Latin, will come to me, as is their habit, and make an end of serious speech. I am mindful of your goodness in walking from the old house of your fathers to welcome me back and renew the love of our childhood-- if we can. 'Go,' said my teacher, in his last lecture--'Go, and, to make your lives great, remember Mars reigns and Eros has found his eyes.' He meant love is nothing, war everything. It is so in Rome. Marriage is the first step to divorce. Virtue is a tradesman's jewel. Cleopatra, dying, bequeathed her arts, and is avenged; she has a successor in every Roman's house. The world is going the same way; so, as to our future, down Eros, up Mars! I am to be a soldier; and you, O my Judah, I pity you; what can you be?\\\"\\n\\nThe Jew moved nearer the pool; Messala's drawl deepened.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I pity you, my fine Judah. From the college to the synagogue; then to the Temple; then--oh, a crowning glory!--the seat in the Sanhedrim. A life without opportunities; the gods help you! But I--\\\"\\n\\nJudah looked at him in time to see the flush of pride that kindled in his haughty face as he went on.\\n\\n\\\"But I--ah, the world is not all conquered. The sea has islands unseen. In the north there are nations yet unvisited. The glory of completing Alexander's march to the Far East remains to some one. See what possibilities lie before a Roman.\\\"\\n\\nNext instant he resumed his drawl.\\n\\n\\\"A campaign into Africa; another after the Scythian; then--a legion! Most careers end there; but not mine. I--by Jupiter! what a conception!--I will give up my legion for a prefecture. Think of life in Rome with money--money, wine, women, games--poets at the banquet, intrigues in the court, dice all the year round. Such a rounding of life may be--a fat prefecture, and it is mine. O my Judah, here is Syria! Judea is rich; Antioch a capital for the gods. I will succeed Cyrenius, and you--shall share my fortune.\\\"\\n\\nThe sophists and rhetoricians who thronged the public resorts of Rome, almost monopolizing the business of teaching her patrician youth, might have approved these sayings of Messala, for they were all in the popular vein; to the young Jew, however, they were new, and unlike the solemn style of discourse and conversation to which he was accustomed. He belonged, moreover, to a race whose laws, modes, and habits of thought forbade satire and humor; very naturally, therefore, he listened to his friend with varying feelings; one moment indignant, then uncertain how to take him. The superior airs assumed had been offensive to him in the beginning; soon they became irritating, and at last an acute smart. Anger lies close by this point in all of us; and that the satirist evoked in another way. To the Jew of the Herodian period patriotism was a savage passion scarcely hidden under his common humor, and so related to his history, religion, and God that it responded instantly to derision of them. Wherefore it is not speaking too strongly to say that Messala's progress down to the last pause was exquisite torture to his hearer; at that point the latter said, with a forced smile,\\n\\n\\\"There are a few, I have heard, who can afford to make a jest of their future; you convince me, O my Messala, that I am not one of them.\\\"\\n\\nThe Roman studied him; then replied, \\\"Why not the truth in a jest as well as a parable? The great Fulvia went fishing the other day; she caught more than all the company besides. They said it was because the barb of her hook was covered with gold.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you were not merely jesting?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"My Judah, I see I did not offer you enough,\\\" the Roman answered, quickly, his eyes sparkling. \\\"When I am prefect, with Judea to enrich me, I--will make you high-priest.\\\"\\n\\nThe Jew turned off angrily.\\n\\n\\\"Do not leave me,\\\" said Messala.\\n\\nThe other stopped irresolute.\\n\\n\\\"Gods, Judah, how hot the sun shines!\\\" cried the patrician, observing his perplexity. \\\"Let us seek a shade.\\\"\\n\\nJudah answered, coldly,\\n\\n\\\"We had better part. I wish I had not come. I sought a friend and find a--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Roman,\\\" said Messala, quickly.\\n\\nThe hands of the Jew clenched, but controlling himself again, he started off. Messala arose, and, taking the mantle from the bench, flung it over his shoulder, and followed after; when he gained his side, he put his hand upon his shoulder and walked with him.\\n\\n\\\"This is the way--my hand thus--we used to walk when we were children. Let us keep it as far as the gate.\\\"\\n\\nApparently Messala was trying to be serious and kind, though he could not rid his countenance of the habitual satirical expression. Judah permitted the familiarity.\\n\\n\\\"You are a boy; I am a man; let me talk like one.\\\"\\n\\nThe complacency of the Roman was superb. Mentor lecturing the young Telemachus could not have been more at ease.\\n\\n\\\"Do you believe in the Parcae? Ah, I forgot, you are a Sadducee: the Essenes are your sensible people; they believe in the sisters. So do I. How everlastingly the three are in the way of our doing what we please! I sit down scheming. I run paths here and there. Perpol! Just when I am reaching to take the world in hand, I hear behind me the grinding of scissors. I look, and there she is, the accursed Atropos! But, my Judah, why did you get mad when I spoke of succeeding old Cyrenius? You thought I meant to enrich myself plundering your Judea. Suppose so; it is what some Roman will do. Why not I?\\\"\\n\\nJudah shortened his step.\\n\\n\\\"There have been strangers in mastery of Judea before the Roman,\\\" he said, with lifted hand. \\\"Where are they, Messala? She has outlived them all. What has been will be again.\\\"\\n\\nMessala put on his drawl.\\n\\n\\\"The Parcae have believers outside the Essenes. Welcome, Judah, welcome to the faith!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, Messala, count me not with them. My faith rests on the rock which was the foundation of the faith of my fathers back further than Abraham; on the covenants of the Lord God of Israel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Too much passion, my Judah. How my master would have been shocked had I been guilty of so much heat in his presence! There were other things I had to tell you, but I fear to now.\\\"\\n\\nWhen they had gone a few yards, the Roman spoke again.\\n\\n\\\"I think you can hear me now, especially as what I have to say concerns yourself. I would serve you, O handsome as Ganymede; I would serve you with real good-will. I love you--all I can. I told you I meant to be a soldier. Why not you also? Why not you step out of the narrow circle which, as I have shown, is all of noble life your laws and customs allow?\\\"\\n\\nJudah made no reply.\\n\\n\\\"Who are the wise men of our day?\\\" Messala continued. \\\"Not they who exhaust their years quarrelling about dead things; about Baals, Joves, and Jehovahs; about philosophies and religions. Give me one great name, O Judah; I care not where you go to find it--to Rome, Egypt, the East, or here in Jerusalem--Pluto take me if it belong not to a man who wrought his fame out of the material furnished him by the present; holding nothing sacred that did not contribute to the end, scorning nothing that did! How was it with Herod? How with the Maccabees? How with the first and second Caesars? Imitate them. Begin now. At hand see--Rome, as ready to help you as she was the Idumaean Antipater.\\\"\\n\\nThe Jewish lad trembled with rage; and, as the garden gate was close by, he quickened his steps, eager to escape.\\n\\n\\\"O Rome, Rome!\\\" he muttered.\\n\\n\\\"Be wise,\\\" continued Messala. \\\"Give up the follies of Moses and the traditions; see the situation as it is. Dare look the Parcae in the face, and they will tell you, Rome is the world. Ask them of Judea, and they will answer, She is what Rome wills.\\\"\\n\\nThey were now at the gate. Judah stopped, and took the hand gently from his shoulder, and confronted Messala, tears trembling in his eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I understand you, because you are a Roman; you cannot understand me--I am an Israelite. You have given me suffering to-day by convincing me that we can never be the friends we have been--never! Here we part. The peace of the God of my fathers abide with you!\\\"\\n\\nMessala offered him his hand; the Jew walked on through the gateway. When he was gone, the Roman was silent awhile; then he, too, passed through, saying to himself, with a toss of the head,\\n\\n\\\"Be it so. Eros is dead, Mars reigns!\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER III\\n\\nFrom the entrance to the Holy City, equivalent to what is now called St. Stephen's Gate, a street extended westwardly, on a line parallel with the northern front of the Tower of Antonia, though a square from that famous castle. Keeping the course as far as the Tyropoeon Valley, which it followed a little way south, it turned and again ran west until a short distance beyond what tradition tells us was the Judgment Gate, from whence it broke abruptly south. The traveller or the student familiar with the sacred locality will recognize the thoroughfare described as part of the Via Dolorosa--with Christians of more interest, though of a melancholy kind, than any street in the world. As the purpose in view does not at present require dealing with the whole street, it will be sufficient to point out a house standing in the angle last mentioned as marking the change of direction south, and which, as an important centre of interest, needs somewhat particular description.\\n\\nThe building fronted north and west, probably four hundred feet each way, and, like most pretentious Eastern structures, was two stories in height, and perfectly quadrangular. The street on the west side was about twelve feet wide, that on the north not more than ten; so that one walking close to the walls, and looking up at them, would have been struck by the rude, unfinished, uninviting, but strong and imposing, appearance they presented; for they were of stone laid in large blocks, undressed--on the outer side, in fact, just as they were taken from the quarry. A critic of this age would have pronounced the house fortelesque in style, except for the windows, with which it was unusually garnished, and the ornate finish of the doorways or gates. The western windows were four in number, the northern only two, all set on the line of the second story in such manner as to overhang the thoroughfares below. The gates were the only breaks of wall externally visible in the first story; and, besides being so thickly riven with iron bolts as to suggest resistance to battering-rams, they were protected by cornices of marble, handsomely executed, and of such bold projection as to assure visitors well informed of the people that the rich man who resided there was a Sadducee in politics and creed.\\n\\nNot long after the young Jew parted from the Roman at the palace up on the Market-place, he stopped before the western gate of the house described, and knocked. The wicket (a door hung in one of the valves of the gate) was opened to admit him. He stepped in hastily, and failed to acknowledge the low salaam of the porter.\\n\\nTo get an idea of the interior arrangement of the structure, as well as to see what more befell the youth, we will follow him.\\n\\nThe passage into which he was admitted appeared not unlike a narrow tunnel with panelled walls and pitted ceiling. There were benches of stone on both sides, stained and polished by long use. Twelve or fifteen steps carried him into a court-yard, oblong north and south, and in every quarter, except the east, bounded by what seemed the fronts of two-story houses; of which the lower floor was divided into lewens, while the upper was terraced and defended by strong balustrading. The servants coming and going along the terraces; the noise of millstones grinding; the garments fluttering from ropes stretched from point to point; the chickens and pigeons in full enjoyment of the place; the goats, cows, donkeys, and horses stabled in the lewens; a massive trough of water, apparently for the common use, declared this court appurtenant to the domestic management of the owner. Eastwardly there was a division wall broken by another passage-way in all respects like the first one.\\n\\nClearing the second passage, the young man entered a second court, spacious, square, and set with shrubbery and vines, kept fresh and beautiful by water from a basin erected near a porch on the north side. The lewens here were high, airy, and shaded by curtains striped alternate white and red. The arches of the lewens rested on clustered columns. A flight of steps on the south ascended to the terraces of the upper story, over which great awnings were stretched as a defence against the sun. Another stairway reached from the terraces to the roof, the edge of which, all around the square, was defined by a sculptured cornice, and a parapet of burned-clay tiling, sexangular and bright red. In this quarter, moreover, there was everywhere observable a scrupulous neatness, which, allowing no dust in the angles, not even a yellow leaf upon a shrub, contributed quite as much as anything else to the delightful general effect; insomuch that a visitor, breathing the sweet air, knew, in advance of introduction, the refinement of the family he was about calling upon.\\n\\nA few steps within the second court, the lad turned to the right, and, choosing a walk through the shrubbery, part of which was in flower, passed to the stairway, and ascended to the terrace--a broad pavement of white and brown flags closely laid, and much worn. Making way under the awning to a doorway on the north side, he entered an apartment which the dropping of the screen behind him returned to darkness. Nevertheless, he proceeded, moving over a tiled floor to a divan, upon which he flung himself, face downwards, and lay at rest, his forehead upon his crossed arms.\\n\\nAbout nightfall a woman came to the door and called; he answered, and she went in.\\n\\n\\\"Supper is over, and it is night. Is not my son hungry?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" he replied.\\n\\n\\\"Are you sick?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am sleepy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your mother has asked for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Where is she?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In the summer-house on the roof.\\\"\\n\\nHe stirred himself, and sat up.\\n\\n\\\"Very well. Bring me something to eat.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What do you want?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What you please, Amrah. I am not sick, but indifferent. Life does not seem as pleasant as it did this morning. A new ailment, O my Amrah; and you who know me so well, who never failed me, may think of the things now that answer for food and medicine. Bring me what you choose.\\\"\\n\\nAmrah's questions, and the voice in which she put them--low, sympathetic, and solicitous--were significant of an endeared relation between the two. She laid her hand upon his forehead; then, as satisfied, went out, saying, \\\"I will see.\\\"\\n\\nAfter a while she returned, bearing on a wooden platter a bowl of milk, some thin cakes of white bread broken, a delicate paste of brayed wheat, a bird broiled, and honey and salt. On one end of the platter there was a silver goblet full of wine, on the other a brazen hand-lamp lighted.\\n\\nThe room was then revealed: its walls smoothly plastered; the ceiling broken by great oaken rafters, brown with rain stains and time; the floor of small diamond-shaped white and blue tiles, very firm and enduring; a few stools with legs carved in imitation of the legs of lions; a divan raised a little above the floor, trimmed with blue cloth, and partially covered by an immense striped woollen blanket or shawl--in brief, a Hebrew bedroom.\\n\\nThe same light also gave the woman to view. Drawing a stool to the divan, she placed the platter upon it, then knelt close by ready to serve him. Her face was that of a woman of fifty, dark-skinned, dark-eyed, and at the moment softened by a look of tenderness almost maternal. A white turban covered her head, leaving the lobes of the ear exposed, and in them the sign that settled her condition--an orifice bored by a thick awl. She was a slave, of Egyptian origin, to whom not even the sacred fiftieth year could have brought freedom; nor would she have accepted it, for the boy she was attending was her life. She had nursed him through babyhood, tended him as a child, and could not break the service. To her love he could never be a man.\\n\\nHe spoke but once during the meal.\\n\\n\\\"You remember, O my Amrah,\\\" he said, \\\"the Messala who used to visit me here days at a time.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I remember him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He went to Rome some years ago, and is now back. I called upon him to-day.\\\"\\n\\nA shudder of disgust seized the lad.\\n\\n\\\"I knew something had happened,\\\" she said, deeply interested. \\\"I never liked the Messala. Tell me all.\\\"\\n\\nBut he fell into musing, and to her repeated inquiries only said, \\\"He is much changed, and I shall have nothing more to do with him.\\\"\\n\\nWhen Amrah took the platter away, he also went out, and up from the terrace to the roof.\\n\\nThe reader is presumed to know somewhat of the uses of the house-top in the East. In the matter of customs, climate is a lawgiver everywhere. The Syrian summer day drives the seeker of comfort into the darkened lewen; night, however, calls him forth early, and the shadows deepening over the mountain-sides seem veils dimly covering Circean singers; but they are far off, while the roof is close by, and raised above the level of the shimmering plain enough for the visitation of cool airs, and sufficiently above the trees to allure the stars down closer, down at least into brighter shining. So the roof became a resort--became playground, sleeping-chamber, boudoir, rendezvous for the family, place of music, dance, conversation, reverie, and prayer.\\n\\nThe motive that prompts the decoration, at whatever cost, of interiors in colder climes suggested to the Oriental the embellishment of his house-top. The parapet ordered by Moses became a potter's triumph; above that, later, arose towers, plain and fantastic; still later, kings and princes crowned their roofs with summer-houses of marble and gold. When the Babylonian hung gardens in the air, extravagance could push the idea no further.\\n\\nThe lad whom we are following walked slowly across the house-top to a tower built over the northwest corner of the palace. Had he been a stranger, he might have bestowed a glance upon the structure as he drew nigh it, and seen all the dimness permitted--a darkened mass, low, latticed, pillared, and domed. He entered, passing under a half-raised curtain. The interior was all darkness, except that on four sides there were arched openings like doorways, through which the sky, lighted with stars, was visible. In one of the openings, reclining against a cushion from a divan, he saw the figure of a woman, indistinct even in white floating drapery. At the sound of his steps upon the floor, the fan in her hand stopped, glistening where the starlight struck the jewels with which it was sprinkled, and she sat up, and called his name.\\n\\n\\\"Judah, my son!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is I, mother,\\\" he answered, quickening his approach.\\n\\nGoing to her, he knelt, and she put her arms around him, and with kisses pressed him to her bosom.\\n\\nCHAPTER IV\\n\\nThe mother resumed her easy position against the cushion, while the son took place on the divan, his head in her lap. Both of them, looking out of the opening, could see a stretch of lower house-tops in the vicinity, a bank of blue-blackness over in the west which they knew to be mountains, and the sky, its shadowy depths brilliant with stars. The city was still. Only the winds stirred.\\n\\n\\\"Amrah tells me something has happened to you,\\\" she said, caressing his cheek. \\\"When my Judah was a child, I allowed small things to trouble him, but he is now a man. He must not forget\\\"-- her voice became very soft--\\\"that one day he is to be my hero.\\\"\\n\\nShe spoke in the language almost lost in the land, but which a few--and they were always as rich in blood as in possessions-- cherished in its purity, that they might be more certainly distinguished from Gentile peoples--the language in which the loved Rebekah and Rachel sang to Benjamin.\\n\\nThe words appeared to set him thinking anew; after a while, however, he caught the hand with which she fanned him, and said, \\\"Today, O my mother, I have been made to think of many things that never had place in my mind before. Tell me, first, what am I to be?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Have I not told you? You are to be my hero.\\\"\\n\\nHe could not see her face, yet he knew she was in play. He became more serious.\\n\\n\\\"You are very good, very kind, O my mother. No one will ever love me as you do.\\\"\\n\\nHe kissed the hand over and over again.\\n\\n\\\"I think I understand why you would have me put off the question,\\\" he continued. \\\"Thus far my life has belonged to you. How gentle, how sweet your control has been! I wish it could last forever. But that may not be. It is the Lord's will that I shall one day become owner of myself--a day of separation, and therefore a dreadful day to you. Let us be brave and serious. I will be your hero, but you must put me in the way. You know the law--every son of Israel must have some occupation. I am not exempt, and ask now, shall I tend the herds? or till the soil? or drive the saw? or be a clerk or lawyer? What shall I be? Dear, good mother, help me to an answer.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Gamaliel has been lecturing today,\\\" she said, thoughtfully.\\n\\n\\\"If so, I did not hear him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then you have been walking with Simeon, who, they tell me, inherits the genius of his family.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I have not seen him. I have been up on the Market-place, not to the Temple. I visited the young Messala.\\\"\\n\\nA certain change in his voice attracted the mother's attention. A presentiment quickened the beating of her heart; the fan became motionless again.\\n\\n\\\"The Messala!\\\" she said. \\\"What could he say to so trouble you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He is very much changed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean he has come back a Roman.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Roman!\\\" she continued, half to herself. \\\"To all the world the word means master.
