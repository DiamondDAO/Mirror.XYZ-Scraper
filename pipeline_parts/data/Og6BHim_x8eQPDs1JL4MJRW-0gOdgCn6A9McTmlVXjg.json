Ticket holders began their portal travel towards the faraway world of Elektra. By digging for clues and decrypting hidden messages, travellers have so far unlocked Elektra's Sonic Forcefield, landed on the surface of Elektra, found an ancient letter from a group called The Zeph, and discovered a [Log device with a message on it from Cat & Alpha](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/HaQAd8PInTpf-I7EUzqDh03JVpwJX3oQmZzBpAZcKqo) -- 2 travellers who got swept into a blackhole along the way to Elektra. They are now lost in an undisclosed location somewhere on Elektra's surface. And it seems they've discovered something too - a Capsule of some sort.\\n\\nThe search for Cat & Alpha has begun, but no sign of them just yet. Along the search, travellers have found an ancient letter from a mysterious group called The Zeph...\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f601f6b0-0c44-45f3-9dde-394fd87b13ed.png?height=1492&width=1614)\\n\\n***The search for Cat & Alpha continues, along with more clues as to who and where The Zeph might be. Today, travellers come upon their most startling discovery yet...*** \\n\\n## Jump into the interactive Elektra Game! \\n\\n*Elektra* is an interactive web3 game with music at its core. Each level acts like an escape game within Elektra's closed-access Discord. As participants move through the levels, they'll learn how it will take music to save the world of Elektra from extinction. \\n\\nIf you've got an [Elektra Portal Ticket](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/mkb-m9GWUCLByETAvCigJ0JIpz4XH8bwNDBtUJBPeFc) and at least 100 $ELEKTRA, [jump through the Portal here](https://elektra.camp/#/)!\\n\\n## Elektra Project Roadmap\\nThe following is a breakdown of Elektra's project roadmap.
