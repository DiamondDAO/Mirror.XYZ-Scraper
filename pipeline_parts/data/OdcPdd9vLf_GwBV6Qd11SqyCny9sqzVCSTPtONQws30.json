"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1945\\n\\nIt was called 'TEAMHOUGH' - an intelligence unit with special passes from Allied Supreme HQ. \\n\\nThe team’s leader surveyed Latin America for oil companies, and included specialists, from the Military Intelligence Training Center in Ft. Ritchie, Maryland, trained in PsyOps.\\n\\nOne operative was an affable German who ran a deli in NYC before the War. He was a formidable interrogator known to disappear, for days at a time on orders, and reappear like a ghost at prearranged times and places. In one critical interrogation, the subject, after several hours, gave up one word - \\\"Saalfield\\\".\\n\\nSaalfield was a city with a treasure that would tip the global balance of power. The German High Command moved its treasure to a location safe from the destruction leveled at Berlin in 1945.\\n\\nIt was data: precise drawings, surveys and measurements of Eastern Europe, and the territory of a rising rival, the USSR. After the interrogation, 'TEAMHOUGH' sent a message to Allied command.\\n\\n\\\"Truckloads of documents, much of it irreplaceable, of extreme value”\\n\\n200 tons of data, maps, and precision tech had to be moved. The war was ending soon. By April 1945, the Germans surrendered and the data was still in what would become Soviet territory. The Red Army arrived on July 2. The last of the data was recovered on July 1.\\n\\n100,000 maps covering all of Europe, Asiatic Russia, North Africa, the Middle East and more. 95 percent of the data was new to the U.S. military. The data formed a map of the post-war order.\\n\\nWith this data, years later, the U.S could target the heart of the USSR. \\n\\nThat new weapon of the Cold War, the ICBM, could be accurately targeted - at Moscow. A global war was ending, the last of the 19th Century melted away, the 21st just decades away. \\n\\nA new war, the Cold War, was coming.\\n\\n2912\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. sat quietly in the conference room. \\n\\nHolographs of maps and data streams floated above and around the room. The faint blue tint of the sunset came through the window. He did not slouch.\\n\\nThe Director walked in. Jacob got up from his chair.\\n\\n”Thank you for coming in, Jacob, please have a seat. Coffee?”\\n\\n”No thank you, Director. I’ve already had some.”\\n\\n”Been a long day. Let’s get to it. We’ve reviewed the peripheral.”\\n\\nThe Director poured herself a coffee and walked over to the table and gestured at it. It lit up and the room’s holos and maps reconfigured.\\n\\n“After your talks with the Doctor, we were able to reach out to other assets, and the peripheral you obtained took us another step further. I want to go over this with you. We have other operatives in the field with their assignments. We’re here to discuss yours.”\\n\\n”Yes, Director. I’m ready.”\\n\\nThe Director smiled.\\n\\n”Jacob, when you landed on my doorstep, you were no ordinary recruit. Your father is someone who knew a lot of people. He and I, we served together in the Long War. But that’s not why you’re here. We were curious about what became of Dr. John Cadmus, and his work. That is.”\\n\\n”I understand. You mean ‘Uncle AL’.”\\n\\n”Yes. ‘AL’, short for ‘Automated Algorithmic Learning Program, in his case, ‘Series H’. Alep-H. Or “AL” as he calls himself. You didn’t know that did you?”\\n\\nJacob paused. He grew up learning to be careful with secrets.\\n\\n“No Madame Director, I heard and saw things growing up, but all I knew is that since Dad died, Uncle AL took care of me, since I was 10.”\\n\\n“Jacob. AL’s “father”, Dr. Cadmus, wasn’t alone in his objections to the Treaty of Mars leading to the “Great Upload” but he made the mistake of letting the Triumvirate know. We have been more careful.”\\n\\nThe war Jacob ran from, that his family fought and died for, had followed him to Mars. He realized his training was for what he feared most.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ka_CiCpzmQ_-0KUYF61_Q.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DbHUtePnjVioJ-sDtbx7s.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633896162,\"title\":\"1961: 5.8 Maps Of The Next World, 2912\"},\"digest\":\"HXzzAUSkVMlGzIgzAOS6lUUXICQwm7YvVOH6tI8xpAY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kaPkaGPG5SDR2Nr4PUDC6nykGAqGdx4RuR7Z-6DceVSdqavEuFkzQ6Ggzmbt0UHTUW9RN9bNocrwBW7MMYYYBg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6wFAWmIhdU4DrmmK-zu3vB4ylgYH5rOWE776RnzdyIE\"}"
