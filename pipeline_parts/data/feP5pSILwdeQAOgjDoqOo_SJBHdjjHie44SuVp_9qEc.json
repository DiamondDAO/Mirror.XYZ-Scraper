Major Upgrades of Dataverse: a brand new plug-in**\\n\\n* Social Graph data is owned by users. In addition to favorites, users can also follow creators and owners of NFT directly through the plug-in without visiting other social platforms. User can also jump directly to the Dataverse space of a specific address through the plug-in;\\n* Support KnowOrigin and Makersplace, with which, 9 NFT platforms have been compatible.\\n* Considerably optimize the login experience of the plug-in and users do not need to re-authenticate their own identity\\n* Add shortcut functions.

Loop: Your Web3 Data Stream**\\n\\nLoop is a content aggregator for tracking the latest events in the open web, including NFTs, Mirrors articles, or POAP badges. It allows users to personalize their activity feed and filter out spam via community discovery. Like Twitter, Loop can automatically integrate the on-chain and off-chain dynamics of multiple wallets into a real-time information stream and present it in user personal spaces. With LOOP, users can follow other people‚Äôs wallet addresses, in which case, they can track their friends, KOLs, whales, and watch their on-chain and off-chain dynamics, and even the NFT transactions of CryptoPunks holders; at the same time, users can also view many high-quality articles on Mirror.\\n\\nWe will invite many artists to create favorites, in which case, you may continue to follow the dynamics of DAO Punk Loot holders.\\n\\n**END**\\n\\n‚ÄúEveryone is petty, yet everyone owns one universe.‚Äù ‚Äî ‚Äî Owen\\n\\n## About Dataverse\\n\\nThe Dataverse is developed by **Ownership Labs**, which is the user-centred private space for sorting and displaying your interests in one place.
