The reason I made the tokens is to power a DAO for people to have access to a resource in creating a DAO from scratch.\\n\\nThere is another DAO I am a part of that has been without a token. There wasn’t really a need for it. Governance of the DAO is handled perfectly using moloch as implemented by [DAOhaus](https://daohaus.club/). Where the need for a token really presented itself, is in encouraging user engagement in the DAO. Practising token creation on an L2 sidechain (aka inexpensive) was a task I took on for the [DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xd8837c5bf792443edec94576e23450166dfd3ae8/proposals)\\n\\nThe more time I have spent working on and learning about DAO’s, I have encountered the same problem repeatedly. Teaching the fundamentals of DAO’s seems to be a front and centre issue for a lot of DAO start-ups. Resources have been thin and compiling information has been a task most have to deal with. The DAOists is a DAO, mostly located on Discord and airtable right now, that has taken this problem head on by collecting as much information as possible through it’s [resource list airbase](https://airtable.com/shrKgyx43sFvQE5lp/tblNQOw5j40sTBtPg), including a separate airbase for [DAO tools](https://airtable.com/shrrXaF1CvPdp94Y8/tblsy93cTWAhYiXOQ) and one for [articles](https://airtable.com/shrAyCIteuG6kB1H3) about the space.\\n\\nAs a disclaimer, a lot of what I do here, such as writing this article and the videos created, will be shared with DAOhaus to add to their own content if they choose. A side goal of my developing this DAO, is to put it in some work in aide of developing and supporting the documentaion of moloch DAOs as it is implemented through DAOhaus. It is also in aide of The DAOists in their mission of educating and converting the world into “DAOism.”\\n\\n[https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp](https://discord.gg/dEJFDKHvCp)\\n\\nDAOhaus is playing a game. Every week, DAOhaus does their weekly “Haus Party” chat on their discord server. During this event there are [POAP](https://poap.xyz/)s distributed to attendees. If you are the owner of the POAP you are then able to enter the “War Games.” This game is a DAO and is about as open ended as possible. The direction of the game is decided by making proposals in the DAO, and holding votes. Basically, doing the thing that DAOs do. It truly is a wonderful way to teach about DAO’s and how to use a moloch DAO. So I’m stealing their idea.\\n\\n## German Art and Slaying Demons\\n\\n![Slaying Moloch requires Co-Ordination](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2dry6Az1t194mgdoARFgE.png?height=719&width=721)\\n\\nIn [Scott Alexander’s](https://slatestarcodex.com/author/admin/) essay [Meditaions on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/) we learn of a powerful demon Moloch that represents a system humankind hates but lack the tools to co-ordinate and make the changes everyone knows needs to be made.\\n\\n> There’s [a passage](http://principiadiscordia.com/book/45.php) in the *Principia Discordia* where Malaclypse complains to the Goddess about the evils of human society. “Everyone is hurting each other, the planet is rampant with injustices, whole societies plunder groups of their own people, mothers imprison sons, children perish while brothers war.”\\n>\\n> The Goddess answers: “What is the matter with that, if it’s what you want to do?”\\n>\\n> Malaclypse: “But nobody wants it! Everybody hates it!”\\n>\\n> Goddess: “Oh. Well, then stop.”\\n>\\n> The implicit question is – if everyone hates the current system, who perpetuates it? And Ginsberg answers: “Moloch”.\\n\\nThe Moloch DAO framework seems to have been built around the ideas introduced in Alexander’s analysis of Ginsberg’s poem [Howl](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49303/howl). Aiming to create a set of tools humans can use, to address the issues of co-ordination failure and truly take the world into a new direction and slaying the moloch.\\n\\nDAOhaus brings a whole new level to the story of co-ordination. What they have done, is take the Moloch code and created a user interface in which anybody with a little knowledge of how to navigate [Web3](https://web3.foundation/), can create and/or be a part of a DAO.\\n\\n> [DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/) was [born at ETHBerlin 2019](https://medium.com/odyssy/daohaus-bauhaus-b855cd9db19e), a hackathon project aiming to make it easier (or possible at all) to interact with the [Moloch DAO smart contracts](https://github.com/MolochVentures/moloch/blob/master/v1_contracts/README.md) in a human-readable way. After a days-long, Club Mate induced frenzy, the very first build of DAOhaus was born! Thus beginning the almost two year journey focused on bringing more open tools for financial coordination to the Ethereum ecosystem.\\n\\n[https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a](https://medium.com/daohaus-club/haus-launch-bd781bbbf13a)\\n\\nThe story that I’ve heard, (I was looking everywhere for where I’ve heard, so I may well be taking some artistic liberty here) is something about the original hack group in Berlin rocking out to a band called Bauhaus during EthBerlin 2019. Which, if true, is a very serendipitous event.\\n\\nIf we look a little deeper, into the history of the German bauhaus art scene, we learn it is built around a philosophy of creating functional art using multidisciplinary skillsets collaborating in new and innovative ways. This began in actual buildings in which the interiors were fitted with all the tools students required to work and collaborate together. In a digital Web3 format, DAOhaus is doing the same thing. Providing a haus of tools for people to collaborate and slay moloch.\\n\\n> The Bauhaus was founded in 1919 in the city of Weimar by German architect Walter Gropius (1883–1969). Its core objective was a radical concept: to reimagine the material world to reflect the unity of all the arts. Gropius explained this vision for a union of art and design in the Proclamation of the Bauhaus (1919), which described a utopian craft guild combining architecture, sculpture, and painting into a single creative expression. Gropius developed a craft-based curriculum that would turn out artisans and designers capable of creating useful and beautiful objects appropriate to this new system of living.\\n\\n[https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm](https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bauh/hd_bauh.htm)\\n\\nThe idea is, I am going to create a new DAO. As you may have already guessed, it will be called Boiler DAO. In this case, I put the cart before the horse. I made the token, named after my social media alias, then decided instead of it just taking up space, I might as well use it. The token is not swappable for anything on any exchange. It is a “pure” social token. It may not always be that way.\\n\\nThe goal of this DAO will be to tell a story. In both the literal sense and the figurative sense. I will begin this DAO and start some of the basic fundamentals. From there, I will let it grow or fade on it’s own.  Creativity in decentralized story telling, at the same time learning about DAO’s, provides a new tool to aide startups who would like to spend their time focusing on the product or service they intend to offer, instead of teaching fundementals of DAOs.\\n\\n## How the Story Will be Told\\n\\nHonestly, I don’t know. If I did, then I wouldn’t be honest in my intentions to have a decentralized project. I will start it. I will create videos. These videos will aide anybody who wants to view them in their own journey of creating or participating in a DAO. This will be a large part of the educational aspect of this DAO.\\n\\nI will do the basics and then the DAO will decide everything else through proposals, this article being the first part of the process. Obviously I’m not going to make a video of myself typing an article but the rest of it I will. I will create the DAO on xDai. I will then create a [safe minion](https://daohaus.club/docs/users/minion/), which will create a [gnosis safe](https://gnosis-safe.io/), controlled by the DAO. I will deposit 9 Million BOILD tokens into the DAO and from that point forward those tokens will be controlled by the DAO.\\n\\nI will then create a Discord server and a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjlcjNvqwUxRIma1_d05uYA) channel. Again, this will be as bare bones as possible but it is an opportunity to teach how to do this, as it is a pretty vital part of the *process for this DAO.* I say this because there are many ways to form a DAO and I don’t want anybody to come out of this thinking, ok, If I do every step I see here, I will have a DAO. This may very well be true, but you may not have the DAO you want. The point of this exercise, is to show a particular set of tools that I happened to learn about. All I want you to recognize is that they are tools, and you can use many different tools in different combinations to form your own DAO. If you click the link I provided above to The DAOists tools airtable you will get a good overview of some of the other tools available to you.\\n\\nThere certainly are other forms of social media at our disposal I could set up as well but it will be up to the DAO to decide how that goes. The one thing I will do, beyond the basics, is set up the collab.land bot on the discord. This will allow for distribution of the remaining tokens to people interested in the DAO. I will distribute 1000 tokens, through the bot to anybody that requests them, up until the point that the DAO decides to change that. Being the creator of the discord, I will be the mod there, until there are a few members of the DAO, then the DAO will decide. 500,000 tokens will be deposited into the collab.land bot for distribution purposes.\\n\\nThe remaining tokens I reserve to keep, as the creator of the token. It will be mostly used during the making of the tutorial videos but maybe one day I will use them to buy a lambo.\\n\\n![Who Knows?](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RQlRj7T29gFxs02IdeBZl.gif?height=187&width=198)\\n\\nThe price for entry into the DAO will be: one share per one $BOILD token. The token will also be used as the currency to perform actions within the DAO (so if you do propose membership, keep that in mind you will still need some later. You will also need a little wxdai and xdai in your wallet. You can wrap your xdai easily at [WrapEth.com]().  After everything is set up, with the basics, I will then make the first proposal for the beginning of the literal story and gamification of The Boiler DAO.\\n\\n## Gamification of Boiler DAO\\n\\nThe idea will be a fictional tale with distributed authorship and each part of the story told after being democratically decided upon by the DAO. A proposal can be a sentence, paragraph, chapter, word, haiku, an edit, a photo…. who knows. Perhaps to entries for the next part of the story are so good it creates a fork in the story, which may even cause a fork in the DAO itself, which would also be super interesting. The point being, the DAO will decide and grow (or fail) as it’s own organism set loose upon the Web3 space.\\n\\nMy original thought was that, after everything was set up, I would make a proposal for the first line or paragraph and *we* would take it from there. As I was working on this document and doing a few other tasks I was listening in on a Discord call for the Moloch DAO discord server.\\n\\n[https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth](https://discord.gg/5HeK8Dwfth)\\n\\nFor the most part I was just enjoying the talk, I believe I could listen to [Travis Wyche](https://medium.com/@traviswyche) talk for hours. Eventually I could no longer concentrate on what I was doing and had to focus on the conversation until it actually lead to a point where I could jump in. It was interesting because the *first* act of collaboration for this “autonomous” organization still required some human to human collaboration. (He also suggested xdai as opposed to the “[broken](https://cryptobriefing.com/polygon-swerves-850-million-hack-ethereum-bridge/)” [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as another successful virtual yet personal collaboration).\\n\\nThe point of Travis’ constructive questioning of decentralized story telling was the very valid concern that character development and plot is essentially the result of an authors imagination which leads to a narrative being told and there may be a fundamental problem in the story which could lead to a directionless jumble of words. That could also be interesting, but perhaps unreadable.\\n\\nSo now I have changed my mind about how to start this. Instead of starting the story, I will just leave a blank page. Perhaps the DAO will decide to spend time on character and plot development first and then “elect” writers to move the story forward. I really don’t know and I don’t want to know either. This \\\"game” could turn into a publishing powerhouse with multiple ongoing narratives, or it might produce a haiku and dissolve. Time will tell and democracy will decide.\\n\\nThere are many tools available to us in the Web3 space. This game/story/educational DAO will attempt to use as many tools as it can in order to be successful. It is meant as a seed and will grow if tended to. Hopefully it will take advantage of as many web3 tools as we can. We will start with youtube and hopefully transition that to a Web3 service WHEN one become available. We can use this DAO to experiment with new ideas and new tools, find out what works what doesn’t and offer suggestions to create things that don’t even exist yet.\\n\\n## Fictionalized Micro Economy\\n\\nAs this story unfolds, there will be opportunities within the DAO to earn tokens. Again, this will be up to the DAO how this is handled but there are many tasks that will need to be completed in order to make this successful. For example, there may not be a way for the DAO, after a proposal has passed for the next paragraph, to automate the text adding the text to the publishing service. A member of the DAO may be hired to perform that task and be rewarded by tips or even through a constant trickle of tokens, controlled by the DAO (yes this is possible). The direction is to be decided as we weave our way through [The Rise of The Micro-Economies](https://coopahtroopa.mirror.xyz/gWY6Kfebs9wHdfoZZswfiLTBVzfKiyFaIwNf2q8JpgI)\\n\\nThe DAO may even decide that there is a particular NFT on Rarible that would be an excellent part of the story. There are many different ways for the DAO to go about acquiring one and the fun part will be for the DAO to figure out which tools it will need to carry out the tasks.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI think I have explained enough as far as the creation of this DAO goes. It is nearly impossible to start a DAO without the original creator or creators influence. I intend to minimize that as much as possible for the launch and then let it be an exercise in creative use of existing and future Web3 technologies. Let’s do it as an exercise in democracy in a micro-economy with no borders. Let’s use it as a foundational educational tool for an emerging technology that is more and more becoming the daily life of humans.\\n\\nLet’s make a cool story.\\n\\n![When we're done you'll be buff](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SVMy6xuWDsvttRsHZCVxa.JPG?height=1200&width=1190)\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow](https://youtu.be/TNQ0fK-kqow)\\n\\nI would have liked to have done a split here with some of the people mentioned in this article.
