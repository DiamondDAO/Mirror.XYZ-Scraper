"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with his\\n\\nfoot, and went home through the darkness; but he went not alone, as he\\n\\nthought,- the little elf accompanied him. He sat in a dry rolled-up\\n\\nlinden-leaf, which had fallen from the tree on to the wicked man's\\n\\nhead, as he was digging the grave. The hat was on the head now,\\n\\nwhich made it very dark, and the little elf shuddered with fright\\n\\nand indignation at the wicked deed.\\n\\n```\\nIt was the dawn of morning before the wicked man reached home;\\n```\\n\\nhe took off his hat, and went into his sister's room. There lay the\\n\\nbeautiful, blooming girl, dreaming of him whom she loved so, and who\\n\\nwas now, she supposed, travelling far away over mountain and sea.\\n\\nHer wicked brother stopped over her, and laughed hideously, as\\n\\nfiends only can laugh. The dry leaf fell out of his hair upon the\\n\\ncounterpane; but he did not notice it, and went to get a little\\n\\nsleep during the early morning hours. But the elf slipped out of the\\n\\nwithered leaf, placed himself by the ear of the sleeping girl, and\\n\\ntold her, as in a dream, of the horrid murder; described the place\\n\\nwhere her brother had slain her lover, and buried his body; and told\\n\\nher of the linden-tree, in full blossom, that stood close by.\\n\\n```\\n\\\"That you may not think this is only a dream that I have told\\n```\\n\\nyou,\\\" he said, \\\"you will find on your bed a withered leaf.\\\"\\n\\n```\\nThen she awoke, and found it there. Oh, what bitter tears she\\n```\\n\\nshed! and she could not open her heart to any one for relief.\\n\\n```\\nThe window stood open the whole day, and the little elf could\\n```\\n\\neasily have reached the roses, or any of the flowers; but he could not\\n\\nfind it in his heart to leave one so afflicted. In the window stood\\n\\na bush bearing monthly roses. He seated himself in one of the flowers,\\n\\nand gazed on the poor girl. Her brother often came into the room,\\n\\nand would be quite cheerful, in spite of his base conduct; so she dare\\n\\nnot say a word to him of her heart's grief.\\n\\n```\\nAs soon as night came on, she slipped out of the house, and went\\n```\\n\\ninto the wood, to the spot where the linden-tree stood; and after\\n\\nremoving the leaves from the earth, she turned it up, and there\\n\\nfound him who had been murdered. Oh, how she wept and prayed that\\n\\nshe also might die! Gladly would she have taken the body home with\\n\\nher; but that was impossible; so she took up the poor head with the\\n\\nclosed eyes, kissed the cold lips, and shook the mould out of the\\n\\nbeautiful hair.\",\"timestamp\":1636531391,\"title\":\"Then he scattered the dry leaves over the light earth with hisfoot\"},\"digest\":\"o6ItN5I0OnsOWPEg32EQqtW9G_lGEjqnuk50w2RqAE0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8918151a07B96D518Ab70C61e4091FfA62e25A17\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EcHgbx4PaDhp4uYTYjwBItuEjPby2kkAOjgWITpy0hQU0n9kTIe7x7JSuuL7_VMMfJeI1t0TlNnozjsJub-GxA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1d0070b3d71460522c9fef6c88b79f7074cfae0e0c715cda41e6999a0d02a29b705fd62c19372523f43bbe911bd30f899c0a56dfaaf5bbac2c28b1ba4e1878171c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"tGXb0_gY0JSZktdQSvSXTNC67TyW8O-2ngQKjv-6Qak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wEqfIoFrn-f-Y_64FC3M1RZzCdocCF2jVCEwFVWy0tY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"o6ItN5I0OnsOWPEg32EQqtW9G_lGEjqnuk50w2RqAE0\"}"
