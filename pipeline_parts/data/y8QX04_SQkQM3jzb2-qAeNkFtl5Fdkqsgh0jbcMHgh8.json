"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On the African savannah, there is a strange plant, whose name is pointed hair grass. Maocao, known as the \\\"king of grassland\\\", is one of the highest and most lush Maocao in Africa. However, unexpectedly, the initial growth process of C. acuminata is extremely slow, and there is no king's weather at all. When spring comes, other plants begin to grow wildly, and the pointed grass seems to have never felt the call of the spring breeze at all, and it keeps around an inch all the time, just like the abandoned wretch, which looks lonely and poor. Seeing that spring is coming to an end, the pointed grass still slowly absorbs sunshine and rain, like a child who can hardly see any growth and is lower than many weeds on the grassland. Just when people were extremely disappointed with the sharp grass, the situation suddenly reversed. Half a year later, when a heavy rain hit, the pointed hairy grass sprang up as if it had been enchanted. Every day, it grew up at an alarming rate of one and a half feet. In less than a week, it grew to 1.67 meters, and some even reached 2 meters high. Looking around, rows and rows of pointed grass are like green high walls, becoming a beautiful landscape on the African grassland. At first, people have been wondering why the low Maojian grass can suddenly become the \\\"king of grass\\\". Later, through research, botanists found that it wasn't without growth before, because it didn't grow stems on the ground, but roots on the ground. For half a year, the roots of Carex acuminata continuously expanded to the surrounding and underground, and the deepest place actually reached more than 20 meters. Its roots firmly locked the water and nutrients in the soil. When the accumulated energy meets the needs of growth, the pointed hair grass will be out of control, and in just a few days, it will grow as tall as a human being. It's not uncommon to look down and look up. There is also an interesting plant growing in Sichuan. Its name is Phyllostachys pubescens. This kind of bamboo is very tall. Its pole is more than 20 meters high and its diameter is more than 20 centimeters. However, in the first five years, the growth of Phyllostachys pubescens was very slow, so it was called \\\"dwarf\\\" in the forest. However, when the rainy season comes in the sixth year, it rushes upward at a speed of six feet every day. In about half a month, the bamboo will become the height champion in the forest, and the wind will not blow down. What's more peculiar is that when Phyllostachys pubescens is in the growing period, the surrounding plants have to make way for it, and other plants can not absorb nutrients until it grows up to be an adult. Like Maocao, Phyllostachys pubescens developed its roots first, then its stems, and finally, they all became the best of their kind. Originally, whether plants or people want to get ahead, they must learn to endure, learn to work hard, and make themselves an invincible sword before the opportunity comes. The so-called success comes naturally. When your efforts reach a certain level, you will make a big splash and push yourself to the peak of success with lightning speed. \\n \",\"timestamp\":1642491614,\"title\":\"Lower your head to raise your head.\"},\"digest\":\"AvoiqcY3rWTKPc8ntdiFM0xAO8Cd5SlCNM6BYyaF1jY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3aC600529478aD2738Cbe3602C49Da01541B1656\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sm09ev4QzUHLnghuALqDwm6MRsMh2MGM4BSXSFoZ9R4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"54jMv7x7mcaYd1OvFc4bpmebz1jdyeaDa64qkc9JLqw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"MvWkDl8EWsakS1fVJC8vbBe5SI2wo4KQdMfzN6XvpPYz769JR7mIR37AYoLxnt6e4lFPLYY0x-NBa5XKJK3vpg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x0656c099499149b1b00e52a9c6c1b95ba1e2f21b6c4afd190ede246efdb1bc56515d7b252832a411fef61f7e0d0b84a859de761e6400bed2c7643bca364584fd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"sm09ev4QzUHLnghuALqDwm6MRsMh2MGM4BSXSFoZ9R4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"54jMv7x7mcaYd1OvFc4bpmebz1jdyeaDa64qkc9JLqw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"AvoiqcY3rWTKPc8ntdiFM0xAO8Cd5SlCNM6BYyaF1jY\"}"
