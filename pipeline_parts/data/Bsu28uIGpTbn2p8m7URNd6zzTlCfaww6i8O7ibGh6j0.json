"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**Hello everyone!**\\n\\nChoosing which NFT project is seriously a daunting task and I truly want to help you with that process. For every 1 really good project, there are probably 100 not so good ones. \\n\\nFor starters, if you are looking to make quick money in the NFT space, it isn’t for you. You will eventually get burned. Like most things, enter the space having patience and an open-mind. That’s a good place to start. \\n\\nI’d like to provide an example of what a genuine project looks like— *The World of Women (WoW).* Use this as a framework when analysing projects you are thinking of buying. And keep it simple — if a project offers zero value, then don’t buy it, even if the price is moving up quickly. That ride will eventually come to and end, usually quickly.\\n\\nI have outlined some key factors which make the World of Women a genuine and desirable project. One that is investable and likely to be here for years to come. Have a look: \\n\\n*Supporting upcoming artists in the NFT space by buying their 1/1 art pieces.* World of Women is passionate about supporting artists’ gain spotlight attention within the space. In November 2021, the WoW team acquired 13 art pieces from emerging artists. This is something WoW is truly passionate about. They truly have a selfless team who want to see other artists be successful. The WoW team is about “we”, and not “I”. \\n\\n*Bringing inclusivity and representation in the NFT space.* As of now, the NFT and crypto space is predominantly driven by men. The World of Women is one of the first projects that is led by a Woman. They are passionate about inspiring other women artists and business leaders to take the leap into the digital space and begin their own journey. The more women and minorities that come into the space, the more others will follow. \\n\\n*Supporting equal opportunity amongst women and minorities.* For example, an organization called, she’s the first, is a fund the WoW family is passionate about as it focuses on finding solutions which educate and empower girls across 26 countries— providing them with the opportunity to strive for their dreams. Other organizations they support are Too Young To Wed and Strang Cintia.\\n\\n*Educating people on crypto and NFTs.* Education is an important subject matter to the community. WoW has created their own dedicated education hub. The only way the crypto/nft space is able to grow is by educating people on crypto and NFTs. It is a great place to start learning if you are new to the space.

In simple terms, an NFT is a digital asset that represents items like art, music, and real estate. When we think about what an NFT represents for the World of Women, think about buying a share of equity in a brand or business. The NFT represents a portion of the equity you own in their brand (the same way you would buy a share of a company, like Apple, for example). As the World of Women brand continues to grow, there is a chance the value of their NFTs will also go up in value. Also, if your WoW NFT generates any profit from commercial use, for example, the owner of the NFT will receive 50% of the profits. Your NFT can generate ETH, how cool is that.** \\n **\\n\\nThe key take-away here is to look for value. If you don’t see value, then don’t buy it— plain and simple. I hope this framework helped.
