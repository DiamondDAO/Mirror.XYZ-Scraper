"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1936 Berlin\\n\\nIn the Ancient Aegean, games of sport, strength and skill were held between city states. The Olympics. In the Modern Age, the same games were held between nation states - games within games.\\n\\nThe Germans used them in 1936. In 1939, WW II erupted, and then a secret war emerged in 1946 - the Cold War - U.S. versus USSR.\\n\\nThere were proxy wars through smaller nations, the Space Race and the race for gold medals. Stalin declined in 1948 in favor of creating teams for 1952 which resulted in 71 medals, 22 gold. The strategy led to dominance of the 1956 games: USSR 98 to U.S. 74.\\n\\nThere were also the boycotts and protests by proxy. The East Germans refused in 1952 when the \\\"Committee\\\" wanted a unified German team, and invested to build world-class teams.\\n\\n2 weeks before the 1956 games, Soviet tanks rolled into Hungary, the local government deposed and 2,000 protestors killed. During the water polo match between the Hungarians and Russians, fights broke out and blood was drawn. The Hungarians made it to gold.\\n\\nAt the 1972 games, the Soviet basketball team won gold after a mixup among referrees. The Americans refused silver. In 1976, the Republic of China (Taiwan)'s team boycotted due to host Canada's refusal to acknowledge their sovereignty.\\n\\nThe Soviets had invaded Afghanistan and the U.S. and other nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow games hosted by the USSR, opting to create a \\\"Liberty Games\\\" with 29 nations attending. In retaliation, the USSR boycotted the 1984 L.A. Games, and held the \\\"Friendship Games\\\" with 14 Soviet Bloc nations.\\n\\nThe Cold War faded. The Olympic Games remained. The Games within the games will change with the rise of new powers.\\n\\n**2913 Earth - The Necklace, The Pearl**\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. soaked in the energy of the afterparty in 'The Pearl', a gathering and event space, a node within the 'Verse of the System. \\n\\nHe was attending as a dignitary of a Martian Trade Cooperative. As far as everyone was concerned he was another \\\"VIP\\\" pampered by the amenities of his hosts.\\n\\nThe Director sent Jacob to meet with Fernanda Marie-Therese Roque. Jacob's real assignment was to get close to the Praetor of the Triumvirate, Alea, one of the A.I.s who ruled over the System.\\n\\nShe was created was to prosecute the Long War. Instead, she banded with all surviving A.I.s to make peace, and take over.\\n\\n\\\"If you get close to Alea, what do you expect, prison or death?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I expect information.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know better than to ask. All you want from me is access to her.”\\n\\n\\\"That's right, Lady Fernanda. How to reach her, nothing else.\\\"\\n\\nFernanda knew better than to ask 'why' or 'what for', that was not her game, winning moves meant staying alive and in business.\\n\\n\\\"Lady Fernanda\\\" was a long way away from her pre-war life running off-chain businesses on Mars. A long way from Gunnery Sergeant \\\"Furry\\\" Roque during the War. One thing stayed same.\\n\\n\\\"My beautiful brilliant star, my '1 of 1', has nothing to do with this. I promised her family, her mother, to keep Elena safe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have my word, that 'Lenamay' is not a part of this.”\\n\\nJacob thought about his Uncle AL and how AL tried to protect him after Jacob Sr.'s passing. Across the room, he saw 'Lenamay' wave at Fernanda. Fernanda waved back and rose from her chair.\\n\\n\\\"Good, I will help.\\\" Fernanda walked over to the other end of the room to embrace her protege. Jacob sat back down, finished his drink, took in one last look of the room an Earth-view, and left.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KIKd3WGPaVoUIEv4G6Ni6.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ec9ki6b3_aUBZQ49bQmZf.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633899978,\"title\":\"1961: 5.19 The Games Within Games, 2913\"},\"digest\":\"BB6MDtl27FZWnd4C53Ef7_FCDfyEBpvs3LfOcvHs5Oo\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Qba9JgCq94I1tMZMH_B6LOvG5oW0pBIQbuTF_nX_BEzZARldBV0r5CFGD0W2SuSc2cYY5DUT-_Ko5JQXiUpgMw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"6uT01asiV6BD7gh_RRYS3Nl9bNkrtRp4YmEIzVKt7Gw\"}"
