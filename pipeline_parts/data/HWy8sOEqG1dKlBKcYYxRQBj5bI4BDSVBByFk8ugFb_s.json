"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It's a new week. Let me tell everyone about anything worth paying attention to.\\n\\nThe first is the ProShares BTC futures ETF, which is expected to be publicly available on October 18; the second is Bakkt, a cryptocurrency exchange, ready to go public.\\n\\nYankee's time is 12 hours slower than ours. We estimate that we will have to wait for the evening to see the results.\\n\\nThey all seem to be positive, but when Coinbase went public in the first half of this year, it was a typical doomsday chariot. I don't know whether it was the collapse of the coinbase stock or the collapse of the coinbase stock.\\n\\nAnyway, the result has been more than half a year, and it has only begun to slow down. Coinbase went public on April 14th, and BTC also set a record high of 64,854 US dollars on this day.\\n\\nCoinbase stock is also the pinnacle of its debut. It hit a peak of US$443 on the same day. Then, like the currency circle, it set a low of US$208 at 519, a drop of more than 50%.\\n\\nAfter that, it has been hovering at the bottom. The currency circle began to reverse on July 20. Coinbase stocks also began to pick up in these two days. When BTC reached 53,000 US dollars and confirmed the bottom again, it also bottomed out.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of subsequent performance, coinbase's stock is completely following the rhythm of BTC, and the trend is exactly the same, but it will lag behind by one or two days.\\n\\nIn fact, this is a very good wealth password. You can use the time difference to sell high and buy low on coinbase stocks.\\n\\nI think this is a good trend. Before the currency circle was always in the shadow of the US stock market, a slight turmoil in the traditional financial market could make the currency circle go into war.\\n\\nThis time BTC is approaching the previous high, and it is finally a phenomenon that some stocks are going out of the independent market.\\n\\nAfter Bakkt is listed on the exchange, it is too probable that it will fluctuate with the trend of BTC. If you have channels, you can try it.\\n\\nThe entire U.S. stock market seems to be trending towards new highs. Comrade Ma Yilong has become the world’s richest man again because of Tesla’s return to 800 U.S. dollars. At the beginning of the year, Tesla’s stock reached 900 U.S. dollars. Almost cut in half.\\n\\nSpeaking of it, it seems that several large domestic Internet companies are also close to being cut in half, and large foreign funds are buying the bottom.\",\"timestamp\":1634575565,\"title\":\"Wealth password brought by exchange listing\"},\"digest\":\"i1N_PmC5X7RAotHEJgexz2826Q6hXLK63TdIpHkPA6U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd2D723FEa3DB671FFE3bd8DbC449734770cB41b6\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Cs4489iK0AHzsHqZWwquWBAg1Tx2wUY6J53G8mOo-VQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UFDXfylYesBc-FDTkIG7ne8qMdAEYOHbfftGP-fMNVQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"UFJ4dzV9hm3Jr3a2VOREzd5q_vz9W-MnzSvEM2fZc6nCnbPn_LWJJeMbJ4igcsL2gS8H5TG6DpOOhZ6Z6w6pbA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc44605e2f12f9b064152da9fd2f00ae0c384b6818548fb5a6cb49e77ca38efd66059955957e449b155ab8c0106efc04f505090def38568d67e0f8253d1ac0c5f1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Cs4489iK0AHzsHqZWwquWBAg1Tx2wUY6J53G8mOo-VQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"UFDXfylYesBc-FDTkIG7ne8qMdAEYOHbfftGP-fMNVQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"i1N_PmC5X7RAotHEJgexz2826Q6hXLK63TdIpHkPA6U\"}"
