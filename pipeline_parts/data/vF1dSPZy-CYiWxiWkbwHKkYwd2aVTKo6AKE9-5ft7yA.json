"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"‘New’ alt assets are having their moment…\\n\\nIn just the last month, a digital artwork by Beeple sold for $69m, Jack Dorsey auctioned off his first ever tweet for $2.9m, and then, of course, this…\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/sHmLEIeYLEXcwo5jz00Cu.jpeg?height=810&width=1215)\\n\\n…an original Banksy being destroyed and turned into a Non-Fungible Token (NFT), which was then sold for 4x its original value.\\n\\nThere’s no shortage of commentary on some of the technology and macro-drivers behind this, so I won’t labour on them here, but at a high level we’re seeing the perfect storm of:\\n\\n* A low interest rate environment creating a hunt for yield\\n* Increasing consumer interest in investing in products and brands we know and love\\n* Companies staying private longer, reducing opportunities in the public markets\\n* Growing wealth flowing onto the blockchain\\n\\nWe have more investors, interested in more types of assets, and we’re finally getting the technological revolution required to enable this.\\n\\nWhat really interests me, however, is not so much the ability to buy ownership of tweets, digital artwork or sports cards (although I’ve spent my fair share on Sorare recently), but rather the broader capital markets and wealth building opportunities for alternative asset classes as a whole.\\n\\nAlt assets themselves are nothing new. Institutions and High-Net-Worth Individuals have been investing in ‘old’ alt assets, such as real estate, commodities and private equity for decades (and in increasing volume). But for consumers and SMEs, this is less the case. Many wealth-building assets have become increasingly inaccessible (e.g. property), remained stubbornly illiquid (e.g. start-up equity) or left unrecognised by lenders as collateral, therefore reducing opportunities for leverage. \\n\\nIt’s across these three areas of **Access**, **Liquidity** and **Leverage**, that I get most excited and where we’re actively investing at Mouro Capital.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aje_ggAtdpLw418A4Ca0K.png?height=541&width=1385)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636209914,\"title\":\"A-L-L in on Alt Assets\"},\"digest\":\"y5Yk5ppG-oKvjGRdM1XsJ8ccPUUWvdJ1hr50piZn--0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3e3e1Eb3489205747679b26c4092AcBa17b7cD78\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"plj1YX_WWFLnsdswZplNfYvw2Eq7MT0N8BCWqUPgeBc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ji3y0f_unylUShwV0DAHxEJJbG-g2G6fX0FrWpzj8IA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"drS1yRZf3b7E8RWj2HOZo7qbs2oUPxbNJF1gut_Tnn9uytkmXOWiQOMY3BdvWQ0z3e2O77fuoUS36GSg1BWH2w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x39a814c5c4bb613d3d1f2ceac02e8f1bc6f95390b2322dad3f32086bbc08e7df67b3f851af393d3d47d988487997a497d662f2f2a47821de57591fef396e89771b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"plj1YX_WWFLnsdswZplNfYvw2Eq7MT0N8BCWqUPgeBc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Ji3y0f_unylUShwV0DAHxEJJbG-g2G6fX0FrWpzj8IA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"y5Yk5ppG-oKvjGRdM1XsJ8ccPUUWvdJ1hr50piZn--0\"}"
