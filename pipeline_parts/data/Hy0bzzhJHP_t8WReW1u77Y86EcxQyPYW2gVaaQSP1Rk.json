"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It is an honor to enter the Beta testing of DappioWonderland as an additional addition to the list.\\n\\nSpecial thanks to: Skywalker for always supporting and trusting me.\\n\\nWhen I entered the app and saw the Dashboard, it truly made me happy, I just love this kind of integrated panel.\\n\\n![DappioWonderland main panel](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9CBU9OH_D0yn_1ZCacZgU.png?height=1184&width=1980)\\n\\nEspecially for people like me who remember things very messy, this panel is very clear at a glance (please ignore the author's poverty T_T).\\n\\nSuggestions: I hope you can customize the size and position of each module on your own, so that you can adjust the places you need to see at a glance according to your needs.\\n\\n![Swag](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Iks1QIj0q4VMRVE1R0ywZ.png?height=1270&width=1014)\\n\\nSwag is consistent with the Swag we are used to, can quickly after (please again ignore the author's poverty T_T)\\n\\nAnd I think the advantage is the red arrow pointing to the place, is a refresh countdown, can let the user more clear about the timeliness of the issue.\\n\\nAnd according to the white paper said the future of the decentralized exchange aggregator is still worth looking forward to, now for the time being has not experienced the choice of exchanges.\\n\\nSuggestion: The text image in the Swag panel is a bit vague? A slight adjustment of the pixels would be nice.\\n\\n![Farm](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XQQmW08rNmsovng56dkNg.png?height=1170&width=1980)\\n\\n![ZAP interface](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pqEdykuVDMsvbjM2FbxBV.png?height=1266&width=1909)\\n\\nThe farm is quite clear at a glance, which piece you like to farm which piece, also has the author like a small circle countdown.\\n\\nPoke in, select a farm, select a coin, a ZAP into the soul, immediately start farming, properly find the income.\\n\\nThe TVL and APR are both clear at a glance, there is nothing special to say.\\n\\nSuggestions: None at this time.\\n\\n![Lending](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/fvupLOiEAzS0jbgwbuBDN.png?height=558&width=1981)\\n\\nThe lending is not yet available as an option, probably because the author is too poor and does not want to lend money to the author \\\\~ ha, just kidding.\\n\\nI think this stage of advancing the bar, the function already exists or the author's network problems, or the need to access more lending agreements.\\n\\nWe'll see.\\n\\nThe strategy center as well as the cross-chain bridge are still in development, but both are more of the author's concern.\\n\\nThe author needs to make a more informed choice to replace his own decision in the investment.\\n\\nAs for the cross-chain bridge, the author has suffered from looking around for a place to cross the chain after the app crossed the chain. He also got the steps of cross-chaining wrong and ended up in a black hole, saying goodbye to my coins.\\n\\nSo the integration of the cross-chain bridge is very convenient, at least I don't have to go to Google to search, identify the authenticity, go in, cross-chain and then return to the place I need to use.\\n\\n![TVL Ranking](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/GODEKK9CECDPEHwWZQFXi.png?height=1271&width=1413)\\n\\nThe last feature is TVL's Ranking, which remains intuitive and simple, realizing what the white paper says can be compared all at once, without having to run around the site to make comparisons.\\n\\n==============================================================\\n**Summary**\\n\\nSo far, I can feel that DappioWonderland, step by step, is doing what the whitepaper describes.\\n\\nIt is an easy to use, comprehensive and convenient platform system.\\n\\nThis is very important for newbies to get started and invest without too much learning cost.\\n\\nIt also proves that the project is strong enough to achieve its goals on time and with high quality.\\n\\nAnd this is only part of the whole DappioWonderland, there is also the NFT part, the STK part, all of which is very much to be expected.\\n\\nIt will be a closed-loop, self-contained system!\\n\\nLooking forward to the next test!\\n\\nI will also go to raise funds to do in-depth testing!\",\"timestamp\":1640937997,\"title\":\"Dappio Beta Test Feedback\"},\"digest\":\"nb9uFoy8b23_z1bVjRZWp7PXgEP3JwHyVBx_Lb_DsNk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd69ae6Dd8eE3AE6d430570e5a79496eC98313E69\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vx37A_egaJ0kvbJKrGuD8BFYH3doqhFekwAcAXhzyjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G8YWCkX8wgCTN1PtCc_fCTneQN_6SX97S1UAUc5lDwU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uIf9T9qGBSQAEZ6SNTNHA3LP0vUl6RaqcYDXga7a-qjtS3kr4deimDfNk5WxyZ2_EDNqxCiE5_MyznGY1Tvm1A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb3df0c1d30a3c23b95bb631d22e418fb870b5603f6abf5b76a04c077f461c55f2cfbc6b221e74d0d0f1df50e5af707fc7885f3b4661d61fac4e47c44520bb1401c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vx37A_egaJ0kvbJKrGuD8BFYH3doqhFekwAcAXhzyjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"G8YWCkX8wgCTN1PtCc_fCTneQN_6SX97S1UAUc5lDwU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"p4-tPABVVzJla_tJix_9s6BUgB19NwBupAFlL3u9a44\"}"
