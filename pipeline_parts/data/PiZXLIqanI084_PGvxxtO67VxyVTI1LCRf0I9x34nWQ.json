"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"so transparently innocent and girlish in her disappointment, that it told her mother something she was glad to know. Not that she had doubted it--but she was glad to know.\\n\\n\\\"We came to look for you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, but I was only on the cliff, where I always go. I was there having a little talk with Ruffo.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you never called me, Madre!\\\" Vere looked openly hurt. \\\"Why didn't you?\\\"\\n\\nIn truth, Hermione hardly knew. Surely it had been Emile who had led them away from the singing voice of Ruffo.\\n\\n\\\"Ruffo was singing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A song about Mergellina. Did you hear it? I do like it and the way he sings it.\\\"\\n\\nThe annoyance had gone from her face at the thought of the song.\\n\\n\\\"And when he sings he looks so careless and gay. Did you listen?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, for a moment, and then we went away. I think it was Emile who made us go. He didn't want to disturb you, I think.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I understand.\\\"\\n\\nVere's face softened. Again Hermione felt a creeping jealousy at her heart. Vere had surely been annoyed with her, but now she knew that it was Emile who had not wished to disturb the /tete-a-tete/ on the cliff she did not mind. She even looked as if she were almost touched. Could the mother be wrong where the mere friend was right? She felt, when Vere spoke and her expression changed, the secret understanding from which she was excluded.\\n\\n\\\"What is the matter, Madre?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The matter! Nothing. Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You looked so odd for a minute. I thought--\\\"\\n\\nBut she did not express what she had thought, for Hermione interrupted her by saying:\\n\\n\\\"We must get Emile to come for a long day. I wish you would write him a note to-morrow morning, Vere. Write for me and ask him to come on Thursday. I have a lot to do in the morning. Will you save me the trouble?\\\" She tried to speak, carelessly. \\\"I've a long letter to send to Evelyn Townley,\\\" she added.\\n\\n\\\"Of course, Madre. And I'll tell Monsieur Emile all I think of him for neglecting us as he has. Ah! But I remember; he's been working.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, he's been working; and one must forgive everything to the worker, mustn't one?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To such a worker as Monsieur Emile is, yes. I do wish you'd let me read his books, Madre.\\\"\\n\\nFor a moment Hermione hesitated, looking at her child.\\n\\n\\\"Why are you so anxious to read them all of a sudden?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Well, I'm growing up and--and I understand things I used not to understand.\\\"\\n\\nHer eyes fell for a moment before her mother's, and there was a silence, in which the mother felt some truth withheld. Vere looked up again.\\n\\n\\\"And I want to appreciate Monsieur Emile properly--as you do, Madre. It seems almost ridiculous to know him so well, and not to know him really at all.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you do know him really.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure he puts most of his real self into his work.\\\"\\n\\nHermione remembered her conception of Emile Artois long ago, when she only knew him through two books; that she had believed him to be cruel, that she had thought her nature must be in opposition to his. Vere did not know that side of \\\"Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere, it is true you are growing up,\\\" she said, speaking rather slowly, as if to give herself time for something. \\\"Perhaps I was wrong the other day in what I said. You may read Emile's books if you like.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Madre!\\\"\\n\\nVere's face flushed with eager pleasure.\\n\\n\\\"Thank you, Madre!\\\"\\n\\nShe went up to bed radiant.\\n\\nWhen she had gone Hermione stood where she was. She had just done a thing that was mean, or at least she had done a thing from a mean, a despicable motive. She knew it as the door shut behind her child, and she was frightened of herself. Never before had she been governed by so contemptible a feeling as that which had just prompted her. If Emile ever knew, or even suspected what it was, she felt that she could never look into his face again with clear, unfaltering eyes. What madness was upon her? What change was working within her? Repulsion came, and with it the desire to combat at once, strongly, the new, the hateful self which had frightened her.\\n\\nShe hastened after Vere, and in a moment was knocking at the child's door.\\n\\n\\\"Who's there? Who is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere!\\\" called the mother.\\n\\nAs she called she tried the door, and found it locked.\\n\\n\\\"Madre! It's you!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. May I come in?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"One tiny moment.\\\"\\n\\nThe voice within sounded surely a little startled and uneven, certainly not welcoming. There was a pause. Hermione heard the rustling of paper, then a drawer shut sharply.\\n\\nVere was hiding away her poems!\\n\\nWhen Hermione understood that she felt the strong, good impulse suddenly shrivel within her, and a bitter jealousy take its place. Vere came to the door and opened it.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, come in, Madre! What is it?\\\" she asked.\\n\\nIn her bright eyes there was the look of one unexpectedly disturbed. Hermione glanced quickly at the writing-table.\\n\\n\\\"You--you weren't writing my note to Monsieur Emile?\\\" she said.\\n\\nShe stepped into the room. She wished she could force Vere to tell her about the poems, but without asking. She felt as if she could not continue in her present condition, excluded from Vere's confidence. Yet she knew now that she could never plead for it.\\n\\n\\\"No, Madre. I can do it to-morrow.\\\"\\n\\nVere looked and sounded surprised, and the mother felt more than ever like an intruder. Yet something dogged kept her there.\\n\\n\\\"Are you tired, Vere?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Not a bit.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then let us have a little talk.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Of course.\\\"\\n\\nVere shut the door. Hermione knew by the way she shut it that she wanted to be alone, to go on with her secret occupation. She came back slowly to her mother, who was sitting on a chair by the bedside. Hermione took her hand, and Vere pushed up the edge of the mosquito- curtain and sat down on the bed.\\n\\n\\\"About those books of Emile's--\\\" Hermione began.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, Madre, you're not going to-- But you've promised!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then I may?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should you wish to read such books? They will probably make you sad, and--and they may even make you afraid of Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Afraid! Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I remember long ago, before I knew him, I had a very wrong conception of him, gained from his books.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but I know him beforehand. That makes all the difference.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A man like Emile has many sides.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think we all have, Madre. Don't you?\\\"\\n\\nVere looked straight at her mother. Hermione felt that a moment had come in which, perhaps, she could force the telling of that truth which already she knew.\\n\\n\\\"I suppose so, Vere; but we need not surely keep any side hidden from those we love, those who are nearest to us.\\\"\\n\\nVere looked a little doubtful--even, for a moment, slightly confused.\\n\\n\\\"N--o?\\\" she said.\\n\\nShe seemed to consider something. Then she added:\\n\\n\\\"But I think it depends. If something in us might give pain to any one we love, I think we ought to try to hide that. I am sure we ought.\\\"\\n\\nHermione felt that each of them was thinking of the same thing, even speaking of it without mentioning it. But whereas she knew that Vere was doing so, Vere could not know that she was. So Vere was at a disadvantage. Vere's last words had opened the mother's eyes. What she had guessed was true. This secret of the poems was kept from her because of her own attempt to create and its failure. Abruptly she wondered if Vere and Emile had ever talked that failure over. At the mere thought of such a conversation her whole body tingled. She got up from her chair.\\n\\n\\\"Well, good-night, Vere,\\\" she said.\\n\\nAnd she left the room, leaving her child amazed.\\n\\nVere did not understand why her mother had come, nor why, having come, she abruptly went away. There was something the matter with her mother. She had felt that for some time. She was more conscious than ever of it now. Around her mother there was an atmosphere of uneasiness in which she felt herself involved. And she was vaguely conscious of the new distance between them, a distance daily growing wider. Now and then, lately, she had felt almost uncomfortable with her mother, in the sitting-room when she was saying good-night, and just now when she sat on the bed. Youth is terribly quick to feel hostility, however subtle. The thought that her mother could be hostile to her had never entered Vere's head. Nevertheless, the mother's faint and creeping hostility--for at times Hermione's feeling was really that, thought she would doubtless have denied it even to herself--disagreeably affected the child.\\n\\n\\\"What can be the matter with Madre?\\\" she thought.\\n\\nShe went over to the writing-table, where she had hastily shut up her poems on hearing the knock at the door, but she did not take them out again. Instead she sat down and wrote the note to Monsieur Emile. As she wrote the sense of mystery, of uneasiness, departed from her, chased away, perhaps, by the memory of Monsieur Emile's kindness to her and warm encouragement, by the thought of having a long talk with him again, of showing him certain corrections and developments carried out by her since she had seen him. The sympathy of the big man meant a great deal to her, more even than he was aware of. It lifted up her eager young heart. It sent the blood coursing through her veins with a new and ardent strength. Hermione's enthusiasm had been inherited by Vere, and with it something else that gave it a peculiar vitality, a power of lasting--the secret consciousness of talent.\\n\\nNow, as she wrote her letter, she forgot all her uneasiness, and her pen flew.\\n\\nAt last she sighed her name--\\\"Vere.\\\"\\n\\nShe was just going to put the letter into its envelope when something struck her, and she paused. The she added:\\n\\n\\\"P.S.--Just now Madre gave me leave to read your books.\\\"\\n\\nCHAPTER XXV\\n\\nThe words of the old Oriental lingered in the mind of Artois. He was by nature more fatalistic than Hermione, and moreover he knew what she did not. Long ago he had striven against a fate. With the help of Gaspare he had conquered it--or so he had believed till now. But now he asked himself whether he had not only delayed its coming. If his suspicion were well founded,--and since his last visit to the island he felt as if it must be,--then surely all he had done with Gaspare would be in vain at the last.\\n\\nIf his suspicion were well founded, then certain things are ordained. They have to happen for some reason, known only to the hidden Intelligence that fashions each man's character, that develops it in joy or grief, that makes it glad with feasting, or forces it to feed upon the bread of tears.\\n\\nDid Gaspare know? If the truth were what Artois suspected, and Gaspare did know it, what would Gaspare do?\\n\\nThat was a problem which interested Artois intensely.\\n\\nThe Sicilian often said of a thing \\\"E il Destino.\\\" Yet Artois believed that for his beloved Padrona he would fight to the death. He, Artois, would leave this fight against destiny to the Sicilian. For him the Oriental's philosophy; for him resignation to the inevitable, whatever it might be.\\n\\nHe said to himself that to do more than he had already done to ward off the assaults of truth would be impious. Perhaps he ought never to have done anything. Perhaps it would have been far better to have let the wave sweep over Hermione long ago. Perhaps even in that fight of his there had been secret selfishness, the desire that she should not know how by his cry from Africa her happy life had been destroyed. And perhaps he was to be punished some day for that.\\n\\nHe did not know. But he felt, after all these years, that if to that hermitage of the sea Fate had really found the way he must let things take their course. And it seemed to him as if the old Oriental had been mysteriously appointed to come near him just at that moment, to make him feel that this was so. The Oriental had been like a messenger sent to him out of that East which he loved, which he had studied, but from which, perhaps, he had not learned enough.\\n\\nVere's letter came. He read it with eagerness and pleasure till he came to the postscript. But that startled him. He knew that Vere had never read his books. He thought her far too young to read them. Till lately he had almost a contempt for those who write with one eye on \\\"la jeune fille.\\\" Now he could conceive writing with a new pleasure something that Vere might read. But those books of his! Why had Hermione suddenly given that permission? He remembered Peppina. Vere must have told her mother of the scene with Peppina, and how her eyes had been opened to certain truths of life, how she had passed from girlhood to womanhood through that gate of knowledge. And Hermione must have thought that it was useless to strive to keep Vere back.\\n\\nBut did he wish Vere to read all that he had written?\\n\\nOn Thursday he went over to the island with mingled eagerness and reluctance. That little home in the sea, washed by blue waters, rooted by blue skies, sun-kissed and star-kissed by day and night, drew and repelled him. There was the graciousness of youth there, of youth and promise; but there was tragedy there, too, in the heart of Hermione, and in Peppina, typified by the cross upon her cheek. And does not like draw like?\\n\\nFor a moment he saw the little island with a great cloud above it. But when he landed and met Vere he felt the summer, and knew that the sky was clear.\\n\\nHermione was not on the island, Vere told him. She had left many apologies, and would be home for lunch. She had had to go in to Naples to see the dentist. A tooth had troubled her in the night. She had gone by tram. As Vere explained Artois had a moment of surprise, a moment of suspicion--even of vexation. But it passed when Vere said:\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid poor Madre suffered a great deal. She looked dreadful this morning, as if she hadn't slept all night.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Poveretta!\\\" said Artois.\\n\\nHe looked earnestly at Vere. This was the first time they had met since the revelation of Peppina. What the Marchesino had seen Artois saw more plainly, felt more strongly than the young Neapolitan had felt. But he looked at Vere, too, in search of something else, thinking of Ruffo, trying to probe into the depth of human mysteries, to find the secret spring that carried child to child.\\n\\n\\\"What do you want, Monsieur Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I want to know how the work goes,\\\" he answered, smiling.\\n\\nShe flushed a little.\\n\\n\\\"And I want to tell you something,\\\" he added. \\\"My talk with you roused me up. Vere, you set me working as I have not worked for a long while.\\\"\\n\\nA lively pleasure showed in her face.\\n\\n\\\"Is that really true? But then I must be careful, or you will never come to see us any more. You will always be shut up in the hotel writing.\\\"\\n\\nThey mounted the cliff together and, without question or reply, as by a mutual instinct, turned towards the seat that faced Ischia, clear to-day, yet romantic with the mystery of heat. When they had sat down Vere added:\\n\\n\\\"And besides, of course, I know that it is Madre who encourages you when you are depressed about your work. I have heard you say so often.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Your mother has done a great deal for me,\\\" said Artois, seriously-- \\\"far more than she will ever know.\\\"\\n\\nThere was a sound of deep, surely of eternal feeling in his voice, which suddenly touched the girl to the quick.\\n\\n\\\"I like to hear you say that--like that,\\\" she said, softly. \\\"I think Madre does a great deal for us all.\\\"\\n\\nIf Hermione could have heard them her torn heart might perhaps have ceased to bleed. It had been difficult for her to do what she had done --to leave the island that morning. She had done it to discipline her nature, as Passionists scourge themselves by night before the altar. She had left Emile alone with Vere simply because she hated to do it.\\n\\nThe rising up of jealousy in her heart had frightened her. All night she had lain awake feeling this new and terrible emanation from her soul, conscious of this monster that lifted up its head and thrust it forth out of the darkness.\\n\\nBut one merit she had. She was frank with herself. She named the monster before she strove to fight it, to beat it back into the darkness from which it was emerging.\\n\\nShe was jealous, doubly jealous. The monopolizing instinct of strong- natured and deeply affectionate women was fiercely alive in her. Always, no doubt, she had had it. Long ago, when first she was in Sicily alone, she had dreamed of a love in the South--far away from the world. When she married she had carried her Mercury to the exquisite isolation of Monte Amato. And when that love was taken from her, and her child came and was at the age of blossom, she had brought her child to this isle, this hermitage of the sea. Emile, too, her one great friend, she had never wished to share him. She had never cared much to meet him in society. Her instinct was to have him to herself, to be with him alone in unfrequented places. She was greedy or she was timid. Which was it? Perhaps she lacked self-confidence, belief in her own attractive power. Life in the world is a fight. Woman fight for their lovers, fight for their friends, with other women: those many women who are born thieves, who are never happy unless they are taking from their sisters the possessions those sisters care for most. Hermione could never have fought with other women for the love or the friendship of a man. Her instinct, perhaps, was to carry her treasure out of all danger into the wilderness.\\n\\nTwo treasures she had--Vere her child, Emile her friend. And now she was jealous of each with the other. And the enormous difference in their ages made her jealousy seem the more degrading. Nevertheless, she could not feel that it was unnatural. By a mutual act they had excluded her from their lives, had withdrawn from her their confidence while giving it to each other. And their reason for doing this--she was sure of it now--was her own failure to do something in the world of art.\\n\\nShe was jealous of Vere because of that confidence given to Emile, and of Emile because of his secret advice and help to Vere--advice and help which he had not given to the mother, because he had plainly seen that to do so would be useless.\\n\\nAnd when she remembered this Hermione was jealous, too, of the talent Vere must have, a talent she had longed for, but which had been denied to her. For even if Emile . . . and then again came the most hateful suspicion of all--but Emile could not lie about the things of art.\\n\\nHad they spoken together of her failure? Again and again she asked herself the question. They must have spoken. They had spoken. She could almost hear their words--words of regret or of pity. \\\"We must not hurt her. We must keep it from her. We must temper the wind to the shorn lamb.\\\" The elderly man and the child had read together the tragedy of her failure. To the extremes of life, youth and age, she had appeared an object of pity.\\n\\nAnd then she thought of her dead husband's reverence of her intellect, boyish admiration of her mental gifts; and an agony of longing for his love swept over her again, and she felt that he was the only person who had been able to love her really, and that now he was gone there was no one.\\n\\nAt that moment she forgot Gaspare. Her sense of being abandoned, and of being humiliated, swept out many things from her memory. Only Maurice had loved her really. Only he had set her on high, where even the humblest woman longs to be set by some one. Only he had thought her better, braver, more worshipful, more loveable, than any other woman. Such love, without bringing conceit to the creature loved, gives power, creates much of what it believes in. The lack of any such love seems to withdraw the little power that there is.\\n\\nHermione, feeling in this humiliation of the imagination that she was less than nothing, clung desperately to the memory of him who had thought her much. The dividing years were gone. With a strange, a beautiful and terrible freshness, the days of her love came back. She saw Maurice's eyes looking at her with that simple, almost reverent admiration which she had smiled at and adored.\\n\\nAnd she gripped her memory. She clung to it feverishly as she had never clung to it before. She told herself that she would live in it as in a house of shelter. For there was the desolate wind outside.\\n\\nAnd she thought much of Ruffo, and with a strange desire--to be with him, to search for the look she loved in him. For a moment with him she had seemed to see her Mercury in the flesh. She must watch for his return.\\n\\nWhen the morning came she began her fight. She made her excuse, and left the morning free for Emile to be with Vere.\\n\\nTwo dreary hours she spent in Naples. The buzzing city affected her like a nightmare. Coming back through Mergellina, she eagerly looked for Ruffo. But she did not see him. Nor had she seen him in the early morning, when she passed by the harbor where the yachts were lying in the sun.\\n\\nGaspare came with the boat to take her over from the nearest village to the island.\\n\\n\\\"Don Emilio has come?\\\" she asked him, as she stepped into the boat.\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora. He has been on the island a long time.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare sat down facing his Padrona and took the oars. As he rowed the boat out past the ruined \\\"Palace of the Spirits\\\" he looked at Hermione, and it seemed to her that his eyes pitied her.\\n\\nCould Gaspare see what she was feeling, her humiliation, her secret jealousy? She felt as if she were made of glass. But she returned his gaze almost sternly, and said:\\n\\n\\\"What's the matter, Gaspare? Why do you look at me like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Signora!\\\"\\n\\nHe seemed startled, and slightly reddened, then looked hurt and almost sulky.\\n\\n\\\"May I not look at you, Signora?\\\" he asked, rather defiantly. \\\"Have I the evil eye?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No--no, Gaspare! Only--only you looked at me as if something were the matter. Do I look ill?\\\"\\n\\nShe asked the question with a forced lightness, with a smile. He answered, bluntly:\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora. You look very ill.\\\"\\n\\nShe put up her hand to her face instinctively, as if to feel whether his words were true.\\n\\n\\\"But I'm perfectly well,\\\" she said.\\n\\n\\\"You look very ill, Signora,\\\" he returned.\",\"timestamp\":1637314657,\"title\":\"\\nThere was a touch of reproach in Vere's tone, and there was something so transparently natural\"},\"digest\":\"3H2zbSs5V8gu9Fuo-6qoR-Xq_2rJ6MZbCn4vqUSa46o\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xeCFFC09a569272AB1413A3E9E440BC486ddb0a97\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xAgiGLrNbRmRMvEc_rZUq3VLoc2bmHloO2XISl_oiqQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5aQS8c5Cg9bFFsSqd7k6n78WV3_tzLfs5IB0d72I-mo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1j_HFCPPvYFVPlXGI4NC8PsXQSo1bk1l4kD9CB1PrY8BVKxl65IJOsRMPbRYt41NUdrSDkflF3_btGGW3u27-A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5da4732bf12e7bd6971e7eb93180be524c07b5335ed5891ff05529fddd357f0d3d5ead0f02b24b2a63e4aeb41786c5f2d46420a8c4ac11ce1accc308f9392bf41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"xAgiGLrNbRmRMvEc_rZUq3VLoc2bmHloO2XISl_oiqQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5aQS8c5Cg9bFFsSqd7k6n78WV3_tzLfs5IB0d72I-mo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"3H2zbSs5V8gu9Fuo-6qoR-Xq_2rJ6MZbCn4vqUSa46o\"}"
