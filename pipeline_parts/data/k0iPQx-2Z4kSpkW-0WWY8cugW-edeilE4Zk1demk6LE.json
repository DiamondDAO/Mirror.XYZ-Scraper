"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## A FOUNDATIONAL COIN FOR THE FUTURE GOOD OF W3\\n\\n### Compassion Takes Courage: Are you ready to FIGHT FOR GOOD?\\n\\nAre you old enough to remember the pitch of Web 2.0 to empower its users, to promote creativity, and to democratize information production? That sounds like the same promises being echoed for Web 3.0 now. Of course this time it’s going to be different, right?\\n\\nMore than a decade since Web 2.0 emerged and connected us, we can clearly see how it failed us. Our attention got monetized. Content was made for addiction, not value. The network effect of social platforms benefited the platforms. Our data made other people rich. Social media was weaponized to influence elections. Meanwhile the world burned. \\n\\nHow do we build the spaces that align incentives between the makers, the stakeholders, the user, the members, and our global community of today and tomorrow?\\n\\nThe advent of decentralization gives us elements like cryptocurrency, smart contracts and DeFi. Together such protocols enable the emergence of new possibilities for how the connected world operates. Perhaps the best example of Web 3.0 emergence is the decentralized organization, the DAO, where membership moves the control back to the people.\\n\\nDecentralization technology can reinvent Web 2.0 to fulfill its promise, not to mention positively disrupt the foundations of national and global infrastructures in ways that meaningfully improve the world. \\n\\nIt’s time for us to build a currency that aligns our incentives along with a DAO that rewards us for building, supporting and making an impact not just on our own lives or members of the DAO but also, bringing more GOOD into the world in it’s different forms.\\n\\nLike the (3,3) concept introduced by the Olympus DAO. The underlying idea is that when all parties of the DAO stake their coins, everyone can make more money and the project becomes more successful. We build on the shoulders of that premise and extend it to giving. As a society, we believe it’s not enough that we enrich ourselves, we have to support those with lesser opportunity. Together, we will all rise and prosper. Introducing:  (4,4). The 4th quadrant of our model is that of GIVING - of adding GOOD to the world.\\n\\n🥊  Play the games or engage in experiences with your GOOD-backed NFTs \\n\\n💰  Earn money from playing and (soon) by holding your NFTs\\n\\n⚡ Invest your GOOD tokens in a staking mechanism to benefit the project and a % goes to the giving pot to be distributed for GOOD causes selected by the DAO.\\n\\n💝  Impact the world with the charitable aspect of the project, just by being involved. Hold GOOD or participate in a GOOD project to Earn & Give.\\n\\nEveryone wins, including the world. \\n\\nWelcome to GOOD. And introducing the GOOD Coin. \\n\\n> ### The GOOD mission is to build a community-led platform that incentivizes collaboration, compassionate support, and inclusive impact -- while letting members own equity in the GOOD they help construct. On the intersection of Philanthropy and Greed, we believe you can give money while making it.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/RoXX-qjfCkcCvH_Di7khH.jpeg?height=1024&width=1024)\\n\\n## Here’s our plan to set this up for sustainable success:\\n\\n### GOOD launch partner: A Game Doing Good\\n\\n* [EFC: Elf Fight Club](https://mirror.xyz/0x949Af18C275938555be346A333e84ff2F56Cc4B8)\\n  * Cultivating Web 3.0 is a FIGHT FOR GOOD, so we partnered up with a world class game team that is creating a fighting game using the characters that most embody selflessness: Santa’s Helpers, the elves. \\n  * 50% of all minting and secondary sales proceeds, 5% of all match proceeds, and a percentage of every transaction on the platform will be automatically routed to a wallet dedicated for giving (season 1 ‘s charity will be [The World Food Programme](http://wfp.org/) and next year the DAO will vote for the recipients). \\n  * This holiday season the EFC has the audacious goal of raising enough to feed 2^17 (131072) Kids for an entire year via the WFP audited outreach.\\n\\n### Initial distribution of tokens for the member community\\n\\n* Enabling a project management and productivity platform on [Wonder](https://www.wonderverse.xyz/).\\n* Creation of permissions, with hierarchical and decentralized governance structures.\\n* Users will be rewarded $GOOD\\\\* tokens whenever they complete productive actions for approved projects. \\n* There will be a finite number of tasks related to GOOD that will be rewarded. Tokens cannot be bought during this phase. Think of this as our airdrop.\\n* As a community we plan to give funding to other projects like EFC that follow the GOOD creed and use it for it’s transactions.\\n\\n### Create value for the community\\n\\n* Launch community challenges/challenges for rewards (i.e. build your first decentralized application for $GOOD tokens).\\n* Enable users to set task bounties for other users to complete via $GOOD tokens.\\n* Social NFTs that can be rewarded based on completion of certain quests. These are like[ POAPs](https://poap.xyz/) that users can show off.\\n* Users can raise money for their GOOD projects through the community.\\n\\n### Scaling and decentralization\\n\\n* $GOOD tokens can be bought (exchanged with Eth, Fiat, etc).\\n* We decentralized governance and hand the reins to the DAO community, as stated in[ progressive decentralization](https://a16z.com/2020/01/09/progressive-decentralization-crypto-product-management/).\\n* We will continue to have community challenges and make investments in companies on the GOOD platform supporting its creed and bringing more GOOD into the world.\\n\\n## This is about impact. This is a FIGHT FOR GOOD.\\n\\nWe can’t do this alone, nor should we. This is a global fight to right the wrongs of Web 2.0 and preserve the promise of Web 3.0. This is a #FightForGood.\\n\\n> ### Don’t get us wrong, we are not just doing this just for the GOODness of our heart. We are just as greedy as you… But imagine we can all be making big coin together while at the same time bringing more GOOD into the world. That is the magic of the #FIGHTFORGOOD, MERRY 4,4 TO YOU AND YOURS!\\n\\nCompassion takes courage. Are you with us?\\n\\n[https://discord.gg/DfuMTZX4](https://discord.gg/DfuMTZX4)\\n\\nThank you to Wonderverse.xyz for inspiration with our manifesto.\",\"timestamp\":1637779952,\"title\":\"GOOD Manifesto\"},\"digest\":\"hihan2ngS19cs-usMAHY9AVX9vv4YEHdLUe3lZhcgM4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x63E5f81C9d3bCA39e18b05e34716fF54bf9036Dd\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vY0Z7ZEGzRlSQxx3rEuwysVevB7bXYTTmYZJ1E4xsk0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5_9yYPVJ2z3ZIUuQC7A0VApR1vP7VUBrj3vLJALUPzc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"wvaudohcAzpIzzfpJutz05Yn6japC0SYzNZo3hjZ2ZUkgoYEIo8YtVwSXGtSguTdXHINjreG7ebXrUzdYKX6mQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x85bba5ee481b36d4fe2b5590de98f5158840b6e9a43412ec6708a46780e9bd455fc4d5122dc6035b22a373e4830776aaf3a3a212e71a83da89df99e94355c5221b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"vY0Z7ZEGzRlSQxx3rEuwysVevB7bXYTTmYZJ1E4xsk0\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"5_9yYPVJ2z3ZIUuQC7A0VApR1vP7VUBrj3vLJALUPzc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"p-qY12uwucowBRvg0VmdGubrPnSN46OGujjQr-jvA1I\"}"
