"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"and surmounted by nine peaks, from the centre of which protrudes a remarkable pointed tower, formed of four crocodiles' tails intertwined.\\n\\nThe hall itself is small, low, and dark; it contains a full-length portrait in oil of Tycho de Brahe.  Nearly all the upper part of the building is converted into a kind of bazaar, and the lower portion contains a number of small and dingy booths.\\n\\nSeveral canals, having an outlet into the sea, give a peculiar charm to the town.  They are, in fact, so many markets; for the craft lying in them are laden with provisions of all kinds, which are here offered for sale.\\n\\nThe Sailors' Town, adjoining Copenhagen, and situated near the harbour, is singularly neat and pretty.  It consists of three long, broad, straight streets, built of houses looking so exactly alike, that on a foggy night an accurate knowledge of the locality is requisite to know one from the other.  It looks as though, on each side of the way, there were only one long house of a single floor, with a building one story high in the middle.  In the latter dwell the commandant and overseers.\\n\\nThe lighting of the streets is managed in Copenhagen in the same way as in our smaller German towns.  When \\\"moonlight\\\" is announced in the calendar, not a lamp is lighted.  If the lady moon chooses to hide behind dark clouds, that is her fault.  It would be insolent to attempt to supply the place of her radiance with miserable lamps--a wise arrangement! (?)\\n\\nOf the near walks, the garden of the \\\"Rosenburg,\\\" within the town, pleased me much; as did also the \\\"Long Line,\\\" an alley of beautiful trees extending parallel with the sea, and in which one can either walk or ride.  A coffee-house, in front of which there is music in fine weather, attracts many of the loungers.  The most beautiful place of all is the \\\"Kastell,\\\" above the \\\"Long Line,\\\" from whence one can enjoy a beautiful view.  The town lies displayed below in all its magnificence:  the harbour, with its many ships; the sparkling blue Sound, which spreads its broad expanse between the coasts of Denmark and Sweden, and washes many a beautiful group of islands belonging to one or the other of these countries.  The background of the picture alone is uninteresting, as there is no chain of mountains to form a horizon, and the eye wanders over the boundless flats of Denmark.\\n\\nAmong the vessels lying at anchor in the harbour I saw but few three-masters, and still fewer steamers.  The ships of the fleet presented a curious appearance; at the first view they look like great houses with flag-staves, for every ship is provided with a roof, out of which the masts rise into the air; they are besides very high out of the water, so that all the port-holes and the windows of the cabins appear in two or three stories, one above the other.\\n\\nA somewhat more distant excursion, which can be very conveniently made in a capital omnibus, takes you to the royal chateau \\\"Friedrichsberg,\\\" lying before the water-gate, two miles distant from the town.  Splendid avenues lead to this place, where are to be found all the delights that can combine to draw a citizen into the country.  There are a tivoli, a railway, cabinets, and booths with wax-figures, and countless other sights, besides coffee-houses, beer-rooms, and music.  The gardens are planted at the sides with a number of small arbours, each containing a table and. chairs, and all open in front, so as to shew at one view all the visitors of these pretty natural huts.  On Sundays, when the gardens are crowded, this is a very animated sight.\\n\\nOn the way to this \\\"Prater\\\" of Copenhagen, we pass many handsome villas, each standing in a fine garden.\\n\\nThe royal palace is situated on the summit of a hill, at the end of the avenue, and is surrounded by a beautiful park; it commands a view of a great portion of the town, with the surrounding country and the sea; still I far prefer the prospect from the \\\"Kastell.\\\" The Park contains a considerable island, which, during some part of the year, stands in the midst of an extensive lake.  This island is appropriated to the Court, but the rest of the park is open to the public.\\n\\nImmediately outside the water-gate stands an obelisk, remarkable neither for its beauty nor for the skill displayed in its erection, for it consists of various stones, and is not high, but interesting from the circumstance to which it owes its origin.  It was erected by his grateful subjects in memory of the late king Christian VII., to commemorate the abolition of feudal service.  Surely no feeling person can contemplate without joyful emotion a monument like this.\\n\\nI have here given a faithful account of what I saw during my short stay at Copenhagen.  It only remains for me to describe a few peculiar customs of the people, and so I will begin as it were at the end, with the burial of the dead.  In Denmark, as in fact in the whole of Scandinavia, not excepting Iceland, it is customary not to bury the dead until eight or ten days have elapsed.  In winter-time this is not of so much consequence, but in summer it is far from healthy for those under the same roof with the corpse.  I was present at Copenhagen at the funeral of Dr. Brandis, physician to the king.  Two of the king's carriages and a number of private equipages attended.  Nearly all these were empty, and the servants walked beside them.  Among the mourners I did not notice a single woman; I supposed that this was only the case at the funerals of gentlemen, but on inquiry I found that the same rule is observed at the burial of women.  This consideration for the weaker sex is carried so far, that on the day of the funeral no woman may be seen in the house of mourning.  The mourners assemble in the house of the deceased, and partake of cold refreshments.  At the conclusion of the ceremony they are again regaled.  What particularly pleased me in Copenhagen was, that I never on any occasion saw beggars, or even such miserably clad people as are found only too frequently in our great cities.  Here there are no doubt poor people, as there are such every where else in the world, but one does not see them beg. I cannot help mentioning an arrangement which certainly deserves to be universally carried out;--I mean, the setting apart of many large houses, partly belonging to the royal family, partly to rich private people or to companies, for the reception of poor people, who are here lodged at a much cheaper rate than is possible in ordinary dwellings.\\n\\nThe costumes of the peasants did not particularly please me.  The women wear dresses of green or black woollen stuff, reaching to the ankle, and trimmed at the skirt with broad coloured woollen borders. The seams of the spenser, and the arm-holes, are also trimmed with smaller coloured borders.  On their heads they wear a handkerchief, and over this a kind of shade, like a bonnet.  On Sundays I saw many of them in small, pretty caps, worked with silk, with a border of lace of more than a hand's breadth, plaited very stiffly; at the back they have large bows of fine riband, the ends of which reach half down to their feet.  I found nothing very remarkable in the dress of the peasants.  As far as strength and beauty were concerned, I thought these peasants were neither more nor less gifted than those of Austria.  As regards the beauty of the fair sex, I should certainly give the preference to the Austrians.  Fair hair and blue eyes predominate.\\n\\nI saw but few soldiers; their uniforms, particularly those worn by the king's life-guards, are very handsome.\\n\\nI especially noticed the drummers; they were all little lads of ten or twelve years old.  One could almost have exclaimed, \\\"Drum, whither art thou carrying that boy?\\\"  To march, and to join in fatiguing manoeuvres, carrying such a drum, and beating it bravely at the same time, is rather cruel work for such young lads.  Many a ruined constitution may be ascribed to this custom.\\n\\nDuring my stay in Copenhagen I spent many very delightful hours with Professor Mariboe and his amiable family, and with the kind clergyman of the embassy, Herr Zimmermann.  They received me with true politeness and hospitality, and drew me into their circle, where I soon felt myself quite at ease.  I shall never forget their friendship, and shall make use of every opportunity to shew them my appreciation of it.  Herr Edouard Gottschalk and Herr Knudson have also my best thanks.  I applied to the first of these gentlemen to procure me a passage to Iceland, and he was kind enough to use his interest with Herr Knudson on my behalf.\\n\\nHerr Knudson is one of the first general dealers in Copenhagen, and carries on a larger and more extended commerce with Iceland than any other house trading thither.  He is already beginning to retire, as the continual journeys are becoming irksome to him; but he still owns a number of great and small vessels, which are partly employed in the fisheries, and partly in bringing all kinds of articles of consumption and luxury to the different harbours of Iceland.\\n\\nHe himself goes in one of his ships every year, and stays a few months in Iceland to settle his affairs there.  On the recommendation of Herr Gottschalk, Herr Knudson was kind enough to give me a passage in the ship in which he made the journey himself; a favour which I knew how to value.  It is certainly no small kindness to take a lady passenger on such a journey.  Herr Knudson knew neither my fortitude nor my perseverance; he did not know whether I should be able to endure the hardships of a journey to the north, whether I would bear sea-sickness philosophically, or even if I had courage enough, in case of storms or bad weather, to abstain from annoying the captain by my fears or complaints at a time when he would only have too much to harass him.  The kind man allowed no such considerations to influence him.  He believed me when I promised to behave courageously come what might, and took me with him.  Indeed his kindness went so far that it is to him I owe every comfort I enjoyed in Iceland, and every assistance in furthering the attainment of my journey's object.  I could certainly not have commenced a voyage under better auspices.\\n\\nAll ships visiting Iceland leave Copenhagen at the end of April, or at the latest in the middle of May.  After this time only one ship is despatched, to carry the mails of the Danish government.  This vessel leaves Copenhagen in October, remains in Iceland during the winter months, and returns in March.  The gain or loss of this expedition is distributed in shares among the merchants of Copenhagen.\\n\\nBesides this, a French frigate comes to Iceland every spring, and cruises among the different harbours until the middle of August. She superintends the fishing vessels, which, attracted by the large profits of the fisheries, visit these seas in great numbers during the summer. {17}\\n\\nOpportunities of returning from Iceland occur during the summer until the end of September, by means of the merchant-ships, which carry freights from the island to Denmark, England, and Spain.\\n\\nAt length, on Sunday the 4th of May, a favourable wind sprung up. Herr Knudson sent me word to be ready to embark at noon on board the fine brig John.\\n\\nI immediately proceeded on board.  The anchor was weighed, and the sails, unfolding themselves like giant wings, wafted us gently out of the harbour of Copenhagen.  No parting from children, relations, or old-cherished friends embittered this hour.  With a glad heart I bade adieu to the city, in the joyful hope soon to see the fulfilment of my long-expected journey.\\n\\nThe bright sky smiled above us, and a most favourable wind filled our sails.  I sat on deck and revelled in the contemplation of scenes so new to me.  Behind us lay spread the majestic town; before us the Sound, an immense natural basin, which I could almost compare to a great Swiss lake; on the right and left were the coasts of Sweden and Denmark, which here approach each other so closely that they seem to oppose a barrier to the further progress of the adventurous voyager.\\n\\nSoon we passed the little Swedish town of Carlscrona, and the desolate island Hveen, on which Tycho de Brahe passed the greater portion of his life, occupied with stellar observations and calculations.  Now came a somewhat dangerous part, and one which called into action all the careful seamanship of the captain to bring us safely through the confined sea and the strong current,-- the entrance of the Sound into the Cattegat.\\n\\nThe two coasts here approach to within a mile of each other.  On the Swedish side lies the pretty little town of Helsingborg, on the Danish side that of Helsingor, and at the extremity of a projecting neck of land the fortress Kronburg, which demands a toll of every passing ship, and shews a large row of threatening cannon in case of non-compliance.  Our toll had already been paid before leaving Copenhagen; we had been accurately signalled, and sailed fearlessly by. {18}\\n\\nThe entrance once passed, we entered the Cattegat, which already looked more like the great ocean:  the coasts retired on each side, and most of the shifts and barques, which till now had hovered around us on all sides, bade us \\\"farewell.\\\"  Some bent their course towards the east, others towards the west; and we alone, on the broad desert ocean, set sail for the icy north.  Twilight did not set in until 9 o'clock at night; and on the coasts the flaming beacons flashed up, to warn the benighted mariner of the proximity of dangerous rocks.\\n\\nI now offered up my thanksgiving to Heaven for the protection hitherto vouchsafed me, with a humble prayer for its continuance. Then I descended to the cabin, where I found a convenient bunk (a kind of crib fixed to the side of the ship); I laid myself down, and was soon in a deep and refreshing sleep.\\n\\nI awoke full of health and spirits, which, however, I enjoyed but for a short time.  During the night we had left behind us the \\\"Cattegat\\\" and the \\\"Skagerrack,\\\" and were driving through the stormy German Ocean.  A high wind, which increased almost to a gale, tumbled our poor ship about in such a manner, that none but a good dancer could hope to maintain an upright position.  I had unfortunately been from my youth no votary of Terpsichore, and what was I to do?  The naiads of this stormy region seized me, and bandied me to and fro, until they threw me into the arms of what was, according to my experience, if not exactly after Schiller's interpretation, \\\"the horrible of horrors,\\\"--sea-sickness.  At first I took little heed of this, thinking that sea-sickness would soon be overcome by a traveller like myself, who should be inured to every thing.  But in vain did I bear up; I became worse and worse, till I was at length obliged to remain in my berth with but one consoling thought, namely, that we were to-day on the open sea, where there was nothing worthy of notice.  But the following day the Norwegian coast was in sight, and at all hazards I must see it; so I crawled on deck more dead than alive, looked at a row of mountains of moderate elevation, their tops at this early season still sparkling with their snowy covering, and then hurried back, benumbed by the piercing icy wind, to my good warm feather-bed.  Those who have never experienced it can have no conception of the biting, penetrating coldness of a gale of wind in the northern seas.  The sun shone high in the heavens; the thermometer (I always calculate according to Reaumur) stood 3 degrees above zero; I was dressed much more warmly than I should have thought necessary when, in my fatherland, the thermometer was 8 degrees or 10 degrees BELOW zero, and yet I felt chilled to the heart, and could have fancied that I had no clothes on at all.\\n\\nOn the fourth night we sailed safely past the Shetland Islands; and on the evening of the fifth day we passed so near the majestic rocky group of the Feroe Islands, that we were at one time apprehensive of being cast upon the rocks by the unceasing gale. {19}\\n\\nAlready on the seventh day we descried the coast of Iceland.  Our passage had been unprecedentedly quick; the sailors declared that a favourable gale was to be preferred even to steam, and that on our present voyage we should certainly have left every steamer in our wake.  But I, wretched being that I was, would gladly have dispensed with the services both of gale and steam for the sake of a few hours' rest.  My illness increased so much, that on the seventh day I thought I must succumb.  My limbs were bathed in a cold perspiration; I was as weak as an infant, and my mouth felt parched and dry.  I saw that I must now either make a great effort or give up entirely; so I roused myself, and with the assistance of the cabin-boy gained a seat, and promised to take any and every remedy which should be recommended.  They gave me hot-water gruel with wine and sugar; but it was not enough to be obliged to force this down, I was further compelled to swallow small pieces of raw bacon highly peppered, and even a mouthful of rum.  I need not say what strong determination was required to make me submit to such a regimen.  I had, however, but one choice, either to conquer my repugnance or give myself up a victim to sea-sickness; so with all patience and resignation I received the proffered gifts, and found, after a trial of many hours, that I could manage to retain a small dose.  This physicking was continued for two long, long days, and then I began slowly to recover.\\n\\nI have here circumstantially described both my illness and its cure, because so many people are unfortunately victims to the complaint, and when under its influence cannot summon resolution to take sustenance.  I should advise all my friends not to hold out so long as I did, but to take food at once, and continue to do so until the system will receive it.\\n\\nAs I was now convalescent, I tried to recruit my wearied mind by a diligent study of the mode of life and customs of the mariners of the northern seas.\\n\\nOur ship's company consisted of Herr Knudson, Herr Bruge (a merchant whom we were to land at the Westmann Islands), the captain, the mate, and six or seven sailors.  Our mode of life in the cabin was as follows:  in the morning, at seven o'clock, we took coffee, but whence this coffee came, heaven knows!  I drank it for eleven days, and could never discover any thing which might serve as a clue in my attempt to discover the country of its growth.  At ten o'clock we had a meal consisting of bread and butter and cheese, with cold beef or pork, all excellent dishes for those in health; the second course of this morning meal was \\\"tea-water.\\\"  In Scandinavia, by the way, they never say, \\\"I drink TEA,\\\" the word \\\"water\\\" is always added:  \\\"I drink TEA-WATER.\\\"  Our \\\"tea-water\\\" was, if possible, worse than its predecessor, the incomparable coffee.  Thus I was beaten at all points; the eatables were too strong for me, the drinkables too-- too--I can find no appropriate epithet--probably too artificial.  I consoled myself with the prospect of dinner; but, alas, too soon this sweet vision faded into thin air!  On the sixth day I made my first appearance at the covered table, and could not help at once remarking the cloth which had been spread over it.  At the commencement of our journey it might perhaps have been white; now it was most certainly no longer of that snowy hue.  The continual pitching and rolling of the ship had caused each dish to set its peculiar stamp upon the cloth.  A sort of wooden network was now laid upon it, in the interstices of which the plates and glasses were set, and thus secured from falling.  But before placing it on the table, our worthy cabin-boy took each plate and glass separately, and polished it on a towel which hung near, and in colour certainly rather resembling the dingy floor of the cabin than the bight-hued rainbow.  This could still have been endured, but the article in question really did duty AS A TOWEL in the morning, before extending its salutary influence over plates and glasses for the remainder of the day.\\n\\nOn making discoveries such as these, I would merely turn away my eyes, and try to think that perhaps MY GLASS and MY PLATE would be more delicately manipulated, or probably escape altogether; and then I would turn my whole attention to the expected dishes.\\n\\nFirst came soup; but instead of gravy-soup, it was water-soup, with rice and dried plums.  This, when mingled with red wine and sugar, formed a most exquisite dish for Danish appetites, but it certainly did not suit mine.  The second and concluding course consisted of a large piece of beef, with which I had no fault to find, except that it was too heavy for one in my weak state of health.  At supper we had the same dishes as at dinner, and each meal was followed by \\\"tea-water.\\\"  At first I could not fancy this bill of fare at all; but within a few days after my convalesence, I had accustomed myself to it, and could bear the sea-diet very well. {20}\\n\\nAs the rich owner of the vessel was on board, there was no lack of the best wines, and few evenings passed on which a bowl of punch was not emptied.  There was, however, a reason found why every bottle of wine or bowl of punch should be drunk:  for instance, at our embarkation, to drink the health of the friends we were leaving, and to hope for a quick and prosperous voyage; then, when the wind was favourable, its health was drunk, with the request that it would remain so; when it was contrary, with the request that it would change; when we saw land, we saluted it with a glass of wine, or perhaps with several, but I was too ill to count; when we lost sight of it, we drank a farewell glass to its health:  so that every day brought with it three or four distinct and separate occasions for drinking wine. {21}\\n\\nThe sailors drank tea-water without sugar every morning and evening, with the addition of a glass of brandy; for dinner they had pease, beans, barley, or potatoes, with salted cod, bacon, \\\"or junk;\\\" good sea-biscuit they could get whenever they chose.\\n\\nThe diet is not the worst part of these poor people's hardships. Their life may be called a continual fight against the elements; for it is precisely during the most dreadful storms, with rain and piercing cold, that they have to be continually upon deck.  I could not sufficiently admire the coolness, or rather the cheerfulness and alacrity with which they fulfilled their onerous duties.  And what reward have they?  Scanty pay, for food the diet I have just described, and for their sleeping-place the smallest and most inconvenient part of the ship, a dark place frequently infested with vermin, and smelling offensively from being likewise used as a receptacle for oil-colours, varnish, tar, salt-fish, &c. &c.\\n\\nTo be cheerful in the midst of all this requires a very quiet and contented mind.  That the Danish sailors are contented, I had many opportunities of observing during the voyage of which I am speaking, and on several other occasions.\\n\\nBut after all this long description, it is high time that I should return to the journey itself.\\n\\nThe favourable gale which had thus wafted us to the coast of Iceland within seven days, now unfortunately changed its direction, and drove us back.  We drifted about in the storm-tost ocean, and many a Spanish wave {22} broke completely over our ship.  Twice we attempted to approach the Westmann Islands {23} (a group belonging to Iceland) to watch an opportunity of casting anchor, and setting ashore our fellow-traveller Herr Bruge; but it was in vain, we were driven back each time.  At length, at the close of the eleventh day, we reached Havenfiord, a very good harbour, distant nine miles from Reikjavik, the capital of Iceland.\\n\\nIn spite of the very inopportune change in the direction of the wind, we had had an unprecedentedly quick passage.  The distance from Copenhagen to Iceland, in a straight line, is reckoned at 1200 geographical miles; for a sailing vessel, which must tack now and then, and must go as much with the wind as possible, 1500 to 1600 miles.  Had the strong wind, which was at first so favourable, instead of changing on the seventh day, held on for thirty or forty hours longer, we should have landed in Iceland on the eighth or ninth day--even the steamer could not have accomplished the passage so quickly.\\n\\nThe shores of Iceland appeared to me quite different from what I had supposed them to be from the descriptions I had read.  I had fancied them naked, without tree or shrub, dreary and desert; but now I saw green hills, shrubs, and even what appeared to be groups of stunted trees.  As we came nearer, however, I was enabled to distinguish objects more clearly, and the green hills became human dwellings with small doors and windows, while the supposed groups of trees proved in reality to be heaps of lava, some ten or twelve feet high, thickly covered with moss and grass.  Every thing was new and striking to me; I waited in great impatience till we could land.\\n\\nAt length the anchor descended; but it was not till next morning that the hour of disembarkation and deliverance came.\\n\\nBut one more night, and then, every difficulty overcome, I should tread the shores of Iceland, the longed-for, and bask as it were in the wonders of this island, so poor in the creations of art, so rich in the phenomena of Nature.\\n\\nBefore I land in Iceland, I must trouble the reader with a few preliminary observations regarding this island.  They are drawn from Mackenzie's Description of Iceland, a book the sterling value of which is appreciated every where. {24}\\n\\nThe discovery of Iceland, about the year of our Lord 860, is attributed to the spirit of enterprise of some Swedish and Norwegian pirates, who were drifted thither on a voyage to the Feroe Isles. It was not till the year 874 that the island was peopled by a number of voluntary emigrants, who, feeling unhappy under the dominion of Harold Harfraga (fine hair), arrived at the island under the direction of Ingold. {25}  As the newcomers are said to have found no traces of dwellings, they are presumed to be the first who took possession of the island.\\n\\nAt this time Iceland was still so completely covered with underwood, that at some points it was necessary to cut a passage.  Bringing with them their language, religion, customs, and historical monuments, the Norwegians introduced a kind of feudal system, which, about the year 928, gave place to a somewhat aristocratic government, retaining, however, the name of a republic.  The island was divided into four provinces, over each of which was placed an hereditary governor or judge.\\n\\nThe General Assembly of Iceland (called Allthing) was held annually on the shores of the Lake Thingvalla.  The people possessed an excellent code of laws, in which provision had been made for every case which could occur.\\n\\nThis state of things lasted for more than 300 years, a period which may be called the golden age of Iceland.  Education, literature, and even refined poetry flourished among the inhabitants, who took part in commerce and in the sea-voyages which the Norwegians undertook for purposes of discovery.\\n\\nThe \\\"Sagas,\\\" or histories of this country, contain many tales of personal bravery.  Its bards and historians visited other climes, became the favourites of monarchs, and returned to their island covered with honour and loaded with presents.  The Edda, by Samund, is one of the most valued poems of the ancient days of Iceland.  The second portion of the Edda, called Skalda, dates from a later period, and is ascribed by many to the celebrated Snorri Sturluson. Isleif, first Bishop of Skalholt, was the earliest Icelandic historian; after him came the noted Snorri Sturluson, born in 1178, who became the richest and mightiest man in Iceland.\\n\\nSnorri Sturluson was frequently followed to the General Assembly of Iceland by a splendid retinue of 800 armed men.  He was a great historian and poet, and possessed an accurate knowledge of the Greek and Latin tongues, besides being a powerful orator.  He was also the author of the Heims-kringla.\\n\\nThe first school was founded at Skalholt, about the middle of the eleventh century, under Isleif, first Bishop of Iceland; four other schools and several convents soon followed.  Poetry and music seem to have formed a staple branch of education.\\n\\nThe climate of Iceland appears to have been less inclement than is now the case; corn is said to have grown, and trees and shrubs were larger and thicker than we find them at present.  The population of Iceland was also much more numerous than it is now, although there were neither towns nor villages.  The people lived scattered throughout the island; and the General Assembly was held at Thingvalla, in the open air.\\n\\nFishing constituted the chief employment of the Icelanders.  Their clothing was woven from the wool of their sheep.  Commerce with neighbouring countries opened to them another field of occupation.\\n\\nThe doctrines of Christianity were first introduced into Iceland, in the year 981, by Friederich, a Saxon bishop.  Many churches were built, and tithes established for the maintenance of the clergy. Isleif, first Bishop of Skalholt, was ordained in the year 1057. After the introduction of Christianity, all the Icelanders enjoyed an unostentatious but undisturbed practice of their religion.\\n\\nGreenland and the most northern part of America are said to have been discovered by Icelanders.\\n\\nIn the middle of the thirteenth century Iceland came into the power of the Norwegian kings.  In the year 1380 Norway was united to the crown of Denmark; and Iceland incorporated, without resistance, in the Danish monarchy.  Since the cession of the island to Norway, and then to Denmark, peace and security took the place of the internal commotions with which, before this time, Iceland had been frequently disturbed; but this state of quiet brought forth indolence and apathy.  The voyages of discovery were interfered with by the new government, and the commerce gradually passed into the hands of other nations.  The climate appears also to have changed; and the lessened industry and want of perseverance in the inhabitants have brought agriculture completely into decline.\\n\\nIn the year 1402 the plague broke out upon the island, and carried off two-thirds of the population.\\n\\nThe first printing-press was established at Hoolum, about the year 1530, under the superintendence of the Bishop, John Areson.\\n\\nThe reformation in the Icelandic Church was not brought about without disturbance.  It was legally established in the year 1551.\\n\\nDuring the fifteenth century the Icelanders suffered more from the piratical incursions of foreigners.  As late as the year 1616 the French and English nations took part in these enormities.  The most melancholy occurrence of this kind took place in 1627, in which year a great number of Algerine pirates made a descent upon the Icelandic coast, murdered about fifty of the inhabitants, and carried off nearly 400 others into captivity. {26}\\n\\nThe eighteenth century commenced with a dreadful mortality from the smallpox; of which disease more than 16,000 of the inhabitants died. In 1757 a famine swept away about 10,000 souls.\\n\\nThe year 1783 was distinguished by most dreadful volcanic outbreaks in the interior of the island.  Tremendous streams of lava carried all before them; great rivers were checked in their course, and formed lakes.  For more than a year a thick cloud of smoke and volcanic ashes covered the whole of Iceland, and nearly darkened the sunlight.  Horned cattle, sheep, and horses were destroyed; famine came, with its accompanying illnesses; and once more appeared the malignant small-pox.  In a few years more than 11,000 persons had died; more than one-fourth of the whole present population of the island.\\n\\nIceland lies in the Atlantic ocean; its greatest breadth is 240 geographical miles, and its extreme length from north to south 140 miles.  The number of inhabitants is estimated at 48,000, and the superficial extent of the island at 29,800 square miles.\\n\\nCHAPTER III\",\"timestamp\":1637496184,\"title\":\"The Exchange is a curious ancient building.
