We could not have asked for a better response from the community.\\n\\nWhat was supposed to be a one-off [bounty project](https://gitcoin.co/issue/ArweaveTeam/Bounties/41/100024675) turned out to be the beginning of our entrepreneurial journey fueled by the incredible interest in our solution.\\n\\nFour months later, not only have we launched our [Alpha Testnet](https://kyve.network/gov/pools), but we’re excited to share that we have collaborated and integrated with major blockchains, including [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), [Avalanche](https://www.avalabs.org/), [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/), [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), and [Solana](https://solana.com/).\\n\\nWe are also excited to announce that we have successfully closed a $1M pre-seed round, led by [Permanent Ventures](http://permanent.ventures/) and comprised of notable investors, including leading crypto funds [Hypersphere Ventures](https://hypersphere.ventures/), [4SV](https://www.4sv.io/), [Compute Ventures](https://compute.ventures/), [Lemniscap](https://lemniscap.com/), [Bering Waters](https://ventures.beringwaters.com/), [Mechanism Capital](https://www.mechanism.capital/), [D1 Ventures](https://d1.ventures/), [Volt Capital](https://www.volt.capital/) and a group of strategic angel investors including Mark Heus, [Farid Rached](https://twitter.com/FaridRached), Christian Stroh, [Emanuel Ferm](https://twitter.com/eeferm), [Scott Moore](https://twitter.com/notscottmoore), [Kenneth Ng](https://twitter.com/nkennethk), [lllia Polosukhin](https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon), and [Tate Berenbaum](https://twitter.com/TateBerenbaum). We are likewise proud to count [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/), [Avalanche Foundation](https://www.avalabs.org/), [Interchain Foundation](https://interchain.io/), [NEAR Foundation](https://near.foundation/), and [Solana Foundation](https://www.solana.foundation/) as investors.\\n\\nOur mission is ambitious but necessary: we want to help Web 3.0 projects to reach infinite scalability by storing and computing data reliably and efficiently.\\n\\nWith our decentralized archival framework, we offer a unified solution for all blockchain data needs. We standardize, validate, and permanently store any generated data stream. By [leveraging Arweave](https://kyve.mirror.xyz/JRG-K07Cd49-VaptZCAI1BG45i9qfvjGKWkK61AAg4A), our solution secures the scalability, immutability, and availability of these resources over time.\\n\\n## A brief [intro](https://kyve.mirror.xyz/GRMirQgr0r8yDeVJ_RKcpZLM8LpljUw2IW8Rdvmu8Jo) to KYVE\\n\\nData providers can seamlessly store and verify their data streams by setting up their archiving pool. Each pool is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) powered by [SmartWeave](https://arweave.medium.com/introducing-smartweave-building-smart-contracts-with-arweave-1fc85cb3b632), the Arweave smart contracting language.\\n\\nUploaders and validators secure the validity of the data inside each pool:\\n\\n*   Uploaders fetch data from a source and can perform computational work before storing it on Arweave.\\n*   Validators determine the integrity of the data and have the ability to vote on the slashing of an uploader’s stake if terms are not respected.\\n\\nOnce data is stored, it can easily be retrieved using KYVE’s query interface or by accessing it directly in Arweave. KYVE’s validation and Arweave’s immutability, combined, guarantee data integrity towards downstream users.\\n\\n## What’s next?\\n\\nThe financing will allow us to refine our technology and infrastructure, improve the developer experience and strengthen our product offering. We are committed to building a product that our users need, love, and use. Now, we are looking forward to bringing new talent to help us integrate with additional Layer 1s and expand to Layer 2s, grow our community and move Web 3.0 forward.\\n\\nWe want to thank everyone who has supported us so far on our journey from idea to launch, especially during these times of uncertainty. The support from the community, our partners, and our investors has been outstanding, and we couldn’t have asked for better companions.\\n\\n## Want to get involved?\\n\\nJoin our [Telegram](https://t.me/kyvenet), [Discord](https://discord.gg/E73KZwaa4S), follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KYVEnetwork) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/kyve/) or write us an email at team\\\\@kyve.network.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1624885560,\"title\":\"Announcing our integrations with major blockchains and pre-seed round\",\"publication\":\"kyve\"},\"digest\":\"5TK-FwBXdJG4kZ7WXodwvZll0bk35uHZ1MaHWKMc73U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x72Ff7D1dF7D1e4B86886D68605f55ce42ef74624\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nmfIAr7ou7PPF9aOIAgFWflaV36biKUz-hFkJw_V7t8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"r0InKgCAqBvJuVBYR3zNNbJpAQqYgytadrJNVoIO95I\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0wB8C2257Nx6ZU-xYi3CphlHs8ClBopgAmGGhR_D9ed28x2sD5_IhzgCYWoMLJmW4Br6WWKYlD5i0KL4tXOyiQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeac8562eb019a9cda8b3208c8fd440bdfeadc9b0c940314089ab0cc4e09c75771e0e0320022633d5d64424d480cd272659ba97bcbef506374c3cb5a3192188c91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on kyve.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nmfIAr7ou7PPF9aOIAgFWflaV36biKUz-hFkJw_V7t8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"r0InKgCAqBvJuVBYR3zNNbJpAQqYgytadrJNVoIO95I\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"5TK-FwBXdJG4kZ7WXodwvZll0bk35uHZ1MaHWKMc73U\"}"
