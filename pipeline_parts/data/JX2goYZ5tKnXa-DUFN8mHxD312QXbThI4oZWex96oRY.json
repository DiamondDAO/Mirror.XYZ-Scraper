"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It is hard to find someone to listen to. First of all, everyone around us\\nis incredibly busy working and hustling. When we finally get\\nsomebody to lean on and try to express our feelings, it turns into a\\ncontest of who's suffering or feelings matter the most. \\n \\nMy parents used to do that a lot. I remember this incident where\\nonce an uncle who moved into the opposite house started speaking\\nto my dad and they started exchanging stories. The uncle was open\\nabout his past and he told my dad \\\"If you hear the stories from my\\npast..oh! I can't believe I've been through all that\\\" and my dad's\\nresponse was \\\"If you hear my stories of struggle, you'll hang yourself.\\nSuch horrible past.\\\" The uncle was shocked. \\n \\nWhen I asked him about this, his reply was \\\"talking about our\\nstruggles will help them feel better about their problems\\\". \\n \\nThis assumption is universal. A lot of us assume that talking about\\nour struggles as a response to someone who's sad would make them\\nfeel better. Not always. Emotional etiquette is an important skill for\\neveryone. Knowing when to use our feelings or struggles as an\\nexample is the key to becoming a good friend/partner, or a kind\\nstranger. \\n \\nWhen someone comes to you and wants to talk about anything - be\\nit the loss of a job or a breakup or loss of a loved one, the best thing\\nto do is listen. We can use our personal experience to tell the other\\nperson that they've come to the right place. It is an indication that\\nyou've been there and you know what it's like. A common ground for\\nyou both to connect. It should be 10% of the conversation. The rest\\nshould be about them. Listen, listen, and listen. The world needs\\nmore listeners. More than you think.\",\"timestamp\":1640664576,\"title\":\"#49 Learn Emotional Ettiquette\"},\"digest\":\"kkWTp64bstvZRKAe24EKdIqYYE1oYyYVO32kk7BUJ2Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5F882566e4B071Ec1565Ed633EDBFB5c902dCA74\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cb9ePrCFLZR-4NXgsAX4SZ5NyWgJMXzcxgUycfp34tg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-uJZlFRlIbA2bDe_0rg8P0-mJO7eZ8xwXzIYqo0klzw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"KZlvDFdeHRFeFo33ZRh80LYdf2o8CPCtdt86FNhg8PdTE7YKrMweBJc8cJndzcmRIFjslkZVjoTw3bNPkBl1QA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf271a1ca4c9bb25ddc14dfa515625cd77e5f6ed98214caf449f4d4fcb7b03ef276afdbef970f502d371f52647006f92654cbb3dd67c0ea60a9d0bc414bf44d471c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cb9ePrCFLZR-4NXgsAX4SZ5NyWgJMXzcxgUycfp34tg\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-uJZlFRlIbA2bDe_0rg8P0-mJO7eZ8xwXzIYqo0klzw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kkWTp64bstvZRKAe24EKdIqYYE1oYyYVO32kk7BUJ2Y\"}"
