"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Japan is indeed a very conservative country, but it is limited to people's customs and habits. They are not conservative about sex at all.\\n\\nMany people believe that Japan's sexual openness began slowly with the support of the United States after the war. In fact, Japan's cities had a mature and developed pornographic industry before they had full contact with the West. The rise of Japan's sex industry dates back to the Edo era. At that time, the shogunate did not regard sex as the opposite of Confucian ethics, but used it to maintain stability and promote authoritarian control of society. The shogunate policy led to the development of pornographic culture and consumption in Edo period to a certain extent. At that time, Edo had prosperous commerce, prosperous population and frequent population movements. As the substantive center of Japan, Edo gathers a large number of samurai, daimyo followers, other businessmen and civilians. So how to effectively manage these large numbers of bachelors without causing chaos? In 1617, the shogunate circled a piece of land in the northeast of Edo. The area called \\\"Jiyuan\\\" integrated various inns, theatres and brothels, becoming the first red light district with official acquiescence in Japan. Yoshihara's successful experience was soon popularized to Japan, and various spring selling places have also appeared in its cities: Kyoto, Osaka and Nagasaki. This is also the origin and embryonic period of Japanese spring selling culture!\\n\\nLater, with the local people's desire and demand for sex, Japanese painters began to be ready to make money, which inspired a large number of painters to create male and female love scene paintings. It reached its peak in the Edo era. This is the second important development stage of Japan's human nature opening up!\\n\\nIn addition, the Japanese accept sexual symbols more than any other country. According to the inquiry and analysis of relevant experts, the Japanese are far less sensitive to the concept of nudity than Westerners. Their wonderful nation will not imagine obscenity or even other because of nudity. So it seems that they are really a simple and wonderful nation. In the 16th century, it was recorded that the \\\"sea women\\\" in Japan at that time worked naked. Another example is the mixed bath of men and women. The mixed bath of father and daughter is still very popular in Japan. Although they are often covered by one or several pieces of shame cloth, it does not prevent them from sharing this beautiful bathing place with everyone.\\n\\nWith the further development of the economy, the pornographic industry has seized a lot of money for Japan, and the Japanese's openness to sex is at its peak. Sociologist John Gagnon pointed out in his works on sex and consumerism that \\\"in advanced industrial society, sexual desire will be directly related to consumer desire, and in some cases, the desire for things and the desire for sex are even the same.\\\" It is not difficult to understand that the more prosperous the consumer economy, the stronger the demand for sex.\\n\\nIn the twinkling of an eye, in 80s, the bubble economy in Japan suddenly broke down, and the pressure of life of the ordinary people was getting bigger and bigger. At that time, more and more young men and women were young. According to the Statistics Bureau of Japan's Ministry of general affairs, from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of single women among Japanese young people aged 25 to 29 increased from 20% to 48%, and the proportion of single men increased from 48.3% to 68%. Modern services customized for single men and women, such as love hotels, assistance, telephone clubs, have sprung up in big cities.\\n\\nJapan's overtime culture is also very popular now. Compared with some other countries, the pressure of Japanese young people is greater. After work, young people need to be vented due to the pressure of work. In the pursuit of sexual stimulation, AV is more explicit, more direct and exciting than any of its predecessors!\",\"timestamp\":1640276166,\"title\":\"Why is Japan so prosperous AV?\"},\"digest\":\"54QbEO0ETp9EO2KMnKz_rsWNNHzo5L2-c89w6ZU-q24\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEdcbD853d8A2661cBbfc1BA2D132DD3E1652Cc79\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7Y7oi5Q0Or2u5U5mRhtasfIrICWMSpJWMjvHYdQi4C8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8sXRX0UCE2kh0i4kXflUOohfPUcRAKEIpxKD7tUtODE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"DRTGaxiC1bWRLD3HK2DJRf5A5JQin_V_F6-nUvI7X-XCC7hcrJOugj0Ev1mtZ-HwfgfG5yEuCeQjJb05beGlAA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4ba116df2da30f8716874bad2dbc4df1562ba2df48e4020d36145fe8ac222c4c3cf716c17613e5a8a483163c5e9b5784b086db0d1022dabd5392b450954c05a31c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"7Y7oi5Q0Or2u5U5mRhtasfIrICWMSpJWMjvHYdQi4C8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8sXRX0UCE2kh0i4kXflUOohfPUcRAKEIpxKD7tUtODE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"54QbEO0ETp9EO2KMnKz_rsWNNHzo5L2-c89w6ZU-q24\"}"
