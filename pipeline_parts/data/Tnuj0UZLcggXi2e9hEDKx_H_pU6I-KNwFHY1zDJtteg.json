"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"### The Revolution of Business & Entrepreneurship\\n\\nIf you are reading this, you are part of the select few I have decided to share this project at genesis. I believe you will be a significant contributor into this DAO, and it‚Äôs beginnings. Let‚Äôs start reviewing why Glass exists and what will be our next steps.\\n\\n## Mission\\n\\nTL;DR: to help develop the Metaverse of tomorrow.\\n\\nGlass DAO is a decentralized community to explore emerging investment opportunities for digital real estate in the Metaverse. Its goal is to buy, develop and operate world-class venues for communities that drive high-value commercial impact. It achieves this goal through the collective participation of its community.\\n\\n### Glass DAO as a Social (Business) Token Gold Standard\\n\\nGlass DAO is an investment vehicle across the metaverse landscape.\\n\\nWe‚Äôre quickly seeing a surge in interests from the crypto community and traditional corporations creating their own platforms like Decentraland on mainnet and others like Sandbox closing their alpha season #1 not too long ago.\\n\\nThe goal of Glass DAO is to provide investment proposals on all types of digital real estate, regardless of what platform they are issued on or what token standard (like ERC721) they utilize.\\n\\nGlass DAO does not aim to support every platform, as the Metaverse will be large, rather the one‚Äôs making an impact as per the guidelines and principles outlined by the community (think of a set of criteria that will change depending on market sentiment).\\n\\nThe overarching goal of Glass is to better align and cement the criteria for NFTs that will held in the treasury, and to provide a means for coordination using token-based voting. Guiding principles of metaverse platforms listed on Glass today include but are not limited to:\\n\\n* Organic usage (Token holders on Decentraland, Sandbox, etc.)\\n* Utility outside of speculation (events currently happening?)\\n* Active participation from its users (what are people already building?)\\n* Self-amendable / Upgrading (does it improve its platform, and how often?)\\n* Volume\\n* Marketcap\\n\\nGlass DAO community lists projects on a case by case basis, and that the requirements today can include unique token holders, volume or market cap as the primary listing requirements. As this metaverse develops, however, the community will have to discover a new set of criteria for emerging worlds.\\n\\nThis is a living process. The community will be responsible for not just applying these criteria to new projects but for continuing to adapt the criteria over time.\\n\\nWith Glass tokens, the community should play an active role in deciding which digital properties (or NFTS) will be a part of the DAO treasury, and what minimum criteria (if any) should be met and maintained for those who apply. As there will also be a criteria to evaluate the NFT itself.\\n\\n* Square meters of NFT\\n* Location\\n* Neighbors\\n* Clean Land or Land with properties developed already\\n* Price\\n* Business Case\\n\\n## Enter $MVG\\n\\nIn the spirit of lean token design, the Glass DAO token (MVG) is being released as a highly modular token used to influence the investment vehicle.\\n\\nThe goal is to create an exchange-compatible token list (on Uniswap or Sushi swap) and allow contributors to earn a verification badge ‚úÖ by holding $MVG tokens in their wallet.\\n\\n### Glass DAO token holds no inherent value. It will launch with the sole use case of being used for business membership, governance and stake of the DAO treasury.\\n\\nOver time this process will become more decentralized, looking to tools like Gnosis and Snapshot to allow for off-chain governance of the $MVG token upgrades and investment proposals and other ideas to increase the value of the DAO.\\n\\nWe can envision a world in which $MVG is used to upgrade (‚Äúpromote‚Äú) a contributor/individual to a premium profile within the DAO. The more a person contributes to the DAO, the more tokens they will be receiving, hence increasing their reputation and stake within the community.\\n\\nWhile the first use to purchase digital real estate sets a benchmark for onboarding, it‚Äôs likely that Glass will be used for various other aspects, including but not limited to:\\n\\n* Commercial Real Estate Development\\n* Use of the Glass DAO‚Äôs treasury\\n* Premium profiles features\\n* Marketing & Design creation \\n\\nFuture use cases for $MVG will be voted in through governance.\\n\\n$MVG is being launched in the most minimal way possible, and will be distributed in a community-first fashion.\\n\\n### Token Distribution\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/MIoXHNwVqJKcV5xSi3Z_8.png?height=1080&width=1080)\\n\\nSupply: 13,000,000 $MVG\\n\\nContract Address: TBD\\n\\n### Community Treasury - 55%\\n\\nHeld in a 3/3 (for now) multisig wallet (via Gnosis-Safe) to be distributed at the community‚Äôs choosing. 10% unlocked at inception, remaining 90% vested over 18 months with monthly unlocks.\\n\\nThe original signers of the Glass DAO multisig are:\\n\\n* Mendy Berrebi (Founder of Glass DAO) - [@ilprinceps](https://twitter.com/ilprinceps)\\n* Avi David (aka Meditating Farmer) - [@AviDavid17](https://twitter.com/AviDavid17)\\n* Benjamin Sakhai (aka Benjamins) - [@BenjaminSakhai](https://twitter.com/BenjaminSakhai)\\n\\nThis initial set of signers will serve Yearly terms. This means that once per year, $MVG holders will vote to either keep or replace the existing signers.\\n\\nAll treasury tokens will be transferred using GlassDAO Snapshot proposals, with future ambitions to move to an on-chain DAO at the choosing of Glass holders.\\n\\nTreasury tokens are used at the discretion of the community, and may be allocated to any and all programs that add value to the Glass ecosystem.\\n\\n### Stakeholders - 25%\\n\\nDistributed to the founder, core team & contributors, partners and advisors who have contributed to Glass DAO. 10% of core team and contributors tokens are unlocked at inception, remaining 90% vested over 24 months with monthly unlocks.\\n\\nThe Stakeholders pool is broken down as follows:\\n\\n* **Founder** (12%) - 10% unlocked at inception - 6 months lockup - fully vested over 4 years with yearly unlocks\\n* **Core Team & Contributors** (8%) -  10% unlocked at inception - vested over 24 months, remaining 90% vested over 24 months with monthly unlocks - 3 months social lockup (4% options future allocations)\\n\\n  **Partners** - 3% - 6 months social lockup\\n* **Advisors** - 2.0% - 3 months social lockup\\n\\nFounder, Core Team & Contributors pool (20% \\\\* 13,000,000 = 2,600,000)\\n\\n* Mendy - 12% ($10,000 start) - Fully Vested 312,000\\n* Meditating Farmer - 3% ($2,500 start) - Fully Vested 78,000\\n* Benjamins - 3% - ($2,500 start) - Fully Vested 78,000\\n* Berrebask - 1% - ($833.33 start) - Fully Vested 26,000\\n* Cryptodose - .05% ($420 start) - Fully Vested 13,000\\n* Plisza (Benjamin Sebban) - .05% ($420 start) - Fully Vested 13,000\\n\\nThis will give us \\\\~$16,500 worth to begin genesis treasury and start buying our first digital piece of land with minimal risk. \\n\\n### Retroactive Airdrop - 20%\\n\\nThe entirety of the 13,000,000 $MVG supply will be minted to the Glass Treasury. From there, the 20% MVG tokens (2,600,000 $MVG) will be distributed based on increasing ‚Äúmilestones‚Äù, as shown below to the following groups:\\n\\n* **Ops/Marketing/Gov/BizDev:** proportional to the value of their contributions, as approved by the DAO, potentially using tools such as [SourceCred](https://sourcecred.io/).\\n* Coming Soon:\\n  * **Entrepreneurs/Builders:** proportional to revenue generated by their products\\n  * **Buyers/Investors:** proportional to dollars invested on Digital Real Estate acquired\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1640184624,\"title\":\"Announcing Glass DAO üèÅ\"},\"digest\":\"DKmjw2kK6gNn5ekKJTyPYFApzHQkJ3BK0TYenjIPIHg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc7f7fAD0A723f648f052E60B7b8E007dCB85979A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Uphe4yyU6KoqVcWuRKMiIHnPe3saIjnh1u6szfK9xfU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bDMnxWb8PPaoV3KJUmRIDQZZiWzX1BU5iMKGK7c1meI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TPIMwJBRS8cwLMHM-jla-wtqGh_w7MHWCDBRTxfC1inwUNAbmgHKkqVkpAwHdoxggOHyMi8VpVFVwNQWDGdVkw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf3536575017b7b405964fe3241c5ddaf3cf4ad41d995f2d017cc73c7136357e649fd9813e3f7f55e4fcfd85d0075e21ea161d7bc29db67124f180693cc606f191c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Uphe4yyU6KoqVcWuRKMiIHnPe3saIjnh1u6szfK9xfU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bDMnxWb8PPaoV3KJUmRIDQZZiWzX1BU5iMKGK7c1meI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"DKmjw2kK6gNn5ekKJTyPYFApzHQkJ3BK0TYenjIPIHg\"}"
