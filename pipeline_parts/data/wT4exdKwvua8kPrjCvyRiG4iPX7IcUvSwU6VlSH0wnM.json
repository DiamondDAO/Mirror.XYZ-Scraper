"{\"content\":{\"body\":\" \\n \\n\\nIn 2008, I had a year left at University and I plopped $10 into BTC. I don’t recall the exact price, but there was almost a thousand BTC for the price. Someone else had bought pizza with it and I remember scoffing at the waste of the potential, knowing that someone is going to remember that they digested pizza that is worth the retirement of a small office. After a long day of studying, I allowed iTunes to update its software, while I took a much needed break. When I returned over 1500 tracks of music that I had burned onto my hard drive were gone. There were a few songs that were downloaded from BitTorrent, but for the most part, I had not “pirated” a lot of music, because I was concerned with PC security, and artist rights. Two years prior, my CD collection was stolen out of my car with my aftermarket CD player. All of my music data had been wiped clean. Trigger Warning: The violation I felt was intense…it was like my hard drive had been raped. I don’t remember the time frame exactly, but very closely timed with that update, my digital wallet was hacked and stolen. I blamed Apple and vowed to never use their products again. I told everyone I know about the event, if they even think of giving me a hard time as to why I am an Android user and not Apple. I LOATHE APPLE with the core of my being, because of the assault on my hard drive. I cursed whoever stole my BTC that they would die a slow and painful death; I knew that it would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, despite the naysayers at the time. The lack of transparency from Apple and the electronic violation hurt my interest in crypto for many years. \\n\\nIn 2017, I was trying to get back in the crypto game again, but my budget was super tight from a divorce and alimony. I was trading on CBOE, GDAX and Binance. I was living alone with custody of my daughter 50% of the time and trying to date with a thin schedule. In hindsight, I probably should have invested in more counselling, for both my mental health and financial portfolio. There were weird phishing emails, harassing phone calls and even a letter mailed to my address telling me that I was engaging in illegal activity. As a licensed professional, that did not sit well with me. I follow the rules of society and I contribute in a meaningful way with my career, so I have no desire to mess that up.  I got really scared. I don’t want to have to explain myself every time I go to renew my license! CBOE and GDAX shut down so I moved everything to Binance and then I was locked out due to my US location.  \\n\\n I had bought 0.5 ETH for like $140 in 2017, and October 2021 when ETH is trading at $4800, I was lamenting the ‘lost’ coin given its valuation. I randomly checked in and I was given a 7 day window to withdraw my funds from Binance and move it to Binance.US. YAY, I get to keep my coins! I have recently found farming, pooling and staking coins in DeFi products and I am looking forward to watching my portfolio grow. \\n\\nI have had so many people around me, not in tech, blow it off, or put me down like I’m naïve and have ‘the wool pulled over my eyes,’ but I have always known this is the future. In 2017, when I didn’t have a lot of cash lying around to invest, I told my friends and family around me, that had more disposable income, hoping they would capitalize on the tip…NOPE. It’s funny how those haters are still NOT in the game,despite massive gains in BTC and ETH. But at least I’ve levelled up from ‘silly, wishful thinking’ to ‘on to something.’\\n\\nMy current job is to constantly assess, collaborate vertically and horizontally to make a plan that best suits all stakeholders, execute the plan, report any variances and differences while executing said plan, communicate and document the process, all while assessing and gathering new data at regular, and as needed intervals, based on the trends I see occurring. I have latitude and high degree of control of how the process is implemented, which checks off many boxes of satisfaction for me. I have always wanted to change the world. And in my career, I impact the lives of others dramatically, but I don’t reach a large audience at any given time.\\n\\nWeb3 is revolutionizing the system, and giving back power to the people to control their future, by controlling their wallets and finances. Many people are still scared and haven’t jumped in the crypto space because they would rather feel safe, than to be  free. \\n\\nI’ve had some hiccups, got scared, lost faith in the cause for a while, stopped and started again…so, it’s been a journey, for sure. But, one that I am grateful for, I have learned a lot and I look forward to learning and growing even more. There are so many possibilities. \\n\\nI have so many ideas and I look forward to learning new things and meeting new people  that share similar hopes and dreams for the future of our world. To be fair, I’m not a computer genius, but I can see trends and applications pretty early on. I think big and I think out-of-the-box. I can see the bigger picture of things from a cruising altitude. I know there is work to be done on the ground, but I don’t always know where to start or who to talk to. Maybe that’s why I’m here…now.  \",\"timestamp\":1638582499,\"title\":\"My crypto journey...\"},\"digest\":\"m0i3cmG7MuecM1vip2TjM5XcN8tJa7XMQukvsmeGzyA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD7B1D6bfe1774206DC7cdf37D74B28c29f92DdCD\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FmDxRftmtkyjze7jjJH0pCV-g24e7ijIv62EWS_Yppc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"51cXwcCRLyLmfUl7dMtX2rBc5676vSLYIt8oUljvP5U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"XB14ZB5Qv019wmCAnHrQCVIP4t6uFux7lV__XLVNgU3CN_EtOKeP2KEPXQf2u4g0RUd9V7nT6BJUVXlq_mQNHw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe3e80e3f2cef209b492b624e3a7419fa6f3452a20d69126725a29d2512c3b398237e02c996fb3e4f5221a81d121f7152afe7ef069f366a92a35363cf9e2372ca1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FmDxRftmtkyjze7jjJH0pCV-g24e7ijIv62EWS_Yppc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"51cXwcCRLyLmfUl7dMtX2rBc5676vSLYIt8oUljvP5U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"m0i3cmG7MuecM1vip2TjM5XcN8tJa7XMQukvsmeGzyA\"}"
