"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"> Last Updated: 12/8/2021 @ 8:55am (MST).\\n\\n## üëã Welcome to Building Together\\n\\n> As I dive deeper into web3, what gets me the most excited is being apart of a larger community, having direct access to founders trying to build, and the leveling of opportunity that emerging dapps, defi and DAOs can provide. And thus, the series *Building Together* will look to feature projects I am an invested community member of (time or money) in which I will do my part to drive innovation forward through personal suggestions and community recaps.\\n\\nAs such, I present, *Building Together: Mazury (üåä,üåä)* featuring [Mazury](https://mazurylabs.com) built by [wojtek.eth](https://app.mazurylabs.com/people/0xF417ACe7b13c0ef4fcb5548390a450A4B75D3eB3). If you‚Äôre not familiar with the recently launched web3 professional social graph, I‚Äôd highly recommend getting up to speedüëá\\n\\n## ü§î What is Mazury (üåä,üåä)?\\n\\nGlad you asked! Mazury is a decentralized professional reputation dapp that aims to improve discoverability and signaling of web3 expertise by showcasing your on-chain activity. The dapp did a soft launch on December 1st to begin on-boarding community members and ultimately build out the product in a public community forum. Building in public is a very daunting task and I applaud the team for taking the leap to build this product hand in hand with the community that will leverage it.\\n\\n> [Website](https://mazurylabs.com)\\n>\\n> [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mazurylabs)\\n>\\n> [Discord](https://discord.gg/g66qSF956K)\\n\\nThe founder, [wojtek.eth](https://app.mazurylabs.com/people/0xF417ACe7b13c0ef4fcb5548390a450A4B75D3eB3), has put out two mirror posts around the launch and released a hands on product demo that will provide more context as to the vision of Mazury from the founder himself:\\n\\n> <https://mirror.xyz/wojtek.eth/RC0dhwl_x0llZMw3bkt06zLcN8-YG_rJNsQ_byv03-Y>\\n\\n> <https://mirror.xyz/wojtek.eth/nxxwl2AL98foNND2vsnBL8ntxV0fjzRGnAZJO5PweVQ>\\n\\n## üèÉ Onboarding + Initial Thoughts\\n\\nMy experience onboarding was extremely smooth connecting through a MetaMask wallet, just a few clicks to connect and my profile was set-up. Mazury connected my profile to my ENS reverse registrar (pucker.eth). I filled in the rest of the profile and voil√†!\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/E48XcsKFqG023S-6z8xgW.png?height=1432&width=1676)\\n\\nIn the current form of the product, I see three main forms of building your web3 reputation:\\n\\n* Badges\\n  * The badges signal your on-chain accomplishments across different web3 products. Signaling everything from being an ‚ÄòMazury Early Adopter‚Äô to being a verified ‚ÄòSushi Voter‚Äô.\\n* Community Referrals\\n  * The community referrals act as you would suspect. A member of Mazury can refer others to show their support of another community member‚Äôs work, professionalism, or community engagement.\\n* POAPs\\n  * Additionally, you can showcase your POAPs for taking part in a supported web3 activity.\\n\\nThe product definitely has a lot of developer use cases in the current form with the ability to merge your web2 github experience to your on-chain reputation and earn subsequent badges for you commits and expertise across the different programming languages.\\n\\n## üóÇ Professional Web2 Certifications?\\n\\nAs the project develops further, my personal wish list to kick start **my** own web3 identify would be a web2 integration for my action based certification within the marketing world, specifically from Google.\\n\\nFor example, I am always keeping up to date on my [Google Ads Certifications](https://skillshop.exceedlms.com/student/catalog/list?category_ids=2844-google-ads-certifications) and showcase these on my [LI](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerhutten/) profile. I would love to be able to showcase my web2 certification on my Mazury profile as they are highly relevant actions that signal my expertise and foundational knowledge.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/59h1sr_ht_AWL5sSNftp0.png?height=1364&width=1302)\\n\\n**üëá**\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l9-o7eIn8p6P5vRNuudqh.jpg?height=1080&width=1920)\\n\\nI am ecstatic to do my part in making Mazury a success. I will see you for the next update as the team continues to roll-out new features.\\n\\nCheers!\\n\\n\\\\-Tyler Hutten ‚Ä¢ pucker.eth\\n\\n**disclaimer**: The Mazury team did not contribute to this post. @Mazury team, if you think I missed the mark somewhere in representing the project, I can be found atüëá.\\n\\n[https://y.at/ü§ØüèíüéÆüñº](https://y.at/%F0%9F%A4%AF%F0%9F%8F%92%F0%9F%8E%AE%F0%9F%96%BC)\",\"timestamp\":1639004187,\"title\":\"Building Together: Mazury (üåä,üåä) #0\"},\"digest\":\"iHCX2tGWoFQjET-cCMj2E_PPOrCLeupqsxl4VvdNChA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x629B174bC7cBCCD97bE125c770F7D582A5910353\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6-YDtk_zoH8X4Q_gdk_sq4nc_ttzQbZtO-tA99Xu9lY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dfLSNgLu6zHttH4S-TrIaUm2wgYAPjrzi8hnPBCTvmA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"CBcBmd3yLXWzA413OHSpLEjVmEbxIV5cf-UOY1UL1Z-mZ6-30yfpuRvBrPk9jDDB8xgrcKlFicoq9r9W9EegaQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb5432807fbd663c59d68d45044df8e38cdfb0dcd9a773ff73dcefacbd083c5b07a81b3082a2b507221680653bd8b2e0ce9b00971b2d0a483977839bc3262d3361c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"6-YDtk_zoH8X4Q_gdk_sq4nc_ttzQbZtO-tA99Xu9lY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"dfLSNgLu6zHttH4S-TrIaUm2wgYAPjrzi8hnPBCTvmA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Dvltqbm7Q715zvXpULThdfYUsyu8hxtDfhoqkHTkuwQ\"}"
