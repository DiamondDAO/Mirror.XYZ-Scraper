My name is Imperfect and I am a 23 years old french NFT artist on foundation.app since November 24, 2021 only. I had the great opportunity to be spotted by [@Keepcase](https://twitter.com/Keepcase) aka Erin through one of my followers on Instagram who is also my friend now ([@Emaniak_NFT](https://twitter.com/Emaniak_NFT)).\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Emaniak_NFT/status/1460176381149655045?s=20](https://twitter.com/Emaniak_NFT/status/1460176381149655045?s=20)\\n\\nThanks to this unexpected opportunity in just two weeks I met a world I had never seen before and people so humanly true who accept me directly as I was without judging myself.\\n\\nI never thought I would be qualified to sell NFTs and write my first article on the web 3.0, but since November 15, 2021, everything went very fast for me who was until then an order picker in Amazon warehouses. But it’s all right! I took my leave today until Christmas to try to become a real NFT artist for 2 weeks and then see what happens.\\n\\n## I - Introduction to my third painting, “a Girl Named Candy”\\n\\nLet me introduce you ***a Girl Named Candy***, a painting inspired by the tales of the Brothers Grimm’s with a touch of Shakespearean tragedy and poetry, realized by myself on December 7, 2021.\\n\\n![a Girl Named Candy, made by imperfect.jpeg](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/LzunP_RJgJrmREsC2eOKk.jpg?height=5000&width=4000)\\n\\nThrough this painting, I try to immerse you in the 1930s-1940s, the golden age of Hollywood cinema.\\n\\nA half-lit night scene with a calm and tense atmosphere… almost dangerous? The Candy Bar is always open and we can easily distinguish two characters with frozen postures,\\n\\n* a mysterious man reading the newspaper\\n* and a woman with the gaze lost in the void surrounded by sweetness.\\n\\nWhat’s going on in this bar-pastry ? The poem available with the painting will tell us.\\n\\n## 1/4 - The tragic story of Lady Candy\\n\\nPossessing as much passion as colors on my palette, and approaching Christmas, I wanted to tell the famous story of Candy through a childish poem reminding us of fairy tales and Christmas movies with a tragic ending that makes us doubt Candy’s wishes in front of the fairy Mandy.\\n\\n* 📖 I invite you first to **read the story in this written version.**\\n* 🎙️ Then **listened to his audio version** created with a smart voice and FL Studio by myself.\\n* 🧚‍♀️ **And at the very end, if you had one wish, what would you have chosen ?**\\n\\n*(reply me on the tweet, it’s super interesting, I would tell you my wishes at the end of the presentation)*\\n\\n## Written version\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nB1HZiAVC3P_Si3wpULZ7.gif?height=200&width=356)\\n\\n*a Girl Named Candy,*\\n\\n*Once upon a time was a girl named Candy\\nSweet as a flower and loved all so much.\\nShe was granted a wish by a fairy named Mandy\\nthat turned into candy all that she touched.*\\n\\n*The town was filled with the sweets of Candy\\nthe rocks and the houses and bicycles too.\\nCandy would say that the world was just dandy!\\nparading the streets in her candy suede shoes.*\\n\\n*But everything ends and also for Candy\\nwhen all that she touched would turn into sweets.\\nRealising a candy-lover's not handy\\nshe walked alone on candy-cobbled streets.*\\n\\n*And loneliness came like a night over Candy\\ncrying skittles she soon went insane.\\nShe cursed the wish she was granted by Mandy\\nas she crumbled and cracked like a candy cane.*\\n\\n*For the rest of the year the children ate candy\\nthe rocks and the houses and bicycles too.\\nThe children would say that the world was just dandy\\nand the last sweet they shared was a candy suede shoe.*\\n\\n*Written by imperfect.jpeg,*\\n\\n### Audio Version\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPgk-CHqtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRPgk-CHqtw)\\n\\n## 2/4 - The scene in 3 details\\n\\n### #1 - The Woman with Golden Curls\\n\\n![Lady Candy](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ftCRy9i0l18qfZ_-58L_c.jpg?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\nAmong the two characters, the one that we notice directly with her look of Maryline Monroe, can only be Lady Candy. Worried about the wish she has just realized with Mandy. In her thoughts, the gaze pointing to the emptiness of loneliness. She looks so far away wearing her beautiful red dress that she forgets to eat the cakes, and sweets all around.\\n\\nThe blond hair fits perfectly with the warm tones of the bar and the surrounding architecture but this will not help to receive a gentleman at the table tonight, under the risk of turning him into a candy.\\n\\n### #2 - The Unknown Gentleman\\n\\n![The man with the newspaper](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/DbVbbV3qj1HFSO9Xr1e7n.jpg?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\nHe’s definitely the most mysterious character in the painting. Showing no expression in the face, it is impossible to capture his real intentions. Pensive too, he holds in hand what seems to be the newspaper of California Coffee.\\n\\nWhat is he really waiting for ? So late at night, alone and leaning on his chair, he stays away from Candy, but it feels like he’s waiting for the right moment to hurt her.\\n\\n### #3 - Unreal pastry and an empty plate\\n\\n![Last birthday cakes](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/pGs3uMFepHCpLwdjMJ-db.jpg?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\nIf the atmosphere seems heavy, the table of Candy seems more than delicious ! Everything is so colorful, soft, smooth, nothing exceeds !\\n\\nExcept for one detail, not necessarily visible at first glance, but this cake lets us imagine that Candy is celebrating her last birthday today all alone on a table with two plates. Unfortunately it seems that no one will come…\\n\\n![Nobody’s plate](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/XOQwQIsBTQXWEIaqQFUYP.jpg?height=1000&width=1000)\\n\\n## 3/4 - The stages of creation\\n\\nTo tell you the truth, when I first started working on this painting, I would never have believed that it would have required so much patience and time.\\n\\n![Creation Summary](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tiBt5FrD-yEGg-hnPC1zi.jpg?height=768&width=2167)\\n\\nAn arm wrestle between passion and nerves, I had to stay awake 3 nights to propose master realism and hours of concentration and fun to make all these cakes and fruit worthy of the anime Food War.\\n\\n![Yukihira Soma - Food War (written by Yūto Tsukuda and drawn by Shun Saeki)](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/c8Mu_j7s_9B1LMWNSqq62.gif?height=304&width=540)\\n\\n### #1 - STEP 1\\n\\n![SKETCHING + COLOUR PALETTE](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/lFIhkL3TsMGYVBRTKocnR.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\n### #2 - STEP 2\\n\\n![AMOSPHERES & BACKGROUND + FOREGROUND](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/kDHrATXhCu79EQrAFU7xz.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\n### #3 - LAST STEP\\n\\n![PAINTING THE CHARACTERS AND THE BACKGROUND](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/IGsJzoEx0VOmxs9Yuf1gM.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\n## 4/4 - A first auction and a new adventure\\n\\n***a Girl Named Candy***, is now available on Foundation waiting for a first auction and a new gallery where her vintage beauty and her tragic fairy tale will be welcomed.\\n\\nHoping you enjoyed my first concept presentation article, I would love to have your advice because I remain a noob in NFT and I want to take this chance after a life of disappointments and failures.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/115052](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/115052)\\n\\n## II - MY ROADMAP AND WISHES\\n\\nI tell you this live at the same time I write, I thought about it and I convinced myself to leave Jeff Bezos and his warehouse on December 31, 2021 and started 2022 in Yes Man as Jim Carrey. Thanks to all the people who have read so far, despite the poor quality of the post, I took a huge pleasure in writing it. I was able to describe my creation as I wished and I was able to speak completely freely without fear of being judged. Damn it, it makes me feel so good, I want to do it again every week !\\n\\n**“Wonder”, Painting realized in a few hours on October 25, 2021**\\n\\nLet me quickly introduce you to Wounder and quote his description that I had done on October 25, 2021 on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CVcKnkisLEY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) long before I started selling NFTs on Foundation.\\n\\n![Wonder, made by impefect.jpeg](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/us8W3sv-vDbSCFLgInQic.jpg?height=3000&width=3000)\\n\\n> *“Since childhood, I have always been amazed by a lot of things until I am obsessed with them and lose sight of everything that surrounds me. Still today at 23 years old, I still have these same children’s eyes in front of all the new things that happen to my life but unfortunately it does not bring me only positive today this kind of behavior.” -* Wonder, October 25, 2021\\n\\nThese children’s eyes that I still have today face to the possibility of finally being free and dragging with me my whole family and community on a new adventure. If I have to spend nights writing an article that maybe only 10 people will read and 2 will enjoy, I will do it all day, but I would also need your support to get there. ✊\\n\\n## MY ROADMAP\\n\\n* 🌻 ALL MY NFTS WILL BE LISTED AT **0.20 ETH**\\n* 🌼 SUBMIT **3-4 ARTWORK PER MONTH**\\n* 🖼 LIST A PAINTING **ONLY IF THE PREVIOUS ONE IS SOLD**\\n* 🎁 OFFER A 1/1 FRAMEWORK TO THE COMMUNITY OR TO THE FIRST OWNER OF THE NFTS\\n* ✍ Write an article on the subject that fascinates me every weekend as painting, philosophy, society, psychology or even music etc...\\n* 💛 Help the community as much as possible by buying artwork from talented artists that starts, and create early concept projects to help people in need such as charitable collection\\n\\nIn order to fulfill my commitments, I need you and your support.
