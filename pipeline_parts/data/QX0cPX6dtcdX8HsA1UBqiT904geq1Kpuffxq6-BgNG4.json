The Author thought them\\nconsiderable enough to address them to his Prince; whom he paints with all\\nthe great and good qualities of a Monarch, upon whom the Romans depended\\nfor the Increase of an Absolute Empire.  But to make the Poem entirely\\nEnglish, I was willing to add one or two of those which contribute to the\\nHappiness of a Free People, and are more consistent with the Welfare of our\\nNeighbours.\\n\\nThis Epistle will show the learned World to have fallen into Two mistakes:\\none, that Augustus was a Patron of Poets in general; whereas he not only\\nprohibited all but the Best Writers to name him, but recommended that Care\\neven to the Civil Magistrate:  Admonebat Praetores, ne paterentur Nomen\\nsuum obsolefieri, etc.  The other, that this Piece was only a general\\nDiscourse of Poetry; whereas it was an Apology for the Poets, in order to\\nrender Augustus more their Patron.  Horace here pleads the Cause of his\\nContemporaries, first against the Taste of the Town, whose humour it was to\\nmagnify the Authors of the preceding Age; secondly against the Court and\\nNobility, who encouraged only the Writers for the Theatre; and lastly\\nagainst the Emperor himself, who had conceived them of little Use to the\\nGovernment.  He shows (by a View of the Progress of Learning, and the\\nChange of Taste among the Romans) that the Introduction of the Polite Arts\\nof Greece had given the Writers of his Time great advantages over their\\nPredecessors; that their Morals were much improved, and the Licence of\\nthose ancient Poets restrained:  that Satire and Comedy were become more\\njust and useful; that, whatever extravagances were left on the Stage, were\\nowing to the Ill Taste of the Nobility; that Poets, under due Regulations,\\nwere in many respects useful to the State, and concludes, that it was upon\\nthem the Emperor himself must depend for his Fame with Posterity.\\n\\nWe may farther learn from this Epistle, that Horace made his Court to this\\ngreat Prince by writing with a decent Freedom toward him, with a just\\nContempt of his low Flatterers, and with a manly Regard to his own\\nCharacter.  P.\\n\\nEPISTLE I.\\n\\nTO AUGUSTUS.\\n\\nWhile you, great patron of mankind! sustain\\nThe balanced world, and open all the main;\\nYour country, chief, in arms abroad defend,\\nAt home, with morals, arts, and laws amend;\\nHow shall the muse from such a monarch, steal\\nAn hour, and not defraud the public weal?\\nEdward and Henry, now the boast of fame,\\nAnd virtuous Alfred, a more sacred

the sayings of old Ben?\\nIn all debates where Critics bears a part,\\nNot one but nods, and talks of Jonson's art,\\nOf Shakespeare's nature, and of Cowley's wit;\\nHow Beaumont's judgment checked what Fletcher writ;\\nHow Shadwell hasty, Wycherley was slow;\\nBut for the passions, Southern sure and Rowe.\\nThese, only these, support the crowded stage,\\nFrom eldest Heywood down to Cibber's
