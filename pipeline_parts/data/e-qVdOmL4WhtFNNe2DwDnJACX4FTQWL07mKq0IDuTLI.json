I want to spend energy on the things I’m best at, but some of those things feel undervalued. This piece is an introduction, a question, and a coagulation of big feelings that have sat with me for a loooong time.\\n\\n**Please watch before reading on:**\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk](https://youtu.be/a7MiAVMkDyk)\\n\\n**I started creating I NEED A JOB in 2015 and finished it in September 2021.**\\n\\nIt’s tried on a lot of different outfits from then to now but I think it’s finally found colors that suit it. I’m happy to feel this idea captured in a tangible way.\\n\\n**Is this one of my jobs?**\\n\\nI have/had many jobs. I think I’ll always have many “jobs” at once according to various interests, abilities, and context.\\n\\nCreating is a job I take very seriously - despite rarely getting paid for it.  However, the process of becoming a paid artist in the music platform/social media era has always felt a bit unnatural to me.\\n\\nI shared some thoughts with my friends/collaborators in the [songcamp](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/) community that I think are relevant here:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ppuNlAxPV5vVclNxWohbg.png?height=1314&width=1354)\\n\\n**To those of you who belong to the communities I frequent, or the web3 creative community as a whole:**\\n\\nI NEED A JOB ties together feelings that have been in me and (I think) a lot of us as we begin to accept a reality where finding work that aligns with our personal strengths/passions may be the most logical, most valuable, and best compensated action one could take (both for ourselves and our communities). Use it if it helps, and compensate it if you think it should be compensated.\\n\\nWill :0)\",\"timestamp\":1635400959,\"title\":\"I NEED A JOB.\",\"publication\":\"willjuergens\"},\"digest\":\"XZrmy0shH0MXzx4ZhGLyZeoeSjNLdILzUXRRhdDJB3Y\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4786cDa66e176173568Ce26343135543A3F04cB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v-_ht87xRmkwiTGZi-M7g5nIfn7vsTU44gto_mCRaWM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1fN2A3cytNJzVqEun_1rLhEZL4V_jOO2JvueGx49g\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"9I3rcql0atDkQ8T7z9SPK_yMXMpySWT9PnQW729B5ebPYJaGMX7w_eUreie_6LIdZ5DCNpxSuszzDvYhijj0Yg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6993da8e2f231f82d715858a009680b3b03764fbe68711f7e09b95595be4e5e27cae3201c0e93b3efa20bff9bd9ed6bfce3589d50fd36b425731ed64f0779cd71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"v-_ht87xRmkwiTGZi-M7g5nIfn7vsTU44gto_mCRaWM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mC1fN2A3cytNJzVqEun_1rLhEZL4V_jOO2JvueGx49g\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Iop1K9RENJB7aBpHh_GecojhTLllnP8sAC2DEv-hrEk\"}"
