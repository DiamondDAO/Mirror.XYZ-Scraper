Models of some modern railway constructions in the African continent are also on display in the Nairobi Railway Museum as a way of preserving the present for the future](http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202110/05/615bb641a310cdd3d81145ad.jpeg)\\n\\nSitting at the heart of Nairobi's central business district, the Nairobi Railway Museum could be considered as one of Kenya's best gems hidden in plain sight. Tucked away on Station Road at Nairobi Railway Station's northwest end, the little known museum is a repository of past events in the region.\\n\\nOne can hardly talk about the history of East Africa without talking about the development of the railway in the region. In as far as this is true, the Nairobi Railway Museum stands as one of the best documentations of East Africa's history.\\n\\nThe museum contains exhibits from the now defunct East African Railways and was opened in 1971 by East African Railways and Harbours Corporation.\\n\\nLocated at the heart of the city and currently being operated by Kenya Railways Corporation, the museum preserves the relics of the railways of East Africa and serves as a center of learning on the rail travel history in this vast region.\\n\\nElias Randiga, the museum's curator, says that the museum receives around 7,000 visitors annually, mostly foreigners. However, the COVID-19 outbreak and resultant restrictions have reduced the numbers significantly.\\n\\nDespite the slowdown in the number of visitors, the museum remains a fascinating introduction to an important piece of the colonial history of East Africa. It narrates the tale of the railway's construction through the whole stretch of the period from the annexation of the region in the 1800s as a British protectorate, to the struggles for freedom and independence.\\n\\nThe museum has two sections that display items that seem to have been frozen in time. The main gallery contains an array of well-preserved relics from over a century ago including numerous records and artifacts of the railway's construction and operation.\\n\\nOn display are also items such as lampposts, station benches and oddities from the East African Railways stations from both Kenya and Uganda.\\n\\nOne such item is a bicycle that was introduced by the administration in the 1950s to inspect the line. The peculiar bicycle was a revolutionary invention by East Africa Railways that replaced the inspection push trolley that was manual and involved up to four operators.\\n\\nA bicycle used for inspections on the railway line is on display at the Nairobi Railway Museum. The use of a bicycle to inspect rail defects was invented by East Africa Railways. \\n\\n**Time stands still**\\n\\nIn this museum where time seems to have stood still for decades, the story of the struggles involved in building the railway line from the port of Mombasa into the Ugandan heartland is well preserved. One such story that has fascinated the whole world is the story of the man-eating lions of Tsavo that almost brought the railway construction to a standstill.\\n\\nAfter leaving Mombasa, the rail had to cross the Tsavo Plain. As the line progressed, man-eating lions held up the construction. They attacked the construction camp and killed several workers.\\n\\n\\\"Charles Ryall, a colonial engineer and administrator was dragged to his death at Kima Station on June 6, 1900, by these marauding lions. He intended to lure the lion into a carriage with the aim of killing it,\\\" Randiga explains.\\n\\n\\\"He had stationed lookouts at the back of the carriage and left the door and windows ajar. Unfortunately, they all fell asleep and did not hear the lion enter the carriage and drag Ryall to his death.\\\"\\n\\nThe Kenya-Uganda railway line, which was nicknamed the Lunatic Express by its British constructors because of its high cost and the dangers faced by those constructing it, is believed to have cost more than 2,500 lives through tropical diseases, murderous heat, and the man-eating lions. Randiga says that it is estimated that four workers died for each mile of the 931-kilometer railway line.\\n\\nAnother important bit of East African history captured at the Nairobi Railway Museum is the arrival of Asians, especially Indians in East Africa. Most of the skilled and unskilled labor used in the construction of the railway line was imported from India and many of them remained after their contracts ended. This marked the establishment of the Asian community in Uganda and Kenya which thrives to this day.\",\"timestamp\":1636626566,\"title\":\"Museum freezes East Africa's railway history\"},\"digest\":\"rLMzM9oailrpXXf6Tuk73U0IGFLVz_66bs8_hnzRFO4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7dB175eeF2c0bC68e577d9FEb22893f14E395A31\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CpEwB52daxvsBKn9wMaYjImnbybxn6D8pEzDMq2V2ZM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wq_Ao7gU9OdpyKIh_jbIXX6qayVFyu1pWuc__oyINgw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FbC_ZPYVA7FTY4uTIvFGBaw__3bw7FUluJYGmtzmKswRvU3RIJrL2SzdKgKn40x3ob58X4Im8C51UgDPOshTpg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe90e8d32b1a115eb0da44340b351d06ba39eda08ebe2c8b4cdd847fbe90b13e1476bb6af7847ac7eea9502ded76262eec5a1b103c001de6ccf40256c9aca045d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"CpEwB52daxvsBKn9wMaYjImnbybxn6D8pEzDMq2V2ZM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"wq_Ao7gU9OdpyKIh_jbIXX6qayVFyu1pWuc__oyINgw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rLMzM9oailrpXXf6Tuk73U0IGFLVz_66bs8_hnzRFO4\"}"
