"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I'll start by talking about what the mainstream DEX are now. \\n\\nThe first is Uniswap, the leading DEX, with the largest number of users and the largest variety of tokens, with over 6,000 tokens available for users to trade on its regular and specialized exchanges.Uniswap charges a 0.3% fee for exchanging tokens and deposits the fee in a liquid pool. There is currently no agreed fee, but a 0.05% fee will be charged in the future. High gas, with slippage, NO MEV-resistance. so Uniswap is suitable for opening trading of new coins, not for daily trading of mainstream coins.\\n\\n The second one is SushiSwap, which has about 1600 tokens available for trading on its platform, with a small number of new coins for opening trading. Like Uniswap, SushiSwap charges a fixed fee of 0.3% on exchange transactions, has high gas, has slippage, and is MEV-resistant, and like Uniswap, is suitable for new coin openings but not for daily trading in mainstream coins. \\n\\nThe third one is 1inch. 1inch stands out mainly because it is a DEX trading aggregator. Essentially, it grabs other exchanges that automatically offer users the cheapest prices, and reschedules user transactions by offering the exchange with the best price and total fees for the transactions they want to make. Its biggest advantage is that it supports pending orders, so it is suitable for those users who prefer to trade pending orders.\\n\\nThe fourth one is the not-yet-disbursed DEX, Hashflow, which currently supports only 11 mainstream trading pairs and will soon open a public pool. Unlike other DEX direct airdrop tokens, Hashflow adds NFT as a means of reward and empowers NFT, creating the conditions for a fun and diverse DEX. It has the advantages of lowest gas, Tighter spreads, Zero slippage, and MEV-resistance. It is especially suitable for daily trading of large amounts and high frequency (at this stage only for mainstream coins). The most surprising thing is that you can now get NFT bonus and weekly trading mining bonus for trading, which can satisfy your trading needs and also get $HFT token bonus, why not? In the near future, it will also support multi-chain, cross-chain, option and futures business, it is a very promising DEX, and also very focused on community governance. If you use it once, you'll always love it! trust me,haha\\\\~\",\"timestamp\":1642170924,\"title\":\"Which DEX is best for you?\"},\"digest\":\"OF0W2gl_VQmouSeyvR2e4B_XuDEhs8GNDJES-_tua0s\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4abDF782327d3447f614525C842571E8172ce5a9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u3Pqz9LpMORJTgHXuQM2wimc9N_7uGptOPjnDPI-hOM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8KFob14RseaNcOuhSSu2FFVNhJHvrX4IBKlQd0MNVgc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"rR-2Jh5T53ZKLe8ap6wbyNvNy_IFSEAVxz87YHrP8btcvLZ0hezD4AIPOh-RjGMDz-C_YM5EbKRNlCkPeI4AIw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xed40f95a2519f6a2978052701b2eaca2ae45c0e528e45ad6d695e363220ae99416e1cf17bd6235acd1ec0691833df88f211d1261351cfc1336c892b63c4820c21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"u3Pqz9LpMORJTgHXuQM2wimc9N_7uGptOPjnDPI-hOM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8KFob14RseaNcOuhSSu2FFVNhJHvrX4IBKlQd0MNVgc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OF0W2gl_VQmouSeyvR2e4B_XuDEhs8GNDJES-_tua0s\"}"
