But there were some really good nuggets in there.\\n\\n”The average stock doesn’t go up over long periods of time. The average stock will eventually go down 100% Indexes work because they weed those out and replace them”\\n\\n“Shorting stocks is actually mathematically in your favor and that’s one of the secrets i have, that you have to search deeply for” His sample portfolio was 40% long 40% short 20% cash he believes in being cash heavy.\\n\\nHow often should you trade stocks? “If you own a stock for 10 dollars and you think it’s worth 20 you want it to happen as fast as possible because of opportunity cost” I would rather make 20% in two weeks then 100% in 2 years” As long as you have other opportunities”\\n\\n“If you think everything is overvalued or under valued You kind of suck and your process is not correct 8/10 stocks should be fairly valued”\\n\\n“I studied pharma that helped me invest in biotech stocks that’s more important then 13f filings and listening to cnbc” The information I got from working in pharma Made the 13f filings look like useless garbage in comparison”\\n\\n“The CEO is one of the most important factors, do you trust him to make big profits 10 years from now?”\\n\\n“Where boys Become men Most analysts don’t understand this, Apples 100 billion ev and 33 billion in profit Is 33% on your money It’s a calculation warren uses” ( this was years ago )\\n\\n“Investing 1% in something that could 10x is good risk management”\\n\\n“You have to look at all stocks Imagine going to a restaurant and only eating one dish out of 800 dishes And saying this is the best dish for sure! You have to try the other dishes to get perspective and to maybe find something even better”\\n\\n“ USA has more fairly valued companies in general, International stocks Are either super undervalued or overvalued. That’s what you want so you can buy undervalued and short overvalued”\\n\\n“I feel bad for people who look at p/e If Tesla is worth 50 billion And has 1 million in net profit it doesn’t mean it has 50 k p/e and should be avoided”\\n\\n“I like companies who make people think with a different part of there brain. Like Apple and Tesla. They don’t care about price they just have to have it. Usually great marketing, great design and a great product. With a great design comes a big price”\\n\\n“ very few people short sell It could be good a lot of the time In 2000-2012 you wouldn’t make a penny if you were long. Markets go down often”\\n\\n“You want to be as diversified as you can”\\n\\n“Don’t invest if you don’t have a good idea. Hedge funds are forced too invest”\\n\\n“Leverage if you have confidence in the Investment I made 50 million in the last 2 years with options and derivatives. But it is very risky so you have to be really sure”\\n\\n“Have a margin of safety”\\n\\n“Discount rate is gold It’s theoretical Basically you guess what growth they will have looking at the history of the company and you guess how long the company will stay alive. How much cash will it bring in, in its whole lifetime. So Apple for example might bring in 300 billion a year in profit times 20 years. Giving it a value of 6 trillion.\\n\\nBut it’s all theoretical It might live for 30 years It might get a worse profit growth It might shrink by 15% per year instead of 2% You don’t know” You give them a discount rate based on how risky the investment is how diversified they are and how easy it is to eat there lunch. This could take years as an investor to calculate correctly”\\n\\nBooks he recommended\\n\\n* Margin of safety\\n* common stocks and uncommon profits\\n* everything from warren buffet and Charlie munger\\n\\nFreemaboi\",\"timestamp\":1637212333,\"title\":\"If you think everything is overvalued or under valued You kind of suck\"},\"digest\":\"Ll5CrHsMEWiazEzTZgSkbeCLuw--g_FcnyCDUhTxlXk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4D7F85B80463a804d92c3245B307A11A125Ce380\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LQi2Vhr6rVTJLQzHn7GQaWqwoYudE0h2NcVOInrKcms\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FZYSPFF9f_JENNEWnBHvtlCGfdR49y6ruvClsx-r5LE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"m_PeslA0mmN-T6Pp2QrlWxuQNaoG2e25tesSQ5ZZaWfTTUh1wQqIW9x6sHRR_cQ8tapmzk18AMJjUtTMfH2TWA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x54344652b9e01e5f81bdd5838e8624ec3bca4e17490605b2e42759c50be4588a3ac1be86145e6328f86dbbe53179f47c48a34202e5a9dc81c1ccf3212baad42d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"LQi2Vhr6rVTJLQzHn7GQaWqwoYudE0h2NcVOInrKcms\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"FZYSPFF9f_JENNEWnBHvtlCGfdR49y6ruvClsx-r5LE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Ll5CrHsMEWiazEzTZgSkbeCLuw--g_FcnyCDUhTxlXk\"}"
