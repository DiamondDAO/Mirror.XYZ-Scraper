"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"the cooling properties of the water.  Perhaps, hereafter, a liquid food of the same character may be invented, which shall save us from mastication and all the diseases of the teeth.'\\n\\n\\\"Hollins and Shelldrake, at his invitation, divided a bottle between them, and he took a second.  The potent beverage was not long in acting on a brain so unaccustomed to its influence.  He grew unusually talkative and sentimental, in a few minutes.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh, sing, somebody!' he sighed in a hoarse rapture: `the night was made for Song.'\\n\\n\\\"Miss Ringtop, nothing loath, immediately commenced, \\\\`When stars are in the quiet skies;' but scarcely had she finished the first verse before Abel interrupted her.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Candor's the order of the day, isn't it?' he asked.\\n\\n\\\"`Yes!' `Yes!' two or three answered.\\n\\n\\\"`Well then,' said he, `candidly, Pauline, you've got the darn'dest squeaky voice'--\\n\\n\\\"Miss Ringtop gave a faint little scream of horror.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh, never mind!' he continued.  `We act according to impulse, don't we?  And I've the impulse to swear; and it's right.  Let Nature have her way.  Listen!  Damn, damn, damn, damn!  I never knew it was so easy.  Why, there's a pleasure in it!  Try it, Pauline! try it on me!'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Oh-ooh!' was all Miss Ringtop could utter.\\n\\n\\\"`Abel! Abel!' exclaimed Hollins, `the beer has got into your head.'\\n\\n\\\"`No, it isn't Beer,--it's Candor!' said Abel.  `It's your own proposal, Hollins.  Suppose it's evil to swear: isn't it better I should express it, and be done with it, than keep it bottled up to ferment in my mind?  Oh, you're a precious, consistent old humbug, you are!'\\n\\n\\\"And therewith he jumped off the stoop, and went dancing awkwardly down towards the water, singing in a most unmelodious voice, \\\\`'Tis home where'er the heart is.'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Oh, he may fall into the water!' exclaimed Eunice, in alarm.\\n\\n\\\"`He's not fool enough to do that,' said Shelldrake.  `His head is a little light, that's all.  The air will cool him down presently.'\\n\\nBut she arose and followed him, not satisfied with this assurance.  Miss Ringtop sat rigidly still.  She would have received with composure the news of his drowning.\\n\\n\\\"As Eunice's white dress disappeared among the cedars crowning the shore, I sprang up and ran after her.  I knew that Abel was not intoxicated, but simply excited, and I had no fear on his account: I obeyed an involuntary impulse.  On approaching the water, I heard their voices--hers in friendly persuasion, his in sentimental entreaty,--then the sound of oars in the row-locks.  Looking out from the last clump of cedars, I saw them seated in the boat, Eunice at the stern, while Abel, facing her, just dipped an oar now and then to keep from drifting with the tide.  She had found him already in the boat, which was loosely chained to a stone.  Stepping on one of the forward thwarts in her eagerness to persuade him to return, he sprang past her, jerked away the chain, and pushed off before she could escape.  She would have fallen, but he caught her and placed her in the stern, and then seated himself at the oars.  She must have been somewhat alarmed, but there was only indignation in her voice.  All this had transpired before my arrival, and the first words I heard bound me to the spot and kept me silent.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Abel, what does this mean?' she asked\\n\\n\\\"`It means Fate--Destiny!' he exclaimed, rather wildly.  `Ah, Eunice, ask the night, and the moon,--ask the impulse which told you to follow me!  Let us be candid like the old Arcadians we imitate.  Eunice, we know that we love each other: why should we conceal it any longer?  The Angel of Love comes down from the stars on his azure wings, and whispers to our hearts.  Let us confess to each other!  The female heart should not be timid, in this pure and beautiful atmosphere of Love which we breathe.  Come, Eunice! we are alone: let your heart speak to me!'\\n\\n\\\"Ned, if you've ever been in love, (we'll talk of that after a while,) you will easily understand what tortures I endured, in thus hearing him speak.  That HE should love Eunice!  It was a profanation to her, an outrage to me.  Yet the assurance with which he spoke!  COULD she love this conceited, ridiculous, repulsive fellow, after all?  I almost gasped for breath, as I clinched the prickly boughs of the cedars in my hands, and set my teeth, waiting to hear her answer.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`I will not hear such language!  Take me back to the shore!' she said, in very short, decided tones.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh, Eunice,' he groaned, (and now, I think he was perfectly sober,) `don't you love me, indeed?  *I* love you,--from my heart I do: yes, I love you.  Tell me how you feel towards me.'\\n\\n\\\"`Abel,' said she, earnestly, `I feel towards you only as a friend; and if you wish me to retain a friendly interest in you, you must never again talk in this manner.  I do not love you, and I never shall.  Let me go back to the house.'\\n\\n\\\"His head dropped upon his breast, but he rowed back to the shore, drew the bow upon the rocks, and assisted her to land.  Then, sitting down, he groaned forth--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Oh, Eunice, you have broken my heart!' and putting his big hands to his face, began to cry.\\n\\n\\\"She turned, placed one hand on his shoulder, and said in a calm, but kind tone--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`I am very sorry, Abel, but I cannot help it.'\\n\\n\\\"I slipped aside, that she might not see me, and we returned by separate paths.\\n\\n\\\"I slept very little that night.  The conviction which I chased away from my mind as often as it returned, that our Arcadian experiment was taking a ridiculous and at the same time impracticable development, became clearer and stronger.  I felt sure that our little community could not hold together much longer without an explosion.  I had a presentiment that Eunice shared my impressions.  My feelings towards her had reached that crisis where a declaration was imperative: but how to make it?  It was a terrible struggle between my shyness and my affection.  There was another circumstance in connection with this subject, which troubled me not a little.  Miss Ringtop evidently sought my company, and made me, as much as possible, the recipient of her sentimental outpourings.  I was not bold enough to repel her-- indeed I had none of that tact which is so useful in such emergencies,--and she seemed to misinterpret my submission.  Not only was her conversation pointedly directed to me, but she looked at me, when singing, (especially, \\\\`Thou, thou, reign'st in this bosom!') in a way that made me feel very uncomfortable.  What if Eunice should suspect an attachment towards her, on my part.  What if--oh, horror!--I had unconsciously said or done something to impress Miss Ringtop herself with the same conviction?  I shuddered as the thought crossed my mind.  One thing was very certain: this suspense was not to be endured much longer.\\n\\n\\\"We had an unusually silent breakfast the next morning.  Abel scarcely spoke, which the others attributed to  a natural feeling of shame, after his display of the previous evening.  Hollins and Shelldrake discussed Temperance, with a special view to his edification, and Miss Ringtop favored us with several quotations about `the maddening bowl,'--but he paid no attention to them.  Eunice was pale and thoughtful.  I had no doubt in my mind, that she was already contemplating a removal from Arcadia.  Perkins, whose perceptive faculties were by no means dull, whispered to me, `Shan't I bring up some porgies for supper?' but I shook my head.  I was busy with other thoughts, and did not join him in the wood, that day.\\n\\n\\\"The forenoon was overcast, with frequent showers.  Each one occupied his or her room until dinner-time, when we met again with something of the old geniality.  There was an evident effort to restore our former flow of good feeling.  Abel's experience with the beer was freely discussed.  He insisted strongly that he had not been laboring under its effects, and proposed a mutual test.  He, Shelldrake, and Hollins were to drink it in equal measures, and compare observations as to their physical sensations.  The others agreed,--quite willingly, I thought,--but I refused.  I had determined to make a desperate attempt at candor, and Abel's fate was fresh before my eyes.\\n\\n\\\"My nervous agitation increased during the day, and after sunset, fearing lest I should betray my excitement in some way, I walked down to the end of the promontory, and took a seat on the rocks.  The sky had cleared, and the air was deliciously cool and sweet.  The Sound was spread out before me like a sea, for the Long Island shore was veiled in a silvery mist.  My mind was soothed and calmed by the influences of the scene, until the moon arose.  Moonlight, you know, disturbs--at least, when one is in love.  (Ah, Ned, I see you understand it!)  I felt blissfully miserable, ready to cry with joy at the knowledge that I loved, and with fear and vexation at my cowardice, at the same time.\\n\\n\\\"Suddenly I heard a rustling beside me.  Every nerve in my body tingled, and I turned my head, with a beating and expectant heart.  Pshaw!  It was Miss Ringtop, who spread her blue dress on the rock beside me, and shook back her long curls, and sighed, as she gazed at the silver path of the moon on the water.\\n\\n\\\"`Oh, how delicious!' she cried.  `How it seems to set the spirit free, and we wander off on the wings of Fancy to other spheres!'\\n\\n\\\"`Yes,' said I, `It is very beautiful, but sad, when one is alone.'\\n\\n\\\"I was thinking of Eunice.\\n\\n\\\"`How inadequate,' she continued, `is language to express the emotions which such a scene calls up in the bosom!  Poetry alone is the voice of the spiritual world, and we, who are not poets, must borrow the language of the gifted sons of Song.  Oh, Enos, I WISH you were a poet!  But you FEEL poetry, I know you do.  I have seen it in your eyes, when I quoted the burning lines of Adeliza Kelley, or the soul-breathings of Gamaliel J. Gawthrop.  In HIM, particularly, I find the voice of my own nature.  Do you know his \\\\`Night-Whispers?'  How it embodies the feelings of such a scene as this!\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"Star-drooping bowers bending down the spaces,          And moonlit glories sweep star-footed on;          And pale, sweet rivers, in their shining races,          Are ever gliding through the moonlit places,          With silver ripples on their tranced faces,     And forests clasp their dusky hands, with low and sullen moan!'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"`Ah!' she continued, as I made no reply, `this is an hour for the soul to unveil its most secret chambers!  Do you not think, Enos, that love rises superior to all conventionalities? that those whose souls are in unison should be allowed to reveal themselves to each other, regardless of the world's opinions?'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Yes!' said I, earnestly.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Enos, do you understand me?' she asked, in a tender voice--almost a whisper.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Yes,' said I, with a blushing confidence of my own passion.\\n\\n\\\"`Then,' she whispered, `our hearts are wholly in unison.  I know you are true, Enos.  I know your noble nature, and I will never doubt you.  This is indeed happiness!'\\n\\n\\\"And therewith she laid her head on my shoulder, and sighed--\\n\\n```\\n    \\\"`Life remits his tortures cruel,          Love illumes his fairest fuel,          When the hearts that once were dual          Meet as one, in sweet renewal!'\\n```\\n\\n\\\"`Miss Ringtop!' I cried, starting away from her, in alarm, `you don't mean that--that--'\\n\\n\\\"I could not finish the sentence.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Yes, Enos, DEAR Enos! henceforth we belong to each other.'\\n\\n\\\"The painful embarrassment I felt, as her true meaning shot through my mind, surpassed anything I had imagined, or experienced in anticipation, when planning how I should declare myself to Eunice.  Miss Ringtop was at least ten years older than I, far from handsome (but you remember her face,) and so affectedly sentimental, that I, sentimental as I was then, was sick of hearing her talk.  Her hallucination was so monstrous, and gave me such a shock of desperate alarm, that I spoke, on the impulse of the moment, with great energy, without regarding how her feelings might be wounded.\\n\\n\\\"`You mistake!' I exclaimed.  `I didn't mean that,--I didn't understand you.  Don't talk to me that way,--don't look at me in that way, Miss Ringtop!  We were never meant for each other--I wasn't----You're so much older--I mean different.  It can't be--no, it can never be!  Let us go back to the house: the night is cold.'\\n\\n\\\"I rose hastily to my feet.  She murmured something,--what, I did not stay to hear,--but, plunging through the cedars, was hurrying with all speed to the house, when, half-way up the lawn, beside one of the rocky knobs, I met Eunice, who was apparently on her way to join us.\\n\\nIn my excited mood, after the ordeal through which I had passed, everything seemed easy.  My usual timidity was blown to the four winds.  I went directly to her, took her hand, and said--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Eunice, the others are driving me mad with their candor; will you let me be candid, too?'\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`I think you are always candid, Enos,' she answered.\\n\\n\\\"Even then, if I had hesitated, I should have been lost.  But I went on, without pausing--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Eunice, I love you--I have loved you since we first met.  I came here that I might be near you; but I must leave you forever, and to-night, unless you can trust your life in my keeping.  God help me, since we have been together I have lost my faith in almost everything but you.  Pardon me, if I am impetuous--different from what I have seemed.  I have struggled so hard to speak!  I have been a coward, Eunice, because of my love.  But now I have spoken, from my heart of hearts.  Look at me: I can bear it now.  Read the truth in my eyes, before you answer.'\\n\\n\\\"I felt her hand tremble while I spoke.  As she turned towards me her face, which had been averted, the moon shone full upon it, and I saw that tears were upon her cheeks.  What was said--whether anything was said--I cannot tell.  I felt the blessed fact, and that was enough.  That was the dawning of the true Arcadia.\\\"\\n\\nMrs. Billings, who had been silent during this recital, took her husband's hand and smiled.  Mr. Johnson felt a dull pang about the region of his heart.  If he had a secret, however, I do not feel justified in betraying it.\\n\\n\\\"It was late,\\\" Mr. Billings continued, \\\"before we returned to the house.  I had a special dread of again encountering Miss Ringtop, but she was wandering up and down the bluff, under the pines, singing, \\\\`The dream is past.'  There was a sound of loud voices, as we approached the stoop.  Hollins, Shelldrake and his wife, and Abel Mallory were sitting together near the door.  Perkins Brown, as usual, was crouched on the lowest step, with one leg over the other, and rubbing the top of his boot with a vigor which betrayed to me some secret mirth.  He looked up at me from under his straw hat with the grin of a malicious Puck, glanced towards the group, and made a curious gesture with his thumb.  There were several empty pint-bottles on the stoop.\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Now, are you sure you can bear the test?' we heard Hollins ask, as we approached.\\n\\n\\\"`Bear it?  Why to be sure!' replied Shelldrake; `if I couldn't bear it, or if YOU couldn't, your theory's done for.  Try!  I can stand it as long as you can.'\\n\\n\\\"`Well, then,' said Hollins, `I think you are a very ordinary man.  I derive no intellectual benefit from my intercourse with you, but your house is convenient to me.  I'm under no obligations for your hospitality, however, because my company is an advantage to you.  Indeed if I were treated according to my deserts, you couldn't do enough for me.'\\n\\n\\\"Mrs. Shelldrake was up in arms.\\n\\n\\\"`Indeed,' she exclaimed, `I think you get as good as you deserve, and more too.'\\n\\n\\\"`Elvira,' said he, with a benevolent condescension, `I have no doubt you think so, for your mind belongs to the lowest and most material sphere.  You have your place in Nature, and you fill it; but it is not for you to judge of intelligences which move only on the upper planes.'\\n\\n\\\"`Hollins,' said Shelldrake, `Elviry's a good wife and a sensible woman, and I won't allow you to turn up your nose at her.'\\n\\n\\\"`I am not surprised,' he answered, `that you should fail to stand the test.  I didn't expect it.'\\n\\n\\\"`Let me try it on YOU!' cried Shelldrake.  `You, now, have some intellect,--I don't deny that,--but not so much, by a long shot, as you think you have.  Besides that, you're awfully selfish in your opinions.  You won't admit that anybody can be right who differs from you.  You've sponged on me for a long time; but I suppose I've learned something from you, so we'll call it even.  I think, however, that what you call acting according to impulse is simply an excuse to cover your own laziness.'\\n\\n\\\"`Gosh! that's it!' interrupted Perkins, jumping up; then, recollecting himself, he sank down on the steps again, and shook with a suppressed `Ho! ho! ho!'\\n\\n\\\"Hollins, however, drew himself up with an exasperated air.\\n\\n\\\"`Shelldrake,' said he, `I pity you.  I always knew your ignorance, but I thought you honest in your human character.  I never suspected you of envy and malice.  However, the true Reformer must expect to be misunderstood and misrepresented by meaner minds.  That love which I bear to all creatures teaches me to forgive you.  Without such love, all plans of progress must fail.  Is it not so, Abel?'\\n\\n\\\"Shelldrake could only ejaculate the words, `Pity!' `Forgive?' in his most contemptuous tone; while Mrs. Shelldrake, rocking violently in her chair, gave utterance to that peculiar clucking, \\\\`TS, TS, TS, TS,' whereby certain women express emotions too deep for words.\\n\\n\\\"Abel, roused by Hollins's question, answered, with a sudden energy--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Love! there is no love in the world.  Where will you find it?  Tell me, and I'll go there.  Love!  I'd like to see it!  If all human hearts were like mine, we might have an Arcadia; but most men have no hearts.  The world is a miserable, hollow, deceitful shell of vanity and hypocrisy.  No: let us give up.  We were born before our time: this age is not worthy of us.'\\n\\n\\\"Hollins stared at the speaker in utter amazement.  Shelldrake gave a long whistle, and finally gasped out--\\n\\n\\\"\\\\`Well, what next?'\\n\\n\\\"None of us were prepared for such a sudden and complete wreck of our Arcadian scheme.  The foundations had been sapped before, it is true; but we had not perceived it; and now, in two short days, the whole edifice tumbled about our ears.  Though it was inevitable, we felt a shock of sorrow, and a silence fell upon us.  Only that scamp of a Perkins Brown, chuckling and rubbing his boot, really rejoiced.  I could have kicked him.\\n\\n\\\"We all went to bed, feeling that the charm of our Arcadian life was over.  I was so full of the new happiness of love that I was scarcely conscious of regret.  I seemed to have leaped at once into responsible manhood, and a glad rush of courage filled me at the knowledge that my own heart was a better oracle than those--now so shamefully overthrown--on whom I had so long implicitly relied.  In the first revulsion of feeling, I was perhaps unjust to my associates.  I see now, more clearly, the causes of those vagaries, which originated in a genuine aspiration, and failed from an ignorance of the true nature of Man, quite as much as from the egotism of the individuals.  Other attempts at reorganizing Society were made about the same time by men of culture and experience, but in the A. C. we had neither.  Our leaders had caught a few half- truths, which, in their minds, were speedily warped into errors.  I can laugh over the absurdities I helped to perpetrate, but I must confess that the experiences of those few weeks went far towards making a man of me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did the A. C. break up at once?\\\" asked Mr. Johnson.\\n\\n\\\"Not precisely; though Eunice and I left the house within two days, as we had agreed.  We were not married immediately, however.  Three long years--years of hope and mutual encouragement--passed away before that happy consummation.  Before our departure, Hollins had fallen into his old manner, convinced, apparently, that Candor must be postponed to a better age of the world.  But the quarrel rankled in Shelldrake's mind, and especially in that of his wife.  I could see by her looks and little fidgety ways that his further stay would be very uncomfortable.  Abel Mallory, finding himself gaining in weight and improving in color, had no thought of returning.  The day previous, as I afterwards learned, he had discovered Perkins Brown's secret kitchen in the woods.\\n\\n\\\"`Golly!' said that youth, in describing the circumstance to me, `I had to ketch TWO porgies that day.'\\n\\n\\\"Miss Ringtop, who must have suspected the new relation between Eunice and myself, was for the most part rigidly silent.  If she quoted, it was from the darkest and dreariest utterances of her favorite Gamaliel.\\n\\n\\\"What happened after our departure I learned from Perkins, on the return of the Shelldrakes to Norridgeport, in September.  Mrs. Shelldrake stoutly persisted in refusing to make Hollins's bed, or to wash his shirts.  Her brain was dull, to be sure; but she was therefore all the more stubborn in her resentment.  He bore this state of things for about a week, when his engagements to lecture in Ohio suddenly called him away.  Abel and Miss Ringtop were left to wander about the promontory in company, and to exchange lamentations on the hollowness of human hopes or the pleasures of despair.  Whether it was owing to that attraction of sex which would make any man and any woman, thrown together on a desert island, finally become mates, or whether she skilfully ministered to Abel's sentimental vanity, I will not undertake to decide: but the fact is, they were actually betrothed, on leaving Arcadia.  I think he would willingly have retreated, after his return to the world; but that was not so easy.  Miss Ringtop held him with an inexorable clutch.  They were not married, however, until just before his departure for California, whither she afterwards followed him.  She died in less than a year, and left him free.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And what became of the other Arcadians?\\\" asked Mr. Johnson.\\n\\n\\\"The Shelldrakes are still living in Norridgeport.  They have become Spiritualists, I understand, and cultivate Mediums.  Hollins, when I last heard of him, was a Deputy-Surveyor in the New York Custom-House.  Perkins Brown is our butcher here in Waterbury, and he often asks me--\\\\`Do you take chloride of soda on your beefsteaks?'  He is as fat as a prize ox, and the father of five children.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Enos!\\\" exclaimed Mrs. Billings, looking at the clock, \\\"it's nearly midnight!  Mr. Johnson must be very tired, after such a long story.\\n\\nThe Chapter of the A. C. is hereby closed!\\\"\\n\\nFRIEND ELI'S DAUGHTER.\\n\\nI.\\n\\nThe mild May afternoon was drawing to a close, as Friend Eli Mitch-\\n\\nenor reached the top of the long hill, and halted a few minutes, to allow his horse time to recover breath.  He also heaved a sigh of satisfaction, as he saw again the green, undulating valley of the Neshaminy, with its dazzling squares of young wheat, its brown patches of corn-land, its snowy masses of blooming orchard, and the huge, fountain like jets of weeping willow, half concealing the gray stone fronts of the farm-houses.  He had been absent from home only six days, but the time seemed almost as long to him as a three years' cruise to a New Bedford whaleman.  The peaceful seclusion and pastoral beauty of the scene did not consciously appeal to his senses; but he quietly noted how much the wheat had grown during his absence, that the oats were up and looking well, that Friend Comly's meadow had been ploughed, and Friend Martin had built his half of the line-fence along the top of the hill-field.  If any smothered delight in the loveliness of the spring-time found a hiding-place anywhere in the well-ordered chambers of his heart, it never relaxed or softened the straight, inflexible lines of his face.  As easily could his collarless drab coat and waistcoat have flushed with a sudden gleam of purple or crimson.\\n\\nEli Mitchenor was at peace with himself and the world--that is, so much of the world as he acknowledged.  Beyond the community of his own sect, and a few personal friends who were privileged to live on its borders, he neither knew nor cared to know much more of the human race than if it belonged to a planet farther from the sun.  In the discipline of the Friends he was perfect; he was privileged to sit on the high seats, with the elders of the Society; and the travelling brethren from other States, who visited Bucks County, invariably blessed his house with a family-meeting.  His farm was one of the best on the banks of the Neshaminy, and he also enjoyed the annual interest of a few thousand dollars, carefully secured by mortgages on real estate.  His wife, Abigail, kept even pace with him in the consideration she enjoyed within the limits of the sect; and his two children, Moses and Asenath, vindicated the paternal training by the strictest sobriety of dress and conduct.  Moses wore the plain coat, even when his ways led him among \\\"the world's people;\\\" and Asenath had never been known to wear, or to express a desire for, a ribbon of a brighter tint than brown or fawn-color.  Friend Mitchenor had thus gradually ripened to his sixtieth year in an atmosphere of life utterly placid and serene, and looked forward with confidence to the final change, as a translation into a deeper calm, a serener quiet, a prosperous eternity of mild voices, subdued colors, and suppressed emotions.\\n\\nHe was returning home, in his own old-fashioned \\\"chair,\\\" with its heavy square canopy and huge curved springs, from the Yearly Meeting of the Hicksite Friends, in Philadelphia.  The large bay farm-horse, slow and grave in his demeanor, wore his plain harness with an air which made him seem, among his fellow-horses, the counterpart of his master among men.  He would no more have thought of kicking than the latter would of swearing a huge oath.  Even now, when the top of the hill was gained, and he knew that he was within a mile of the stable which had been his home since colthood, he showed no undue haste or impatience, but waited quietly, until Friend Mitchenor, by a well-known jerk of the lines, gave him the signal to go on.  Obedient to the motion, he thereupon set forward once more, jogging soberly down the eastern slope of the hill,-- across the covered bridge, where, in spite of the tempting level of the hollow-sounding floor, he was as careful to abstain from trotting as if he had read the warning notice,--along the wooded edge of the green meadow, where several cows of his acquaintance were grazing,--and finally, wheeling around at the proper angle, halted squarely in front of the gate which gave entrance to the private lane.\\n\\nThe old stone house in front, the spring-house in a green little hollow just below it, the walled garden, with its clumps of box and lilac, and the vast barn on the left, all joining in expressing a silent welcome to their owner, as he drove up the lane.  Moses, a man of twenty-five, left his work in the garden, and walked forward in his shirt-sleeves.\\n\\n\\\"Well, father, how does thee do?\\\" was his quiet greeting, as they shook hands.\\n\\n\\\"How's mother, by this time?\\\" asked Eli.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, thee needn't have been concerned,\\\" said the son.  \\\"There she is.  Go in:  I'll tend to the horse.\\\"\\n\\nAbigail and her daughter appeared on the piazza.  The mother was a woman of fifty, thin and delicate in frame, but with a smooth, placid beauty of countenance which had survived her youth.  She was dressed in a simple dove-colored gown, with book-muslin cap and handkerchief, so scrupulously arranged that one might have associated with her for six months without ever discovering a spot on the former, or an uneven fold in the latter.  Asenath, who followed, was almost as plainly attired, her dress being a dark- blue calico, while a white pasteboard sun-bonnet, with broad cape, covered her head.\\n\\n\\\"Well, Abigail, how art thou?\\\" said Eli, quietly giving his hand to his wife.\\n\\n\\\"I'm glad to see thee back,\\\" was her simple welcome.\\n\\nNo doubt they had kissed each other as lovers, but Asenath had witnessed this manifestation of affection but once in her life-- after the burial of a younger sister.  The fact impressed her with a peculiar sense of sanctity and solemnity: it was a caress wrung forth by a season of tribulation, and therefore was too earnest to be profaned to the uses of joy.  So far, therefore, from expecting a paternal embrace, she would have felt, had it been given, like the doomed daughter of the Gileadite, consecrated to sacrifice.\\n\\nBoth she and her mother were anxious to hear the proceedings of the meeting, and to receive personal news of the many friends whom Eli had seen; but they asked few questions until the supper-table was ready and Moses had come in from the barn.  The old man enjoyed talking, but it must be in his own way and at his own good time.  They must wait until the communicative spirit should move him.  With the first cup of coffee the inspiration came.  Hovering at first over indifferent details, he gradually approached those of more importance,--told of the addresses which had been made, the points of discipline discussed, the testimony borne, and the appearance and genealogy of any new Friends who had taken a prominent part therein.  Finally, at the close of his relation, he said--\\n\\n\\\"Abigail, there is one thing I must talk to thee about.  Friend Speakman's partner,--perhaps thee's heard of him, Richard Hilton,-- has a son who is weakly.  He's two or three years younger than Moses.  His mother was consumptive, and they're afraid he takes after her.  His father wants to send him into the country for the summer--to some place where he'll have good air, and quiet, and moderate exercise, and Friend Speakman spoke of us.  I thought I'd mention it to thee, and if thee thinks well of it, we can send word down next week, when Josiah Comly goes\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What does THEE think?\\\" asked his wife, after a pause\\n\\n\\\"He's a very quiet, steady young man, Friend Speakman says, and would be very little trouble to thee.  I thought perhaps his board would buy the new yoke of oxen we must have in the fall, and the price of the fat ones might go to help set up Moses.  But it's for thee to decide.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose we could take him,\\\" said Abigail, seeing that the decision was virtually made already; \\\"there's the corner room, which we don't often use.  Only, if he should get worse on our hands--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Friend Speakman says there's no danger.  He is only weak-breasted, as yet, and clerking isn't good for him.  I saw the young man at the store.  If his looks don't belie him, he's well-behaved and orderly.\\\"\\n\\nSo it was settled that Richard Hilton the younger was to be an inmate of Friend Mitchenor's house during the summer.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nAt the end of ten days he came.\\n\\nIn the under-sized, earnest, dark-haired and dark-eyed young man of three-and-twenty, Abigail Mitchenor at once felt a motherly interest.  Having received him as a temporary member of the family, she considered him entitled to the same watchful care as if he were in reality an invalid son.  The ice over an hereditary Quaker nature is but a thin crust, if one knows how to break it; and in Richard Hilton's case, it was already broken before his arrival.  His only embarrassment, in fact, arose from the difficulty which he naturally experienced in adapting himself to the speech and address of the Mitchenor family.  The greetings of old Eli, grave, yet kindly, of Abigail, quaintly familiar and tender, of Moses, cordial and slightly condescending, and finally of Asenath, simple and natural to a degree which impressed him like a new revelation in woman, at once indicated to him his position among them.  His city manners, he felt, instinctively, must be unlearned, or at least laid aside for a time.  Yet it was not easy for him to assume, at such short notice, those of his hosts.  Happening to address Asenath as \\\"Miss Mitchenor,\\\" Eli turned to him with a rebuking face.\\n\\n\\\"We do not use compliments, Richard,\\\" said he; \\\"my daughter's name is Asenath.\\n\\n\\\"I beg pardon.  I will try to accustom myself to your ways, since you have been so kind as to take me for a while,\\\" apologized Richard Hilton.\\n\\n\\\"Thee's under no obligation to us,\\\" said Friend Mitchenor, in his strict sense of justice; \\\"thee pays for what thee gets.\\\"\\n\\nThe finer feminine instinct of Abigail led her to interpose.\\n\\n\\\"We'll not expect too much of thee, at first, Richard,\\\" she remarked, with a kind expression of face, which had the effect of a smile: \\\"but our ways are plain and easily learned.  Thee knows, perhaps, that we're no respecters of persons.\\\"\\n\\nIt was some days, however, before the young man could overcome his natural hesitation at the familiarity implied by these new forms of speech.  \\\"Friend Mitchenor\\\" and \\\"Moses\\\" were not difficult to learn, but it seemed a want of respect to address as \\\"Abigail\\\" a woman of such sweet and serene dignity as the mother, and he was fain to avoid either extreme by calling her, with her cheerful permission, \\\"Aunt Mitchenor.\\\"  On the other hand, his own modest and unobtrusive nature soon won the confidence and cordial regard of the family.  He occasionally busied himself in the garden, by way of exercise, or accompanied Moses to the corn-field or the woodland on the hill, but was careful never to interfere at inopportune times, and willing to learn silently, by the simple process of looking on.\\n\\nOne afternoon, as he was idly sitting on the stone wall which separated the garden from the lane, Asenath, attired in a new gown of chocolate-colored calico, with a double-handled willow work- basket on her arm, issued from the house.  As she approached him, she paused and said--\\n\\n\\\"The time seems to hang heavy on thy hands, Richard.  If thee's strong enough to walk to the village and back, it might do thee more good than sitting still.\\\"\\n\\nRichard Hilton at once jumped down from the wall.\\n\\n\\\"Certainly I am able to go,\\\" said he, \\\"if you will allow it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Haven't I asked thee?\\\" was her quiet reply.\\n\\n\\\"Let me carry your basket,\\\" he said, suddenly, after they had walked, side by side, some distance down the lane.\\n\\n\\\"Indeed, I shall not let thee do that.  I'm only going for the mail, and some little things at the store, that make no weight at all.  Thee mustn't think I'm like the young women in the city, who, I'm told, if they buy a spool of Cotton, must have it sent home to them.  Besides, thee mustn't over-exert thy strength.\\\"\\n\\nRichard Hilton laughed merrily at the gravity with which she uttered the last sentence.\\n\\n\\\"Why, Miss--Asenath, I mean--what am I good for; if I have not strength enough to carry a basket?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thee's a man, I know, and I think a man would almost as lief be thought wicked as weak.  Thee can't help being weakly-inclined, and it's only right that thee should be careful of thyself.  There's surely nothing in that that thee need be ashamed of.\\\"\\n\\nWhile thus speaking, Asenath moderated her walk, in order, unconsciously to her companion, to restrain his steps.\",\"timestamp\":1640141979,\"title\":\"The effect of beer,' said he, `depends, I think, on the commixture of the nourishing principle of the grain\"},\"digest\":\"n4gMNRg1uiEAZHCp3f72bLFwMoM171baz8xkQGdRfTw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x90172af57cfCfbdA1dac8055668d7B5df7f90f1E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"87PA9Ssb4BnRRs5WlFh6M-FKeyQbHfiyajzlaGmj_8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"osP-mswcR77TuKqR1dK644bIMIHImyr7qQOGtWryt_o\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"E8_99XGbwYd8wbyAQqLqXqP3nRmim_WF-8EPhCnHeW_UlF0OWIwo8ykIA4DWX9OCzmZrjsV7J4AtQFf8Gp4D3Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3a011fd8a8f8c1f467a45b6169514e05e406f4e22aa64721ac3c9bb012554d56316127627fb24292941453b4931388783e078862d9bd32c8c656a255853195291c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"87PA9Ssb4BnRRs5WlFh6M-FKeyQbHfiyajzlaGmj_8E\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"osP-mswcR77TuKqR1dK644bIMIHImyr7qQOGtWryt_o\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"n4gMNRg1uiEAZHCp3f72bLFwMoM171baz8xkQGdRfTw\"}"
