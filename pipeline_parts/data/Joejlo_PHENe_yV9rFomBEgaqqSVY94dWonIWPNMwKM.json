"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is not a definitive list, and of course is subjective. My own journey from #tradart to digital art started obliquely, and I don’t recall how i first entered, though in a short period, like many, I became enthralled with the possibilities.  \\n  \\n It was clear in November and December of 2020, that cryptopunks were a special combination of aesthetic and technological innovation. Such that driving on vacation in the wonderful wilds of south west Tasmania, Australia, home of the astonishing Franklin river, all I could do was swear about transfer limits on my tradfi bank account, working on my cellphone.  \\n  \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/12EpSemwLnTjTvglwjuzv.png?height=976&width=1124)\\n\\n![The punk I 10x'd. It has not sold since. wtf was i doing on boxing day](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/VDBgZp7WWyr9nJJlEbG1c.png?height=684&width=1768)\\n\\nIn then end bought 20-25 or so cryptopunks and sold way too early about six to eight weeks later for $2M or so (correct me on my eth address if that figure is wrong). Needless to say a stressful time. And excuse my white male privilege, but the money means much less than the aesthetic and intellectual interest of being correct with an *idea.* \\n\\nAll that to say that I have no particular qualification to delineate the following, other than that, the CP journey has opened my eyes to the astonishing possibilities of cryptoart/digital art. And that is mainly in the realm of *ideas and new ways of seeing.*  \\n  \\n Here lies the subsequent journey and thinking behind collecting and interest from 2020 to now.  \\n  \\n What follows is a fairly mainstream view of the major players in cutting edge digital art as I see it. These artists will go longer and stronger than you think. Also talking book but whatever it’s blockchain so do your own diligence. \\n\\n1. **Damien Hirst** \\n Strange to add a tradartist first I know. But what is of interest here is the uncomfortable squirming of an established and wildly successful businessman entering the NFT space. Hirst’s primary motivation is to succeed, in the manner of Jeff Koons. Dollars over admirers, or the stamp of historical significance. But in that he has indeed succeeded, and so when an early NFT project called the ‘currency’ is launched, one must well, ahem, join them rather than beat them. \\n  \\n The premise is that 10,000 works created by assistants back in 2016 are somehow both prescient and individually significant. Though they are absurdly similar. There are certainly some Yes Minister moments parsing the discord, when individual ‘traits’ are debated. But overall the project is baldy and transparently money focussed, with royalty and quarterly economic reports forthcoming, in the manner of a listed company. \\n\\n![yeah make me rich first](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Ye2K3wyXLDHk8R0NHaSqM.png?height=966&width=2596)\\n\\nHaving said that, Hirst is a professional and the whole project is flawlessly presented. All other artists take note. I bought 30 or so and the value exploded from $2K to $65K USD, but is now as low as $11K. Buy here. Here’s the rub: all the physicals will be burnt shortly, and tradart will buy the hell out of the remainder because the palm blockchain is still a barrier, and the audience is double wrongfooted from naviagting nft’s in general, in addition to an obscure palm blockchain. Accumulating physicals heavily from here, burning NFTs. Hirst is ahead, and in some senses, visionary. But mainly about money. Price action will be kind in the medium term. \\n  \\n **2. Robness Cyberpop** \\n A short dive into cryptoart leads to robness. Brash, aggressively ALL CAPITALS in tweets, and actually original, he is hard to ignore.  \\n  \\n There are sound arguments around CC0, postmodernism, right click and save as well as important battles for artist vs. corporate control embodied in this work. Deeper than first glance, and IMO historically significant. Buying for the ideas and historical significance. FOMAmag is also worth checking out. More to say later here and super interesting. \\n\\n![Scarlet toter via nft boxes. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/m2wx6pp9J6xVD4rOnZCHg.png?height=1876&width=1962)\\n\\n**3.Xcopy \\n  \\n **There is a time in everyone’s life where you realise that being popular may just mean that you are are *really fucking good.* Remember the time you saw Prince play live and realised the dude had command of the whole stack. Original yet mainstream. To examine Xcopy’s tumblr page (checks how to, how do i post a link here…) \\n  \\n \\n\\n[https://xcopy.tumblr.com/](https://xcopy.tumblr.com/)\\n\\ngoing back a decade or more reveals publicly how OG an actual OG can be. Moreover, Xcopy remains anonymous, totally normal, and engaged in his discord. Character ftw. \\n\\n![Robert Motherwell ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3vIlLlDAzIWBp-IiZ2EmU.png?height=724&width=1154)\\n\\nWhat xcopy does is unique, and was first of kind *ten years ago.* If you can afford to buy him, buy everything you can. History will be kind to this true visionary. Shimmering, glitchy, neon, gothic and much, ahem, copied.\\n\\n![Sell the kidney, wife and kids for this ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/S6BvdnbiL6TCkED_7ukyP.png?height=1618&width=1504)\\n\\n**4 Giant Swan \\n  \\n **Having tweeted relentlessly about giant swan, I think my aesthetic feelings are known. What is important is the notion of progression of work via a command of the technical aspects of 3D/VR art. If Giant swan can navigate the tech, he is clearly at the forefront of a totally new way of seeing. Consider current and early works as roadmaps for future potential across many media. Both organic and digital, you only need to see the product of live work to confirm raw talent. Super promising and at best in gothic mode like this collab with varien. Another NFT Boxes discovery.  \\n \\n\\n![Rot. 1/153](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/PXSqWRXgDnaH_kXC36drX.png?height=1200&width=1988)\\n\\n**5.  John Karel**  \\n  \\n Tezos is undoubtedly fertile ground, and no artist is as emblematic of the potential than John Karel. To listen to him speak on podcasts it is clear he is both a true artist but also a true independent. This work is still cheap, by virtue of the tezos barrier. Doesn’t change the fact that it remains, and will be canonical going forward. I don’t own (yet), because also can’t be bothered with yet another blockchain  (hello nft rune!).  \\n \\n\\n![Iconic already.
