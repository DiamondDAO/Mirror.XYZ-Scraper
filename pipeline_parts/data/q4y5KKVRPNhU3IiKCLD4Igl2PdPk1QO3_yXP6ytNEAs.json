"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"This is the first part of the Arrow Markets series, which will introduce the main interactions of the beta test network. The next part will introduce the principle behind arrow markets, so stay tuned.\\n\\n**What is Arrow Markets**\\n\\nAdapted from official documentsï¼š\\n\\n[https://blog.arrow.markets/introducing-arrow-markets-afaaa26b12a1](https://blog.arrow.markets/introducing-arrow-markets-afaaa26b12a1)\\n\\nIn traditional options markets, options must be sold by the seller, who charges a premium to the buyer, and the seller is responsible for paying the buyer if the option is exercised in monetary terms. As an options agreement on [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), Arrow Markets will give users the ability to purchase options without having to match with such counterparties.\\n\\nArrow will enable end users to interact with DFMs (decentralized financial markets) built around arbitrary crypto substrates, such as BTC, ETH and AVAX. DFMs facilitate the creation and settlement of options and allow users to create custom assets by combining options across strikes, expirations and underlying securities.\\n\\n**beta test details**\\n\\nOpen the following test network.\\n\\n[https://fuji-beta.arrow.markets/](https://fuji-beta.arrow.markets/)\\n\\nLink little fox wallet, switch to avax fuji testnet.\\n\\n![User Agreement](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/L_mCEoGqiWP8U7VKklTxN.png?height=865&width=1399)\\n\\n**Then confirm the user agreement in the image above. We came to the following screen.**\\n\\n![Main Interface\\n\\n](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nYTawvucf90_RpcSJym_q.png?height=864&width=1301)\\n\\n**Step 2**\\n\\nThe current beta version supports options on four assets (AMAX, ETH, BTC, LINK) and Arrow allows us to customize the options to suit our needs. Why is this important? Because options are very dependent on liquidity, and the liquidity of options with different attributes varies greatly, a problem that exists even for options on Deribit, now the largest crypto options platform. arrow's CCAMM uses off-chain resources, allowing for more complex forecasting and pricing calculations than on-chain, solving the problem of traditional options markets requiring counterparties. The next section describes the specific interaction process using AMAX as an example.\\n\\nArrows offers two modes to view options quotes, and we'll start with the Novice mode (assuming you're new to options).\\n\\n![Newbie mode](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/vBw1osvkBMo2Ot2cIm6w6.png?height=525&width=1135)\\n\\nSimply put, the price of an option is related to (the value you expect the underlying asset to be at a future date), (the date a future date is from the present), and (the amount you are betting). Arrow's CCAMM will calculate the corresponding option price and the number of options based on the above three variables, and you can purchase them by clicking on CONFIRM at the bottom right.\\n\\nThe figure on the left is your profit and loss at maturity graph. Let's check why the numbers above were obtained so you can better understand them. Let's take the option above as an example. It is an AVAX call (real) option with a strike price of $92.42 and an expiration date of January 9th. You need to pay $24.43 to get this option. That is, you have the right to buy an AVAX for $92.42 on January 9. When will you exercise this right? When and only when the price of the AVAX on the expiration date is higher than your cost, i.e. (92.42, the price to exercise the right to buy) + (24.43, the price paid to buy the option) = 116.85 greater than (the spot price of the AVAX on January 9th). Therefore, we get the break-even point of $116.85, which is the intersection of the left-hand fold with the 0-axis.\\n\\n![Specific calculations](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/4wIr7qYmwAk07Y2OOPda5.png?height=864&width=1299)\\n\\nFinally we look at the specific properties of this option (from left to right). First is the strike price, then DELTA (which can be approximated as the value of a $1 change in AVAX spot and a $1 change in our option price), followed by THETA (which represents the daily cost of holding this option as the expiration date approaches), then GAMMA (which represents the impact of AVAX volatility on the option price), and finally P&L, where the numbers below represent our gain or loss based on The numbers below represent our gain or loss if we exercise the option immediately, based on the current spot price. To check the math, spot AVAX = $115.65, our break-even point is $116.85, so we lost (116.85-115.65) = $1.2.\\n\\n![Option Properties](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/tzCeDpvgzYLGme8CjEoJZ.png?height=142&width=721)\\n\\nFinally, let's look at the options quotes in the Pro version (also known as the options quote table in the traditional market). Click on TABLE VIEW in the upper right corner.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/bfEor5DJDnlTYFOvuEBeb.png?height=242&width=717)\\n\\nA table of quotes for options with different strike prices and attributes is shown here. Compared to the first model, the options here are more limited, but they can basically meet the needs of traders.\\n\\n![Professional mode](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/mDGlT9tbPfL0kKv-KlAgp.png?height=315&width=717)\\n\\nTake the first option in the picture as an example, we click buy to purchase.\\n\\n![Professional Model Trading](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ttwaIMZImlEMTQWtGzllW.png?height=347&width=717)\\n\\nFinally, it is recommended that you experience both different modes when doing interactions. Experience trading both call and put options in both modes.
