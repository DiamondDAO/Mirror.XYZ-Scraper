"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I signed the Declaration for the Interdependence of Cyberspace, it is a forked declaration based on John Perry Barlow’s 1996 [Declaration for the Independence of Cyberspace](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence), but with the vision for the strong will of interdependence, the difference is highlighted, in line 13th, they both said: \\n\\n[https://www.interdependence.online/about](https://www.interdependence.online/about)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/myHugL8l8gThbCOVc6e43.png?height=551&width=1871)\\n\\nIt conveyed the message of the strong need for self-governance: the current ruler acted condescendingly with excuses to invade our own way of governance, forget about forced social protocol, we wish to rise in our own way.\\n\\nI browsed on Twitter, my daily digest source Chris Blec just wrote: \\n\\n> “ Every human being has the right to be left alone if they choose. \\n>\\n> Solitude might be the only ‘real’ human right.”\\n\\nFundamentally, we protest, we manifest, we fight, we strike, we shout, we burn, just to express the need of being alone, but living in this system, everything is imposing the idea of being alone is a shame, a crime, an backward social evolution, instead, under their law, we have to produce, reproduce, finding meaning, giving up selfness, contribute to the goal which is not even serving us any good.\\n\\nAre you tired yet?\\n\\nKeep spreading FOMO generate more value in the capital, but who could be benefited from it?  “Co-opt your language and expand your reach” could well explain it.\\n\\nWhy do we choose this rule if it’s not our game from the very beginning? We lived in other’s games and the creator just kept making this game look more like life, to blindfold those already “know” “decoded” the rules, but things won’t make much difference if we still live inside this game.\\n\\n[https://www.interdependence.online/diff/e-bw-AGkYsZFYqmAe2771A6hi9ZMIkWrkBNtHIF1hF4](https://www.interdependence.online/diff/e-bw-AGkYsZFYqmAe2771A6hi9ZMIkWrkBNtHIF1hF4)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1640014386,\"title\":\"Gamified Life / Lifelike Game\"},\"digest\":\"A5oYu_O9C7aQ7dgj9Gw0egyXFdVZp72gomVXUF92bOM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xb12e31D8F7DdA2Dd3733c25cB3B01F6924cd3497\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B28ZlAyy5dS2vpa5fa9Rw0eD7XPw_hH04efCOUWW-mA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eU5CcDXb1QCsotVRbehPyH5EV2ANpOz9_WvXsiYrqag\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"dcytGOH5H3jGSbtK5u2-UHFpRYR8sedCR4YAZRQTKdJlHMqPukbwB_Rffnox-m0ditQvEKs8f_raTtB7CvKHxQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x52d281babd9461b31c6d8acd20eda61ced4bb9ad6037930383d39aa7214823165a43d6e654a8b635db0d245181874fa7e38a51e5ff9905a6a3dec7d15a723e831b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"B28ZlAyy5dS2vpa5fa9Rw0eD7XPw_hH04efCOUWW-mA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"eU5CcDXb1QCsotVRbehPyH5EV2ANpOz9_WvXsiYrqag\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"WvnA1MaVieVJEj_5Hw7hlT1IupI8CKFwS9s_8JVMawI\"}"
