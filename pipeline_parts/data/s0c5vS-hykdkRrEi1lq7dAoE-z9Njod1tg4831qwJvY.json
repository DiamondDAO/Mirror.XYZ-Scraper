"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"So, I posted the other day about my disdain for the “Try Harder” mentality, and would now like to propose a much better alternative, the Try Smarter mindset. And this is not only beneficial for cybersecurity, but for all of life.\\n\\nNow, the biggest aspect of Try Smarter, is not that you can’t ask questions, but ask **good** questions. And by good question, I refer to certain aspects that are needed for a question to be good. What have you already tried? When we go to those that have more knowledge, it not only shows that you are earnestly trying to solve the issue, but that you respect their time by not asking something that could easily be searched for. Where have you already looked? Here, the person you ask may have specific places they know of for knowledge in that area, and knowing if you have already check it or not helps. What specific thing are you trying to achieve? This is sometimes the most important part. Because a solid scope of the issue, gives the person you are asking an out. And by that, I mean that they have a definitive time to be done and move on. \\n\\nAnother very important aspect of this mindset, is making use of the resources available to you. Specifically when it comes to technology, there is such a massive amount of free learning material available to people, so much can be added to your arsenal of knowledge easily. As my personal focus is on cybersecurity, I’ll share some links I find valuable:]\\n\\n*   [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn)\\n*   [Simply Cyber](https://www.simplycyber.io/)\\n*   [Cyber Supply Drop](https://www.cybersupplydrop.org/)\\n*   [Cyber Insecurity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL4JGzitDkX5TOwzs9A02Kg)\\n*   [Adrian Cantrell’s AWS Courses](https://learn.cantrill.io/)\\n*   [The Cyber Mentor](https://www.thecybermentor.com/)\\n*   [ATTACK IQ](https://attackiq.com/)\\n\\nMake the most of the free and low cost resources available all over the internet.
