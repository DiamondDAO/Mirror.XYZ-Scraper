[ + apply here + ](https://www.notion.so/Welcome-to-UNI-Grants-6e3e84967a984a5fb127ae749649ddc9)\\n\\ni've worked on [design & animation](https://vimeo.com/chrismartz) projects for tv, film, tech and now do a mix of freelance web3 work, design and research\\n\\ni make art and recently i've been making NFTs on [Zora](https://martz.mirror.xyz/IuJ1MpoYggEK1XkyLTuEsHpHMQaYjK0EERlQhUYT2W0), [Foundation](https://foundation.app/martz) and [Rarible](https://rarible.com/chrismartz)\\n\\n [NFT](ethereum://0x3B3ee1931Dc30C1957379FAc9aba94D1C48a5405/26184)\\n\\n\\n\\nyou can find me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/chrismartz)  and sometimes on discord in [Friends With Benefits](https://fwb.help/)\\n\\ni applied for the [Uniswap grant](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d) via their simple online form -

[our work is shared here](https://www.notion.so/3430a00270ea4d79be5c70d4ca99680a?v=b7b7697e1ff44055b87a6bd3480a3b2d) \\n\\n- in the short term this means [improving documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/) + creating more resources for learning Uniswap via design, illustration and animation\\n\\n- in the long term this could mean creating new spaces and things that welcome even more (+ more diverse) people to this \\\"New Space\\\"\\n\\n\\nthis \\\"New Space\\\" meaning:  Web3, crypto, DAOs, DeFi and NFTs\\n\\ni am talking to [jon-kyle](https://www.jon-kyle.com/) and [callil](https://callil.com/) about one of these projects now:\\n\\n\\n> - soft launch a mirror.xyz community publishing channel for Uniswap on mirror\\n\\n> - create a place for community members to get a spotlight and get paid for their creative works\\n\\n> - make governance fun and interesting\\n\\nright now, much of this process is active research but we will be building prototypes soon, here is very rough mockup\\n\\nUniversal Editions / Clout Universe / _TBD_ \\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/8bd350e7-0f5a-4d52-9319-1a3f28ae5172.png?height=1566&width=1096)\\n\\n\\n\\nthe concept is that curators get to vote in a [write race](https://mirror.xyz/race) type format but for their own publications or posts, the process is entirely open to the public\\n\\nthere is a set time period between each curator/community vote, and authors are encouraged to submit whatever they want (or respond to themes and prompts)\\n\\nfor simplicity, the user experience could feel as easy as writing a blog on medium or posting photos to instagram, or even just embedding a collection of tweets with some opinions\\n\\nsimilar to mirror, but simpler, to encourage ease of use for everyone and to not burden mirror's small team with thousands of new users lol\\n\\neach post could scale up to be large as a collaborative zine where editorial art is commissioned NFTs, embedded playlists of songs from [zora](https://zora.co/) or [catalog](https://beta.catalog.works/) or something as incredibly connected and layered as [Ezzzra's](https://twitter.com/ezzzrrra?lang=en) recent [Solvency](https://ezra.mirror.xyz/)\\n\\nit would be amazing to enable independent squads work to create these and be able to use [splits](https://dev.mirror.xyz/mQ03-JXlfdoBnRrZisC5X3kM9nBkOILlHwxbdq382Gw) to divide up the bounty\\n\\nit would be equally cool if this initial block could help us prototype the future [community blog](https://uniswap.org/blog/) for Uniswap.\\n\\npersonally my experience with FWB and even the Uniswap have really solidified how tokens and incentives can really motivate people curiosity and create some structure in a very limitless space\\n\\nif somewhat successful, other crypto ecosystems seeking community hubs could spin up their own versions using this mirror block\\n\\nI see direct parallels to this with many current DAOs and recently with the work zora is doing here with *Auction House*\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1392491120937086979?s=20\\n\\n\\nas a designer and a researcher i see massive potential and a a surplus of available funding in this space (apply!)\\n\\ni believe a good spend of these treasuries could be more human centered experiments, more public goods, more use cases\\n\\ni am interested in building ideas that reach people who may not understand the basics of crypto at all, or may be scared to explore a realm that feels \\\"sketchy\\\" or unfamiliar to them\\n\\nif you like any of this, plz let me know (buy my NFT) or if you have any conceptual feedback (or have a good name for the community hub) -
