"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"He's so great.  He could be the Prime Minister of England if he chose.  But then he would have to visit kings and nobles, and receive them at his house, and Mama--\\\"  She broke off with a passionate gesture of the small thin hands.\\n\\nJoan was puzzled what to say.  She knew exactly what she ought to say:  what she would have said to any ordinary child.  But to say it to this uncannily knowing little creature did not promise much good.\\n\\n\\\"Who told you I persuaded him?\\\" she asked.\\n\\n\\\"Nobody,\\\" answered the child.  \\\"I knew.\\\"\\n\\nJoan seated herself, and drew the child towards her.\\n\\n\\\"It isn't as terrible as you think,\\\" she said.  \\\"Many men who have risen and taken a high place in the world were married to kind, good women unable to share their greatness.  There was Shakespeare, you know, who married Anne Hathaway and had a clever daughter.  She was just a nice, homely body a few years older than himself.  And he seems to have been very fond of her; and was always running down to Stratford to be with her.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but he didn't bring her up to London,\\\" answered the child. \\\"Mama would have wanted to come; and Papa would have let her, and wouldn't have gone to see Queen Elizabeth unless she had been invited too.\\\"\\n\\nJoan wished she had not mentioned Shakespeare.  There had surely been others; men who had climbed up and carried their impossible wives with them.  But she couldn't think of one, just then.\\n\\n\\\"We must help her,\\\" she answered somewhat lamely.  \\\"She's anxious to learn, I know.\\\"\\n\\nThe child shook her head.  \\\"She doesn't understand,\\\" she said. \\\"And Papa won't tell her.  He says it would only hurt her and do no good.\\\"  The small hands were clenched.  \\\"I shall hate her if she spoils his life.\\\"\\n\\nThe atmosphere was becoming tragic.  Joan felt the need of escaping from it.  She sprang up.\\n\\n\\\"Oh, don't be nonsensical,\\\" she said.  \\\"Your father isn't the only man married to a woman not as clever as himself.  He isn't going to let that stop him.  And your mother's going to learn to be the wife of a great man and do the best she can.  And if they don't like her they've got to put up with her.  I shall talk to the both of them.\\\" A wave of motherliness towards the entire Phillips family passed over her.  It included Hilda.  She caught the child to her and gave her a hug.  \\\"You go back to school,\\\" she said, \\\"and get on as fast as you can, so that you'll be able to be useful to him.\\\"\\n\\nThe child flung her arms about her.  \\\"You're so beautiful and wonderful,\\\" she said.  \\\"You can do anything.  I'm so glad you came.\\\"\\n\\nJoan laughed.  It was surprising how easily the problem had been solved.  She would take Mrs. Phillips in hand at once.  At all events she should be wholesome and unobtrusive.  It would be a delicate mission, but Joan felt sure of her own tact.  She could see his boyish eyes turned upon her with wonder and gratitude.\\n\\n\\\"I was so afraid you would not be back before I went,\\\" said the child.  \\\"I ought to have gone this afternoon, but Papa let me stay till the evening.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You will help?\\\" she added, fixing on Joan her great, grave eyes.\\n\\nJoan promised, and the child went out.  She looked pretty when she smiled.  She closed the door behind her noiselessly.\\n\\nIt occurred to Joan that she would like to talk matters over with Greyson.  There was \\\"Clorinda's\\\" attitude to be decided upon; and she was interested to know what view he himself would take.  Of course he would be on P-'s side.  The Evening Gazette had always supported the \\\"gas and water school\\\" of socialism; and to include the people's food was surely only an extension of the principle. She rang him up and Miss Greyson answered, asking her to come round to dinner:  they would be alone.  And she agreed.\\n\\nThe Greysons lived in a small house squeezed into an angle of the Outer Circle, overlooking Regent's Park.  It was charmingly furnished, chiefly with old Chippendale.  The drawing-room made quite a picture.  It was home-like and restful with its faded colouring, and absence of all show and overcrowding.  They sat there after dinner and discussed Joan's news.  Miss Greyson was repairing a piece of old embroidery she had brought back with her from Italy; and Greyson sat smoking, with his hands behind his head, and his long legs stretched out towards the fire.\\n\\n\\\"Carleton will want him to make his food policy include Tariff Reform,\\\" he said.  \\\"If he prove pliable, and is willing to throw over his free trade principles, all well and good.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What's Carleton got to do with it?\\\" demanded Joan with a note of indignation.\\n\\nHe turned his head towards her with an amused raising of the eyebrows.  \\\"Carleton owns two London dailies,\\\" he answered, \\\"and is in treaty for a third:  together with a dozen others scattered about the provinces.  Most politicians find themselves, sooner or later, convinced by his arguments.  Phillips may prove the exception.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It would be rather interesting, a fight between them,\\\" said Joan. \\\"Myself I should back Phillips.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"He might win through,\\\" mused Greyson.  \\\"He's the man to do it, if anybody could.  But the odds will be against him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't see it,\\\" said Joan, with decision.\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid you haven't yet grasped the power of the Press,\\\" he answered with a smile.  \\\"Phillips speaks occasionally to five thousand people.  Carleton addresses every day a circle of five million readers.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, but when Phillips does speak, he speaks to the whole country,\\\" retorted Joan.\\n\\n\\\"Through the medium of Carleton and his like; and just so far as they allow his influence to permeate beyond the platform,\\\" answered Greyson.\\n\\n\\\"But they report his speeches.  They are bound to,\\\" explained Joan.\\n\\n\\\"It doesn't read quite the same,\\\" he answered.  \\\"Phillips goes home under the impression that he has made a great success and has roused the country.  He and millions of other readers learn from the next morning's headlines that it was 'A Tame Speech' that he made.  What sounded to him 'Loud Cheers' have sunk to mild 'Hear, Hears.'  That five minutes' hurricane of applause, during which wildly excited men and women leapt upon the benches and roared themselves hoarse, and which he felt had settled the whole question, he searches for in vain.  A few silly interjections, probably pre-arranged by Carleton's young lions, become 'renewed interruptions.'  The report is strictly truthful; but the impression produced is that Robert Phillips has failed to carry even his own people with him.  And then follow leaders in fourteen widely-circulated Dailies, stretching from the Clyde to the Severn, foretelling how Mr. Robert Phillips could regain his waning popularity by the simple process of adopting Tariff Reform:  or whatever the pet panacea of Carleton and Co. may, at the moment, happen to be.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't make us out all alike,\\\" pleaded his sister with a laugh. \\\"There are still a few old-fashioned papers that do give their opponents fair play.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They are not increasing in numbers,\\\" he answered, \\\"and the Carleton group is.  There is no reason why in another ten years he should not control the entire popular press of the country.  He's got the genius and he's got the means.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The cleverest thing he has done,\\\" he continued, turning to Joan, \\\"is your Sunday Post.  Up till then, the working classes had escaped him.  With the Sunday Post, he has solved the problem. They open their mouths; and he gives them their politics wrapped up in pictures and gossipy pars.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Greyson rose and put away her embroidery.  \\\"But what's his object?\\\" she said.  \\\"He must have more money than he can spend; and he works like a horse.  I could understand it, if he had any beliefs.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, we can all persuade ourselves that we are the Heaven-ordained dictator of the human race,\\\" he answered.  \\\"Love of power is at the bottom of it.  Why do our Rockefellers and our Carnegies condemn themselves to the existence of galley slaves, ruining their digestions so that they never can enjoy a square meal.  It isn't the money; it's the trouble of their lives how to get rid of that. It is the notoriety, the power that they are out for.  In Carleton's case, it is to feel himself the power behind the throne; to know that he can make and unmake statesmen; has the keys of peace and war in his pocket; is able to exclaim:  Public opinion? It is I.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It can be a respectable ambition,\\\" suggested Joan.\\n\\n\\\"It has been responsible for most of man's miseries,\\\" he answered. \\\"Every world's conqueror meant to make it happy after he had finished knocking it about.  We are all born with it, thanks to the devil.\\\"  He shifted his position and regarded her with critical eyes.  \\\"You've got it badly,\\\" he said.  \\\"I can see it in the tilt of your chin and the quivering of your nostrils.  You beware of it.\\\"\\n\\nMiss Greyson left them.  She had to finish an article.  They debated \\\"Clorinda's\\\" views; and agreed that, as a practical housekeeper, she would welcome attention being given to the question of the nation's food.  The Evening Gazette would support Phillips in principle, while reserving to itself the right of criticism when it came to details.\\n\\n\\\"What's he like in himself?\\\" he asked her.  \\\"You've been seeing something of him, haven't you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, a little,\\\" she answered.  \\\"He's absolutely sincere; and he means business.  He won't stop at the bottom of the ladder now he's once got his foot upon it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But he's quite common, isn't he?\\\" he asked again.  \\\"I've only met him in public.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, that's precisely what he isn't,\\\" answered Joan.  \\\"You feel that he belongs to no class, but his own.  The class of the Abraham Lincolns, and the Dantons.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"England's a different proposition,\\\" he mused.  \\\"Society counts for so much with us.  I doubt if we should accept even an Abraham Lincoln:  unless in some supreme crisis.  His wife rather handicaps him, too, doesn't she?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She wasn't born to be the chatelaine of Downing Street,\\\" Joan admitted.  \\\"But it's not an official position.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm not so sure that it isn't,\\\" he laughed.  \\\"It's the dinner- table that rules in England.  We settle everything round a dinner- table.\\\"\\n\\nShe was sitting in front of the fire in a high-backed chair.  She never cared to loll, and the shaded light from the electric sconces upon the mantelpiece illumined her.\\n\\n\\\"If the world were properly stage-managed, that's what you ought to be,\\\" he said, \\\"the wife of a Prime Minister.  I can see you giving such an excellent performance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I must talk to Mary,\\\" he added, \\\"see if we can't get you off on some promising young Under Secretary.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't give me ideas above my station,\\\" laughed Joan.  \\\"I'm a journalist.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's the pity of it,\\\" he said.  \\\"You're wasting the most important thing about you, your personality.  You would do more good in a drawing-room, influencing the rulers, than you will ever do hiding behind a pen.  It was the drawing-room that made the French Revolution.\\\"\\n\\nThe firelight played about her hair.  \\\"I suppose every woman dreams of reviving the old French Salon,\\\" she answered.  \\\"They must have been gloriously interesting.\\\"  He was leaning forward with clasped hands.  \\\"Why shouldn't she?\\\" he said.  \\\"The reason that our drawing-rooms have ceased to lead is that our beautiful women are generally frivolous and our clever women unfeminine.  What we are waiting for is an English Madame Roland.\\\"\\n\\nJoan laughed.  \\\"Perhaps I shall some day,\\\" she answered.\\n\\nHe insisted on seeing her as far as the bus.  It was a soft, mild night; and they walked round the Circle to Gloucester Gate.  He thought there would be more room in the buses at that point.\\n\\n\\\"I wish you would come oftener,\\\" he said.  \\\"Mary has taken such a liking to you.  If you care to meet people, we can always whip up somebody of interest.\\\"\\n\\nShe promised that she would.  She always felt curiously at home with the Greysons.\\n\\nThey were passing the long sweep of Chester Terrace.  \\\"I like this neighbourhood with its early Victorian atmosphere,\\\" she said.  \\\"It always makes me feel quiet and good.  I don't know why.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I like the houses, too,\\\" he said.  \\\"There's a character about them.  You don't often find such fine drawing-rooms in London.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't forget your promise,\\\" he reminded her, when they parted.  \\\"I shall tell Mary she may write to you.\\\"\\n\\nShe met Carleton by chance a day or two later, as she was entering the office.  \\\"I want to see you,\\\" he said; and took her up with him into his room.\\n\\n\\\"We must stir the people up about this food business,\\\" he said, plunging at once into his subject.  \\\"Phillips is quite right.  It overshadows everything.  We must make the country self-supporting. It can be done and must.  If a war were to be sprung upon us we could be starved out in a month.  Our navy, in face of these new submarines, is no longer able to secure us.  France is working day and night upon them.  It may be a bogey, or it may not.  If it isn't, she would have us at her mercy; and it's too big a risk to run.  You live in the same house with him, don't you?  Do you often see him?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not often,\\\" she answered.\\n\\nHe was reading a letter.  \\\"You were dining there on Friday night, weren't you?\\\" he asked her, without looking up.\\n\\nJoan flushed.  What did he mean by cross-examining her in this way? She was not at all used to impertinence from the opposite sex.\\n\\n\\\"Your information is quite correct,\\\" she answered.\\n\\nHer anger betrayed itself in her tone; and he shot a swift glance at her.\\n\\n\\\"I didn't mean to offend you,\\\" he said.  \\\"A mutual friend, a Mr. Airlie, happened to be of the party, and he mentioned you.\\\"\\n\\nHe threw aside the letter.  \\\"I'll tell you what I want you to do,\\\" he said.  \\\"It's nothing to object to.  Tell him that you've seen me and had a talk.  I understand his scheme to be that the country should grow more and more food until it eventually becomes self- supporting; and that the Government should control the distribution.  Tell him that with that I'm heart and soul in sympathy; and would like to help him.\\\"  He pushed aside a pile of papers and, leaning across the desk, spoke with studied deliberation.  \\\"If he can see his way to making his policy dependent upon Protection, we can work together.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And if he can't?\\\" suggested Joan.\\n\\nHe fixed his large, colourless eyes upon her.  \\\"That's where you can help him,\\\" he answered.  \\\"If he and I combine forces, we can pull this through in spite of the furious opposition that it is going to arouse.  Without a good Press he is helpless; and where is he going to get his Press backing if he turns me down?  From half a dozen Socialist papers whose support will do him more harm than good.  If he will bring the working class over to Protection I will undertake that the Tariff Reformers and the Agricultural Interest shall accept his Socialism.  It will be a victory for both of us.\\n\\n\\\"If he gain his end, what do the means matter?\\\" he continued, as Joan did not answer.  \\\"Food may be dearer; the Unions can square that by putting up wages; while the poor devil of a farm labourer will at last get fair treatment.  We can easily insist upon that. What do you think, yourself?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"About Protection,\\\" she answered.  \\\"It's one of the few subjects I haven't made up my mind about.\\\"\\n\\nHe laughed.  \\\"You will find all your pet reforms depend upon it, when you come to work them out,\\\" he said.  \\\"You can't have a minimum wage without a minimum price.\\\"\\n\\nThey had risen.\\n\\n\\\"I'll give him your message,\\\" said Joan.  \\\"But I don't see him exchanging his principles even for your support.  I admit it's important.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Talk it over with him,\\\" he said.  \\\"And bear this in mind for your own guidance.\\\"  He took a step forward, which brought his face quite close to hers:  \\\"If he fails, and all his life's work goes for nothing, I shall be sorry; but I shan't break my heart.  He will.\\\"\\n\\nJoan dropped a note into Phillips's letter-box on her return home, saying briefly that she wished to see him; and he sent up answer asking her if she would come to the gallery that evening, and meet him after his speech, which would be immediately following the dinner hour.\\n\\nIt was the first time he had risen since his appointment, and he was received with general cheers.  He stood out curiously youthful against the background of grey-haired and bald-headed men behind him; and there was youth also in his clear, ringing voice that not even the vault-like atmosphere of that shadowless chamber could altogether rob of its vitality.  He spoke simply and good- humouredly, without any attempt at rhetoric, relying chiefly upon a crescendo of telling facts that gradually, as he proceeded, roused the House to that tense stillness that comes to it when it begins to think.\\n\\n\\\"A distinctly dangerous man,\\\" Joan overheard a little old lady behind her comment to a friend.  \\\"If I didn't hate him, I should like him.\\\"\\n\\nHe met her in the corridor, and they walked up and down and talked, too absorbed to be aware of the curious eyes that were turned upon them.  Joan gave him Carleton's message.\\n\\n\\\"It was clever of him to make use of you,\\\" he said.  \\\"If he'd sent it through anybody else, I'd have published it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You don't think it even worth considering?\\\" suggested Joan.\\n\\n\\\"Protection?\\\" he flashed out scornfully.  \\\"Yes, I've heard of that. I've listened, as a boy, while the old men told of it to one another, in thin, piping voices, round the fireside; how the labourers were flung eight-and-sixpence a week to die on, and the men starved in the towns; while the farmers kept their hunters, and got drunk each night on fine old crusted port.  Do you know what their toast was in the big hotels on market day, with the windows open to the street:  'To a long war and a bloody one.'  It would be their toast to-morrow, if they had their way.  Does he think I am going to be a party to the putting of the people's neck again under their pitiless yoke?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But the people are more powerful now,\\\" argued Joan.  \\\"If the farmer demanded higher prices, they could demand higher wages.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They would never overtake the farmer,\\\" he answered, with a laugh. \\\"And the last word would always be with him.  I am out to get rid of the landlords,\\\" he continued, \\\"not to establish them as the permanent rulers of the country, as they are in Germany.  The people are more powerful--just a little, because they are no longer dependent on the land.  They can say to the farmer, 'All right, my son, if that's your figure, I'm going to the shop next door--to South America, to Canada, to Russia.'  It isn't a satisfactory solution.  I want to see England happy and healthy before I bother about the Argentine.  It drives our men into the slums when they might be living fine lives in God's fresh air.  In the case of war it might be disastrous.  There, I agree with him.  We must be able to shut our door without fear of having to open it ourselves to ask for bread.  How would Protection accomplish that?  Did he tell you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Don't eat me,\\\" laughed Joan.  \\\"I haven't been sent to you as a missionary.  I'm only a humble messenger.  I suppose the argument is that, good profits assured to him, the farmer would bustle up and produce more.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Can you see him bustling up?\\\" he answered with a laugh; \\\"organizing himself into a body, and working the thing out from the point of view of the public weal?  I'll tell you what nine-tenths of him would do:  grow just as much or little as suited his own purposes; and then go to sleep.  And Protection would be his security against ever being awakened.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I'm afraid you don't like him,\\\" Joan commented.\\n\\n\\\"He will be all right in his proper place,\\\" he answered:  \\\"as the servant of the public:  told what to do, and turned out of his job if h\",\"timestamp\":1639210346,\"title\":\"\\nThe child raised her eyes.
