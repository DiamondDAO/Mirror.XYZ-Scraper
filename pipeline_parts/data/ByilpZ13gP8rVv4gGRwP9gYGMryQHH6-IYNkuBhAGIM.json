And DAI has been live since 2017.\\n\\nThe fast growth in UST comes as the Terra blockchain has become a [major player in the decentralized finance](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/30/ust-stablecoin-demand-defi-incentives-drive-terras-luna-to-new-all-time-high/) ([DeFi](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/what-is-defi/)) sector, where stablecoins play a critical role in staking, liquidity management and yield-generating.\\n\\nTerra’s LUNA token [has been one of the top performers](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/24/defi-value-on-terra-surges-to-record-21b-as-luna-tops-100/) among all digital assets this year, jumping 15-fold in price to a reported market capitalization of $34 billion, according to the crypto data site Messari.\\n\\nLast week, [Terra overtook Binance Smart Chain](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/12/21/terra-becomes-second-largest-defi-protocol-surpassing-binance-smart-chain/) (BSC) for second place in total value locked (TVL), a metric used to compare the DeFi activity occurring on various blockchains or for individual projects.
