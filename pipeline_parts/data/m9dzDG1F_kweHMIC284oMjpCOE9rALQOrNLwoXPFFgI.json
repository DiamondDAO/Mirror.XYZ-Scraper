"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I stumbled into the cave via a twitter, via a twitter, via a twitter.  Isn’t that how most crypto stumbles upon happen?  An OHMie, just reading other OHMie posts, and somehow, I really don’t remember now, I was led… ok let’s not be dramatic I just clicked on a message that led me to really, really, really, want entrance into the discord of this CONCAVE server.  And after many failed attempts, I got in.  I had no idea what to expect other than I think it had something to do with people associated with OHM so I was willing to diver deeper.  Into the CAVE.  And so I did.  \\n\\nRead other posts for roles and what to do once you enter into this world of inclusion, peace, helpfulness… my interest was in the DIVE.. why are we here?  What is this all for?  I quickly realized only WE determine that why.  There may be a layout, a groundwork, just like my walk everyday is grounded, but what is around, above, below..\\n\\nConcave helped me to remember that.  As above, so below.  But that’s another story.. Concave got me really thinking.  How can this be applied to the state of DEFI, to OHM, to crypto as a whole?  And then I saw others piling in ideas that WE are the base for all to be achieved.  In honor, in co-opetition and collaboration.  \\n\\nI dove deeper because it was all going exactly in line with my understanding that life is, how we know it, just a game. Not to say you can or can’t take it seriously, but it is a game.  You decide how you want to play it.  \\n\\nPlay it with integrity.  Or play it like a fool.  But it’s okay because in the cave, you can realize your foolishness as a troll, and all will be okay.  We are all the same, no one is better than another.  I’m not good at making MEME’s or have the humor, sometimes I wish I did, but then I realize, we all have our roles.  And those surveyors, wow, they are incredible.  I belong in the world of research because I love the history and made up believe history that shapes our world.  We all have our roles in the game.  Just like any game, you may be the scorer, the rebounder, the defender, but in the end you can play all roles, but you can really shine in one.  \\n\\nConcave is bringing people together to bring out the best in them.  We all have something to give.  And this is the power in numbers.  We are powerful once we know we ‘have power’ but we are even more powerful once we know we can unite and use these powers for good.  That is the mission here.  We have the power to do this.  We have the power to do anything with good intent, and with all in mind.\\n\\nWe all have a part to play in this game.  Where do you fit best? If you’re not sure, it’s okay.  Jump in the spoon and see what happens.  If we all just take that leap, WAGMI.  \",\"timestamp\":1638156546,\"title\":\"Concave: The Genesis\"},\"digest\":\"YQE6mFWPz9OqQpEYAVbmc_GocLmCI5Ior4RYpu5f5fg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x49871414426D6dA8A45138E78174852232E5972a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mORPHaZpyoybfGNLdosPuK_OqIRqXA7sSzs_EL0yJZ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X1o-Hd6a22MAPrJ73YrjEr6Vs55s_rZCTaUO-PiqtJU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"iIJj3ilUiD8w_pLlXUxqSMsHkdzYM00JsWDHllTIPTrMJ3aJMtnC-PQkx0qOAkhxd8UdnJXto3QRzfVgUvvpmg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc809d7051701609f9f7ed96c0869ffb6127ca9864f377e062cd04d4b54036710443deed79cc27b57bbb81a7c7247670efd951425faaab4b66bd593cec3413fed00\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"mORPHaZpyoybfGNLdosPuK_OqIRqXA7sSzs_EL0yJZ8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"X1o-Hd6a22MAPrJ73YrjEr6Vs55s_rZCTaUO-PiqtJU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"YQE6mFWPz9OqQpEYAVbmc_GocLmCI5Ior4RYpu5f5fg\"}"
