Scattering supplies and valuables as bait to exploit enemy greed has been historically successful. Making a move or decision for any reason besides “this will lead to victory” is an exploitable mistake. Sima Yi held steady despite Zhuge Liang’s taunting him with a dress.\\n\\nActing on FOMO, or any emotion, is undisciplined. Boiled down, having FOMO implies that one is unfulfilled. One is not content with oneself; some external factor is aggravating an internal dissatisfaction. If the dissatisfaction weren’t there, the external factor would have no hold on me.\\n\\nThis reminds me of a passage from the Dao De Jing:\\n\\n> Be content with what you have;\\n> rejoice in the way things are.\\n> When you realize there is nothing lacking,\\n> the whole world belongs to you.\\n\\nThis is interesting to me, because my understanding of my societal narrative holds that only the chronically dissatisfied are high-achievers. Yet it appears that (and this is also prompted by my finishing *Grit* by Angela Duckworth) with any meaningful endeavor in life, effective striving in the long-run is done best with a respectful and supportive emotional headspace.\\n\\nI’ll think more about this one.\",\"timestamp\":1637286449,\"title\":\"the nature of FOMO\"},\"digest\":\"DrfdqubQto-bQru2Zaz3pTl9pgRXCgh6luGj6Uto-5U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xdF3AB3adB9F679d71b9A22ab77565b1FF3A5047D\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JiuWO731F3bhDAPMgNFNaovDkRTPSt89uP_9frEql4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bHF0APHB54AF9Lt0UPWhYOciyTUJwUKTBwpcE4mjYro\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"w4Bkdz3J8gDkV1ap9FnqH6Xqw-6DLcfS5U-MvlfLBjM4Ay9ADmFWEhIsufeq0xbA90bW1JosHWfjsJQLmB-b_A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5d28cfb46ae00586cde083af70323f43855092c0ab6403c2049f42d6f7ca2855148b0dda9ab0cac84ccd995819f56cedb97f4329985c48b048942ea50300b171b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_JiuWO731F3bhDAPMgNFNaovDkRTPSt89uP_9frEql4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"bHF0APHB54AF9Lt0UPWhYOciyTUJwUKTBwpcE4mjYro\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kAI9Myt-hKkcIRb4UrLIOPTTrutxQ0kWF7FcplmKue4\"}"
