"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"1976\\n\\n8\\\\.4.1 Weird Experiments Can Change The World\\n\\n1976\\n\\nIt was a place created to do weird research and experiments.\\n\\nSRI - Stanford Research Institute - is a nonprofit research institute, imagined in the 20s, launched in 1946 by Stanford University Trustees.\\n\\nIts official mission was to support economic development in California. It’s also where its small weird research changed the world’s norms.\\n\\nA list of some of SRI’s work:\\n\\nSubstitute for rubber plants during WW2, a coconut oil substitute in soap (for “Tide” detergent), theme park feasibililty (for Disneyland), Technicolor, automated check processing, and one of the first autonomous robots. ESP, speech recognition and translation, and telesurgery.\\n\\nSRI’s most famous work, weird and world-changing, made the “Web”.\\n\\nIn the 1960s, they came up with “oN-Line System (NLS)”, a basket of modern personal computing technologies: bit-mapped displays, collaboration software, hypertext, what later became a “mouse”, “inkjet” printers, optical disks, LCDs, and magnetic core memory.\\n\\nIn December 1969, they built the first wide area network to use “packet switching” to connect mainframes from different universities and offices, the ARPANET - it had 4 nodes. The age of information trapped by distance and geography was ending.\\n\\nIn 1976, they went further. A message was sent from a computer terminal, in the back of a California former biker bar, carried by a cable to a van parked in front, that used radio to send the data 3,000 miles through ARPANET to a computer in Boston.\\n\\nThis experiment proved that a network could be created to go beyond ARPANET’s limited network, with “Internetworking” - the term was shortened later to “Internet”. 10 years later SRI got the 8th “.com” domain in the brand new Internet.\\n\\nOne SRI spinoff is on everyone’s iPhone: SIRI.\\n\\n[https://open.spotify.com/track/7ynwkFhXbrQqnMIWqFfRUS?si=daf8ce64e6664ffd](https://open.spotify.com/track/7ynwkFhXbrQqnMIWqFfRUS?si=daf8ce64e6664ffd)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/QLdSDyYVEPpIti-xt24k6.png?height=1612&width=1201)\\n\\n**1976 3.4.2**\\n\\n**2776 The Collar Orbital Departure Lounge**\\n\\n8\\\\.4.1 Weird Experiments Can Change The World\\n\\n2776 Mars, Skyhook transport to “The Collar”\\n\\nI was on my way to “The High Laboratories”, riding the Skyhook to the Collar, the orbital home to some of the most revered places of Mars. It was a name that was a deep part of the myth of Martian history.\\n\\nThe “HiLab” had many of its locations, on and offworld, but its most famous was its first facility, still in orbit as part-Museum and HQ.\\n\\nThe orignal ancient orbital habitat became the core of a larger platform, which accumulated years later, like a pearl formed around a bit of sand.\\n\\nThe Lab was part of a cluster of early research facilities from the days of the first colonies. The “HiLab” has since become a kingmaker, by training and grooming the best and brightest of Mars for leadership, and where one candidate was chosen for the “DecaPact” competition.\\n\\nThe “DecaPact” used to be an informal competition of the best minds and imaginations from across the Solar System.\\n\\nIt became a contest for leadership of the System when some of its more famous champions went on to become leaders.\\n\\nThe “Deca” went from informality to formality. It became a pressure valve used by the tribes of humanity for leadership of the System. Every decade, candidates were selected by the powerbrokers of the System for the “DecaPact”. All candidates formed the “Council of the System”, with one of its members chosen as its head for a decade.\\n\\nAs long as that leadership was fair-minded, the System was content to let each tribe have its chance to lead for a decade. It worked for a long time.\\n\\nA long streak of competent leadership was overshadowed by ambition.\\nTensions were growing over the last few decades, with open talk of war.\\n\\nThis made me wonder why did the High Laboratories of Mars choose me from more powerful, popular, and influential candidates?\\n\\nThat was the biggest reason I went, aside from my Dad’s pride and urging. Why me? What is the powers-that-be see in me? I have to find out.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/nv8GwCABJgStIFLAq2Wct.png?height=1612&width=1201)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641946370,\"title\":\"1976: 3.4 Weird Experiments Can Change The World\"},\"digest\":\"JHdHfEniDezEWuQcSRu4t01EGawIpWBZTQB3aQDDPXc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"h1tjfEGnJR8kHN0CGwGBSPiKWTma9B42fG0fS6KljtoM_zRh95rHU2n9p-BOlgCZBeIWVlRXRDw9L41Imi2nCw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x939c3e74a74214d6af1d91162bfa0388ffcf1810af9855b8880f77fac5246e92763b9303b41ee3fbd48236f8d0f8e555ab6e872cb7d0c6983323d6d9cc5c151c1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"zPVtMyaQpDsDDVMjJesiMZMonuGdwDy-z4GiCoW285I\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Sj1MexBfn8IhGL2V2t3MueP6MdvJoUFmyRgdO4ow8wQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tTz94a5UO8vOVirZANhRlHzbjYYIs5na9TSjp-h2TLM\"}"
