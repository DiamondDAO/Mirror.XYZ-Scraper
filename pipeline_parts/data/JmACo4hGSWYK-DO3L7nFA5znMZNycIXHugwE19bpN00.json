Welcome, PoolGrants!\\n\\nThis proposal has been community led throughout the whole process and will continue being managed by active community members moving forward.\\n\\n## What are grants?\\n\\nGrant programs have gained a lot of traction lately with protocols like Uniswap, Compound & AAVE all recently launching their own in order to create an efficient method of funding protocol development. The grants awarded by these committees will vary, but the overarching goal is to enable ***contributors to contribute.***\\n\\n## Why PoolGrants?\\n\\nWe launched this effort with a focus on enabling the entire user base, with its wide range of talents, to contribute those skills to the protocol in their own ways-whatever those ways are! Our approach to achieving that goal is to offer users the option to apply for Micro Grants in addition to proposals that require much more attention. These will serve as the on-ramp for the less involved, smaller budget proposals in an effort to be accessible by the entire userbase.\\n\\n(Time allocated to these “micro” sized proposals will vary by quarter.)\\n\\n## Where and how to…\\n\\nOur [Application](https://www.notion.so/poolgrants/PoolTogether-Grant-Application-86140e23ca474351a7ea8cc13d46b5e4) is Live Today and we are ready to start receiving your proposals. Below is a list of some of the areas we expect those might focus on but we welcome any and all ideas!\\n\\nAdditional inspiration can be gained from our ongoing list of [RFPs](https://www.notion.so/poolgrants/Request-for-proposals-RFPs-cdc1aed8e3854e85a4401dbc1f6776b9) too.\\n\\n* Protocol development (including core PoolTogether protocol development, development of higher layer protocols which use the PoolTogether protocol)\\n* Applications and integrations (front-ends and other applications/yield sources that use PoolTogether protocol)\\n* Developer tooling\\n* Marketing and educational\\n* Referral incentive programs\\n* Committees, sub-committees, and DAOs that serve the PoolTogether ecosystem\\n* Code audits\",\"timestamp\":1634692750,\"title\":\"PoolTogether.com Grants Committee | PoolGrants\"},\"digest\":\"r3atrJ0kv7U5494D7i6jkTtQtX4EeQSPUSNAaaMOglY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6E9A88971e957Abb41bAe4E2677caE258F0c1e76\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5ZT51J96-HnG3ARRPfHV8zKBaXIQ_bssg9B02S3SnyY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"uzhXlw3MuNviIo-qKHOCoii03Sp4CFHorWhnVRWzs4k\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"flcnYvUqVVvUoxPOqguicRWK7xAJqOTsPnTDCknZHj6UWW9pdU62ecDKBI_ZqeonLU7W81mvZcOOtQEu0o_QFQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x51c1aa8376db7c36e756d93c9f788d61e1b362de1fd8c0b1c114b92ed3c765677570047ee52ca4c78a2a02b6794231309790f7d0e4f2b1e59de9c8fe9e122dcc1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"5ZT51J96-HnG3ARRPfHV8zKBaXIQ_bssg9B02S3SnyY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"uzhXlw3MuNviIo-qKHOCoii03Sp4CFHorWhnVRWzs4k\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"r3atrJ0kv7U5494D7i6jkTtQtX4EeQSPUSNAaaMOglY\"}"
