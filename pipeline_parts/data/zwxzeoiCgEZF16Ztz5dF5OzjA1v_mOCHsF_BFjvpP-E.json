"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Historically, giving to a charity was looked at as alms giving. Money was given directly to the needy to help meet basic needs such as food and clothing. Before the 1900s, organized charitable funding organizations did not exist (Kirsch Foundation). “The Christian notion of charity giving is unquestionably the strongest single influence in the rise of the West’s unique tradition of giving, caring, and philanthropy” (Guinness 2001, 108).\\n\\nDuring the industrial age, entrepreneurs helped move the idea of alms giving to what is known today as **charity**. Social problems were the focus of newly established foundations such as the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and Carnegie Foundation (Kirsch Foundation). The next shift of thinking came with the introduction of wealth in the late 1990s from the technology boom. Individuals, such as Bill Gates, had accumulated massive personal wealth and decided to use some of that wealth to address social problems through charitable giving.\\n\\nAngel Protocol aims to leverage the yield mechanism of Anchor Protocol’s target earning functionality of 20% on UST deposits to create perpetual charity endowments. When users donate, they will choose what percent of their donation they want to go to the charity immediately, which will be sent to the charity’s Anchor “Immediate Giving” account. The remaining amount will be deposited in the charity’s Anchor “Perpetual Giving” account. The Perpetual Giving account will transfer funds annually at a 15% rate to the charity’s “Immediate Giving” account. The remaining 5% will be held to compound the savings investment balance. \\n\\nCharitable giving is vital to the stability of the nonprofit sector. The nonprofit sector is a vital economic source in many regions around the world. “If the nonprofit sector throughout the world was a separate national economy, it would be the world’s eighth largest economy” (Salamon and Anheier 1999). \\n\\nThe following section shows an overview of how the nonprofit and charitable sector represents a significant, highly diverse component of the U.S. economy. \\n\\nTable 1 presents information on the number of nonprofit and charitable organizations as of July, 2009. Of the 1.5 million registered nonprofit organizations, nearly 64% are public charities. Nearly 8% are private foundations, while 29% are other types of nonprofits. Only 52% of registered charities file Form 990. Non-filers include qualifying religious organizations, small organizations, and organizations that may no longer exist but have not been removed from the IRS Business Master File (BMF). Very little information is available regarding non-filing organizations. \\n\\nMeasuring employment in the nonprofit and charitable sector is not an easy task. There is no government agency that regularly collects systematic employment data on the nonprofit sector. There are two major studies that have attempted to measure employment in the nonprofit and charitable sector in recent years. \\n\\nTable 2 provides estimates of nonprofit employment by industry. More than half of nonprofit employment (approximately 54%) is involved in health care and social assistance. In 1998, nearly 23% of nonprofit employees were involved in other services. This proportion fell by 2005 to just over 21%. In both 1998 and 2005, approximately 18% of nonprofit employees provided educational services. Arts, entertainment, and recreation was the fourth largest category, with nearly 4% of all nonprofit employment within this category. \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/uaAqvx8kedAXVlQrk0Nty.jpeg?height=2000&width=3000)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638351830,\"title\":\"Angel Protocol’s Mission to Aid those in need and Improve Quality of Life\"},\"digest\":\"xmOFK0xTMn5ZS3cP-2QpyeUvzS9KqnZErYRV8-8LtC4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xc59224f65FD3E9e2c8f929D1167c6B95c8C284FE\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1LH4FgPa96UtBdJ23Fli7m4stiJHxXmnpp5HGSxt_Do\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2JJ0LC61HYCkjDVcM5fEXeC2CWeCSk-7LJSf0FySwlo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"uqZdmkRRV481SbQe_X9g4jx3dLZBLMRtKV_FzU3d91_U10HGDtqny_8Ajj4HrA3IBQyNXCCUs0IFRmXQm2tE0w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x319760fea6e27cf02c98fa7a534f0bf9cf8e54161e89dc138ebada9a778e543b592aa82e14b848b170fc8e6766472b31448cc633c3e40762d1c2c45c7464cc2d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"1LH4FgPa96UtBdJ23Fli7m4stiJHxXmnpp5HGSxt_Do\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2JJ0LC61HYCkjDVcM5fEXeC2CWeCSk-7LJSf0FySwlo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xmOFK0xTMn5ZS3cP-2QpyeUvzS9KqnZErYRV8-8LtC4\"}"
