"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is taking action against the American CryptoFed DAO, which claims to be the first decentralized autonomous organization in Wyoming, and its planned tokens. Because of the \\\"misleading\\\" statement in its registration documents. The SEC announced that it had begun an administrative lawsuit against the company, resulting in the freezing of the registration of its tokens Locke and Ducat. It is reported that CryptoFed filed an S-1 document with the SEC in September this year, formally seeking to obtain the approval of the federal agency. When submitting the S-1 document, the organizer of the DAO claimed that these tokens were not securities and sought to register as utility tokens with the institution. CryptoFed intends to distribute tokens, but restricts its transactions and transfers. The planned registration is based on the guidelines set out in the latest draft token safe harbor proposal by the SEC's crypto-friendly commissioner Hester Peirce. However, the SEC has not officially recognized this registration path, and it is still a proposal rather than a guide.\",\"timestamp\":1636573163,\"title\":\"U.S. SEC suspends token registration of American CryptoFed DAO\"},\"digest\":\"HICMulPggccM1PRXO884BRFJflT0hS0KSxD41RYE8lM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xD4203e6fFC798765Dea121D795b2a56684c1c738\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gzV9DwpXFRbaopxD1ImE4WShlcCjSeRlh_zGL35zw2U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qOoyGqWPwFI0NQPrakbDAQh_1Xn-pTr-1Wt80H3qTLE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4sDVy-CpRakewZ_lRcQ2uuk7IaSBQmYoHu8r34VT-CUKp3azD30payr0BxTU0P-dxNwrL9s-v5jm1ZEYx0ZYGw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc2b35a43bec3a8945fc7dbc11d65307da9998b842831e5eecd6bb80b85daab8a281258cf4da4075e0fbb9fc1d66aeaf65db631a43619e67045763506006f95941c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"gzV9DwpXFRbaopxD1ImE4WShlcCjSeRlh_zGL35zw2U\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qOoyGqWPwFI0NQPrakbDAQh_1Xn-pTr-1Wt80H3qTLE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"HICMulPggccM1PRXO884BRFJflT0hS0KSxD41RYE8lM\"}"
