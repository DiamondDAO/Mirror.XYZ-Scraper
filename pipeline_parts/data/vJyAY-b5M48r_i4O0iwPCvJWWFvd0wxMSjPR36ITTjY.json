"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"## What can you actually do with my money?\\n\\nHere’s where we got to so far.\\n\\n1. Ξ denominated returns. Everything is benchmarked to Ξ. Deposit only Ξ into the fund. Withdraws are only in Ξ. If we take fees, they are all in Ξ. We rise and fall with Ξ.  \\n2. Max allocation of 5% (of portfolio) for each altcoin play. Do note that for yield farming, the risk allocation is actually 10% (since value deposited is doubled).\\n3. Max of 5 altcoins exposure. Very concentrated portfolio. Monitoring Discords and Twitter and trying to live a life is difficult. Let’s focus on the winners.\\n4. Options will be done in an opportunistic manner, but we will never risk more than 10% of portfolio.\\n5. \\n\\nThis is a evolving list. Let us know if there are other parameters that you think make sense to be included. \\n\\n## What are the fees?\\n\\nWe charge both a gas fee, and a performance fee.\\n\\n### Gas fee of 1%\\n\\nWhy 1%? Because we are targeting a \\\\[100\\\\] Ξ fund, so \\\\[1\\\\]% gives its \\\\[1\\\\] Ξ worth to play around with - most importantly to pay gas fees with. Why is this important? Because the mind should be focused on making the right/creative calls, than have it being too pre-occupied with gas fees.\\n\\n*But shouldn’t this fee be lower as the fund scales?*\\n\\nNo. Because gas fees are used to fund withdrawals, which .\\n\\n### Performance fee of 20% (of your profits)\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\]\\n\\n## What’s your take on leverage?\\n\\nAnyway. \\n\\n## What’s the deposit and withdrawal period\\n\\n7 days both ways. That means \\n\\nWhy both ways? The fund will aim to stay as close to its fund composition split as possible at all times. For deposits, 7 days is a long enough time for us to strategize what’s the best use of this fresh capital at this point. It is not always the best move to split it proportionally across the pools (that’s the reason for the pool ranges).\\n\\n## There’s no Telegram or Discord. Where should I go to complain and flood the chats with “wen moon”?\\n\\nSend any questions you may have to \\\\[ \\\\]. We are a small outfit. We will read all mails, but will only reply when it makes sense to. Remember, you are free to withdraw your capital anytime. As we scale, we will continue to add functionalities and features to this venture.\",\"timestamp\":1638763383,\"title\":\"Tell me more about the fund\"},\"digest\":\"zLVDlnDZalkWyOraFMWRJQ-5hyFhoMB6UhKl2UIVPXM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x17307bE3589a680452543DDe06d42A07EE3FA080\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"AuAvul_ImzZcT6GYZRr6lSUyzBckM-3edTkqzfdOjZU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GPnmWfKNMoPdnvGYf3Kzpicqr1yAcdTtS2BKPwn66tg\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"pME4lshCpzoDOKOqm7esiMWmrgo8tr87GedSHfvZvtO7G4UlqMbb9_p19p_kK0SVzULX1mwt8_y_8KimlVHiYQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x54716e76b299ab52317c384dbbf631d11e1250da8dacc93f45e357934afbb1510bdcf023ee87ad9403a3661ee4d6bf44d19799604d64c2992e7d364b84e6a42500\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"AuAvul_ImzZcT6GYZRr6lSUyzBckM-3edTkqzfdOjZU\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"GPnmWfKNMoPdnvGYf3Kzpicqr1yAcdTtS2BKPwn66tg\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ZcpU3gaxohNlLVlCvHzAVi12sZB3KngFsN46IlZbcNA\"}"
