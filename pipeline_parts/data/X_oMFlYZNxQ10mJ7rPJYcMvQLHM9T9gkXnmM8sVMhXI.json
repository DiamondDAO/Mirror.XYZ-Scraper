Sometimes better to delegate to validator with bigger commission, but this validator will do a lot for the Network, and you will get less $LUM, but price of $LUM will be more!*\\n\\nAfter you click on “**Delegate** ” button, new window will be opened:\\n\\nIn the “**Amount**” field, input 0.4 (don’t input 1, you will need some $LUM to pay for transaction!\\n\\nAfter it click on “**Continue**”, and new window will be opened:\\n\\nYou will see details of your transaction, if everything is OK, click on “**Delegate**”, and window from Keplr will be opened:\\n\\nClick on “**Approve**” in Keplr-window, wait several seconds, and you will see this:\\n\\nIf under the word “**Delegate**” you see green word “**Success**” — everything is cool! First part of $LUM-drop is received! \\n Click on “**Close**” button and scroll up, to see your new balance.\\n\\n> *You $LUM-drop will be at “**vesting balance**” that means that you can’t transfer this $LUM to any other lum-address, but you can delegate $LUM from your vesting balance to validator (or several validators, that is better for the Network) and get reward! \\n This reward will come to you “**available balance**”, and you can transfer it to any other lum-address, or re-invest it again to get more reward in future!*\\n\\nNow, let’s get second part of $LUM-drop! For this we need to vote for the proposal.\\n\\nClick on “Operations” tab in top-menu, and you will see this:\\n\\nScroll a little bit down, and you will see this:\\n\\nClick on “**Vote**” and new window will be opened:\\n\\nWe need to input number of proposal in the “**Proposal ID**” field.\\n\\n> *I don’t know, why devs of Lum-wallet did’t implement possibility to choose between possible proposals, but I hope, soon it will be)*\\n\\nTo see, which proposal is on voting now, and what is the number of proposal, go to the Lum Network block explorer: <https://www.mintscan.io/lum/proposals>\\n\\nYou will see something like this:\\n\\nOn screenshot, we can see only “**passed**” and “**rejected**” proposals. Also, proposals can be in “**deposit period**” and in “**voting period**”.\\n\\nTo get second part of $LUM-drop, we need to vote for the proposal. \\n So, we need proposal that is in “**voting period**”, but no such proposal for now. What does it means? We need to wait for a new proposal! \\n Looks like it will be #6\\n\\nAny way, now we understand how to know what is proposal number in voting period, and when you will see such proposal, just go to <https://wallet.lum.network/operations> and input number of proposal into “**Proposal ID**” field, and choose your opinion. You will have something like this:\\n\\n> *But do it only after you will see proposal in voting period!!!*\\n\\nClick on “**Continue**”:\\n\\nClick on “**Vote**”:\\n\\n“**Approve**” in Kepler and that’s all!\\n\\n> *But do it only after you will see proposal in voting period!!!*\\n\\nAfter you will see second part of $LUM-drop at your vesting balance!\\n\\nThis guide made by **[POSTHUMAN](https://twitter.com/POSTHUMAN_DVS)** validator. \\n We still don’t validate Lum Network, but we plan to do it! \\n Also, we validate many other cool networks, full list you can find here:\\n\\n## POSTHUMAN∞VALIDATOR\\n\\n### Web-page of POSTHUMAN Validator.
