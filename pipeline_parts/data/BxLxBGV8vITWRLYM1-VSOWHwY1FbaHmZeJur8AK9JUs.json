Today, we’re thrilled to announce Anoma’s first public testnet: Feigenbaum.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*ygP0CgVBnYjRuQNc)\\n\\nAnnouncing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s first public testnet\\n\\n## What is Feigenbaum?\\n\\nFeigenbaum is Anoma’s first public test network, developed and currently maintained by the team building Anoma. It is the first milestone in Anoma’s public testnet roadmap, which has been constructed to enable a progressive deployment of components and features, and to facilitate the participation of early users in testing and interacting with the implementation– thereby parallelizing the development of further features, and the gathering and integration of external user feedback.\\n\\n*Fractals* are a recurring theme in the design of Anoma, noticeable, for instance, in how the protocol upgrade mechanism works or in how Anoma’s ecosystem scales via the co-existence of many instances. Thus, Anoma’s protocol version names take inspiration from fractals, beginning with the Feigenbaum testnet, named after the [Feigenbaum attractor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_map), a deterministic fractal with a very low [Hausdorff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension) dimension.\\n\\nMore in-depth reading:\\n\\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Upgrades](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-upgrades/)\\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Fractal Scaling](https://anoma.network/blog/fractal-scaling/)\\n\\n## What features does Feigenbaum support?\\n\\nThe current version of the protocol provides an early demonstration of the intent gossip and matchmaker components in the peer-to-peer layer, which are very particular to the design of the Anoma protocol and unprecedented in the architecture of other Layer 1 blockchains. It also offers a playground for customizing and deploying validity predicates and transactions in Rust. Anoma implements proof-of-stake (PoS) as its sibyl resistance mechanism and Tendermint, a variant of the practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism (PBFT). Finally, interactions with the protocol are facilitated via the command-line interface (CLI) client, node, and wallet.\\n\\n## What can you do on Feigenbaum?\\n\\nIn addition to the basic interactions with the ledger, Feigenbaum already enables experimentation for users who might be interested in operating and directly participating in the network at mainnet launch.\\n\\nThe roles\\\\* supported are operating validator nodes, intent gossip, and matchmaking nodes. For builders that enjoy playing with Rust, we encourage them to try [customizing validity predicates](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/ledger/customize.html), transactions, or even [the matchmaker node](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/intent-gossip-and-matchmaker.html). For early end-users that are not intimidated by the command-line, it’s not too early to start with the basics, such as [setting up a wallet](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/user-guide/wallet.html) with addresses, getting some testnet tokens from the faucet account, making transfers, and staking– or, for the most adventurous ones, a primer to Anoma as a [multivariate, multivariable protocol](https://twitter.com/awasunyin/status/1422508932635967489?s=20), you can start crafting custom intents and deploying them directly to the intents gossip network.\\n\\nMore in-depth reading:\\n\\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Intent Gossip & Matchmaking system](https://anoma.network/blog/intent-gossip-and-matchmaking-system/)\\n*   [Anoma Tangram article on Validity Predicates](https://anoma.network/blog/validity-predicates/)\\n\\n\\\\*[Stay tuned](https://twitter.com/anomanetwork) for a new series of articles on our blog that explain each role in the Anoma Network!\\n\\n## How do I participate in the Feigenbaum testnet?\\n\\nAs a public, permissionless testnet, anyone can join anonymously by pulling the code from the [repository](https://github.com/anoma/anoma/releases/tag/v0.2.0) and following the instructions in the [docs](https://docs.anoma.network/v0.2.0/).\\n\\nA few members from the team building Anoma will also be participating in the Feigenbaum testnet to ensure that it runs smoothly. Furthermore, some will be available on Anoma’s [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RzN98vXbFt) (#feigenbaum channel) to help out with installation or any other issues, as well as for gathering user feedback.\\n\\nFinally, to stay up-to-date on all news and communications related to Anoma’s Feigenbaum and future testnets, we recommend that you fill in [this form](https://forms.gle/GLzTF37vwokbFYeW9) to receive the testnet newsletter.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1635972285,\"title\":\"Announcing Feigenbaum: Anoma’s First Public Testnet\"},\"digest\":\"gAjgTJhKSf0PuzvRaP5ohCw1E2_0zp0YnNh0mwVxh3E\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2ff74049304739bf5020D14258f24A47b54C407B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T2cqgWCb6sMiEnYPFOsr43zxJHa1TSDKiz1qs-xi-i4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q6PcayqkZIOF8-QfTBWg_gnm9APigxAesXjxs6p6P-A\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SdGG3yEwDetRQseRRFbYn6tJKHfIavCKmA9Cy7B7wH8Mr5w65MCSAiwPqOM5XfCL4PK_Zymsle_P4oJHDcex6w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x290d1d375823b7e6fb7c92503f6541159a86296f3477a6b720313b2a35a801c34f29f244df13758f7d77b3ceab83712a7f7c314cdd0e1cdbc0d2a7069dfdf4fe1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T2cqgWCb6sMiEnYPFOsr43zxJHa1TSDKiz1qs-xi-i4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q6PcayqkZIOF8-QfTBWg_gnm9APigxAesXjxs6p6P-A\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"gAjgTJhKSf0PuzvRaP5ohCw1E2_0zp0YnNh0mwVxh3E\"}"
