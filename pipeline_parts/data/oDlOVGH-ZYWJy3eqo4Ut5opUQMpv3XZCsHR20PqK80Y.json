"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Fonts are everywhere, we all use them sometimes underestimating their usefulness.\\n\\nTypefaces are capable of giving added value to a project by contributing in giving an emotional tone and functionality to the communication that is to be implemented.\\n\\nWe can imagine fonts like that pinch of salt in a plate of pasta, if it is not added everyone will notice the difference.\\n\\nJust think of the recent typographic redesign implemented by Twitter, within a few hours, everyone noticed that there was something different in the UI and then people judged if that different pinch of salt was a good choice or the ruin of the dish.\\n\\n[https://slate.com/technology/2021/08/twitter-font-redesign-chirp-franklin-gothic.html](https://slate.com/technology/2021/08/twitter-font-redesign-chirp-franklin-gothic.html)\\n\\nPersonally, I think the current font market is a disaster.\\n\\nA zombie market, with piracy raging and a single centralising entity of power that is GoogleFont. The service provided by Google is certainly useful and excellent for designers and developers, but I wonder if we are really sure that it is the fairest way to fight piracy and encourage indie type designers and digital foundries work.\\n\\nIf we analyse the web design market we will find boring homologation, most of the web pages converge on the usual 3/4 font families.\\n\\nProxima Nova, Montserrat, Poppins, Noto sansâ€¦\\n\\nI bet if you are a designer you will have used them at least once :)\\n\\nI would be very happy to reward those who dedicate time and study to the type design industry but I feel, the market has too many barriers to small professionals, and college designers who should spend a large chunk of the budget from commissioned project to buy licenses on typefaces.\\n\\nSurely work has to be paid, but it's fair to say that design and communication industries deserve an inclusive and accessible market.\\n\\nBeing a crypto-designer it is impossible not to see margins of innovation through emerging tools such as DAOs and non-fungible tokens.\\n\\n## Introducing 99Fonts DAO fundraising \\n\\n99Fonts DAO wants to create a community of designers and enthusiasts who can collaborate creating typefaces and experimenting new business models for creators and buyers.\\n\\nLike any self-respecting DAO, there is a need for membership and productivity, so the purpose of this article is to raise funds and distribute ownership through the minting of a genesis font that can set up this DAO firm. Genesis piece is a gothic font inspired by the typefaces used by Gutenberg for the first printing of the Bible.\\n\\n**By purchasing 99Fonts genesis NFT you will give birth to the discord server that will establish the DAO** **and you will earn access to all root font files (AI, PDF, OTF files) that will enable future derivatives implementations.**\\n\\n*I want to point out that it is my prerogative to create a truly decentralised system and the funds raised from the sale will be deposited into the DAO treasury fund.*\\n\\n[edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=265](edition://0xaf89C5E115Ab3437fC965224D317d09faa66ee3E?editionId=265)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1632167793,\"title\":\"Experimenting Type design with DAOs\",\"publication\":\"malandraj\"},\"digest\":\"g2VBuK4R5FunHrxQtXcerbC2pwjv4I1y9LuMorCsebM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x2f28D0f18d70CEcCF1FA969542Cc2597615b11CB\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ws_sOF3zhJBpDG1bHFBAfBaj4EccYSjRAmoaaHa_G1Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q715kZY5bI_szut1TMo98wju5koiYVKQOwF8WJmnb3U\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"LtFDQsWIrnshMLMoYgAKY4YbK-_roIDxkHTb1ACuzDsYGU_GI6Id3FqInmf7IAIp_5OKQX0rX6YB1RcpFK9X_w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x170db63d65848a643555b179d94288043b34ceade727bffd3c5fbe1b2d4cdf0a4c1e58a40ccbf7884baa643f2604fb371ac6ad3968ed36a121be271cc4c527c81c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on malandraj.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"ws_sOF3zhJBpDG1bHFBAfBaj4EccYSjRAmoaaHa_G1Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Q715kZY5bI_szut1TMo98wju5koiYVKQOwF8WJmnb3U\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"Fj_6fzQZdmJaLmDd_VkPWcpoS7Qh9Hwc8arvoqo9YQU\"}"
