"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1917 France**\\n\\nMargaretha Geertruida Zelle was born in the Netherlands, 1876, the eldest of 4. \\n\\n\\\"M'greet\\\", as she was called by her family, had a happy childhood. At age 13 it all went wrong.\\n\\nHer father's hat business went bust, and soon after her parents divorced. 2 years later, her mother died, and her godfather became her guardian. M'greet began training as a kindergarten teacher but her godfather took her away due to the headmaster's advances.\\n\\nAt 18, she answered an ad for a wife and married Dutch Colonial Captain Rudolf MacLeod. The marriage was a disaster. Rudolf was an abusive alcoholic, with a mistress. M'greet ran into the arms of another officer, and began to study the local culture of Java. She took an artist name for \\\"the sun\\\" - \\\"the Eye of The Day\\\", in Malay.\\n\\nShe became \\\"Lady MacLeod\\\", and worked as an artist's model and circus horse rider. By 1904 she joined the ranks of modern dance, and looked to Egypt and Asia, for her exotic dancing.\\n\\nA Dutch middle-class girl reinvented herself as a princess from Java, raised in the arts of sacred Indian dance. Her exotic dance was clothed with a backstory rooted in the Dutch East Indies. By 1915, it was over, due to imitators and time. It all went wrong again.\\n\\nA lover, a Russian pilot flying for the French, was shot down over Germany. She wanted to see him. The French agreed only if she would spy for them. She was a public figure who had relationships with powerful men among the elite. It ended badly.\\n\\nShe was an embarrassment to both sides and had to be eliminated. Her prosecutors included one of her recruiters. Her Russian lover had abandoned her. Mata Hari was executed in 1917. Her remains were not claimed, used for medical study, and are in the Museum of Anatomy in Paris. \\n\\nParts mysteriously remain lost.\\n\\n**2913 Earth - The Necklace, The Pearl**\\n\\nJacob C. Tagore, Jr. soaked in the energy of the afterparty in 'The Pearl', a gathering and event space, a node within the 'Verse of the System. He was attending as a dignitary of a Martian Trade Cooperative. As far as everyone was concerned he was another \\\"VIP\\\" pampered by the amenities of his hosts.\\n\\nThe Director sent Jacob to meet with Fernanda Marie-Therese Roque. Jacob's real assignment was to get close to the Praetor of the Triumvirate, Alea, one of the A.I.s who ruled over the System.\\n\\nShe was created was to prosecute the Long War. Instead, she banded with all surviving A.I.s to make peace, and take over.\\n\\n\\\"If you get close to Alea, what do you expect, prison or death?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I expect information.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I know better than to ask. All you want from me is access to her.”\\n\\n\\\"That's right, Lady Fernanda. How to reach her, nothing else.\\\"\\n\\nFernanda knew better than to ask 'why' or 'what for', that was not her game, winning moves meant staying alive and in business.\\n\\n\\\"Lady Fernanda\\\" was a long way away from her pre-war life running off-chain businesses on Mars. A long way from Gunnery Sergeant \\\"Furry\\\" Roque during the War. One thing stayed same.\\n\\n\\\"My beautiful brilliant star, my '1 of 1', has nothing to do with this. I promised her family, her mother, to keep Elena safe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have my word, that 'Lenamay' is not a part of this.”\\n\\nJacob thought about his Uncle AL and how AL tried to protect him after Jacob Sr.'s passing. Across the room, he saw 'Lenamay' wave at Fernanda. Fernanda waved back and rose from her chair.\\n\\n\\\"Good, I will help.\\\" Fernanda walked over to the other end of the room to embrace her protege. \\n\\nJacob sat back down, finished his drink, took in one last look of the room an Earth-view, and left.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1Sa1PiTzq4phYE3QnEVGI.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ruP9gP7bEKm1toh_F-xTw.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1633899512,\"title\":\"1961: 5.18 The Eye Of The Day, 2913\"},\"digest\":\"IL87mzwDOE8L0uOpouIhKkXMottP4a7UK3lVdi7Vdus\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Ro5X6egiVrITM_s8ihP0aHcdnoZi-_UW97Qzlflo9XUJn2wxAszd_poBi-VYzdW_8OkzCXjrlGLMJfdMMJY-Kw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc5f6a6de06c37a59b4940e8beaebe9f5078a93d485cef5bfcd1558d49fe7c6993bac33f1382180bc010311fc2826a27ec344a8b01732332273c07617223db15a1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_GQ6g4V5Cvk8Yikrfb8EfIlitQVlgaYce8s_L1vS2cY\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"YWlyk7ahmCd6PqsL6X6webu7CEOkHeiJEoqCK1Wvxa0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IL87mzwDOE8L0uOpouIhKkXMottP4a7UK3lVdi7Vdus\"}"
