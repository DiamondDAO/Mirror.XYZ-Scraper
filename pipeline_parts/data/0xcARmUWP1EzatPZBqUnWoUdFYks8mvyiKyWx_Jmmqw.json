She had not yet made her diagnosis public, per [AP](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-florida-b79b9e4308b9ce0b4335cdfa69436b1b).\\n\\n* Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo had asked to meet with Polsky as he prepares for his upcoming Senate confirmation hearing, per Florida Politics.\\n* Polsky told Ladapo that she had a serious condition, and Ladapo offered to talk outside, which Polsky rebuffed, saying she would prefer to chat in her office. After some back-and forth, Polsky asked Ladapo if there was a reason he couldn't wear a mask.\\n* “He just smiles and doesn’t answer. He’s very smug,” Polsky told Florida Politics. “And I told him several times, 'I have this very serious medical condition.’ And he said, ‘That’s OK,’ like it basically has nothing to do with what we are talking about.”\\n* She eventually asked Ladapo and two of his legislative aides to leave.\\n\\n**Florida State Senate President** Wilton Simpson denounced Ladapo's behavior in a memo to members and Senate staff Saturday night, per [Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/467261-senate-president-blasts-florida-surgeon-general-for-his-unprofessional-actions/).\\n\\n* “What occurred in Senator Polsky’s office was unprofessional and will not be tolerated in the Senate,\\\" Simpson wrote. “While there is no mask mandate in the Senate, Senators and staff can request social distancing and masking within their own offices.\\\"\\n* “It shouldn’t take a cancer diagnosis for people to respect each other’s level of comfort with social interactions during a pandemic,\\\" he noted.\\n\\n**Of note:** Florida Gov.
