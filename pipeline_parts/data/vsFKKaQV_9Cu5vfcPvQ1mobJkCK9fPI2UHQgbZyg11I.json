The model is a braneworld theory that involves a finite five-dimensional bulk that is extremely warped and contains two branes: the Planckbrane (where gravity is a relatively strong force; also called \\\"Gravitybrane\\\") and the Tevbrane (our home with the Standard Model particles; also called \\\"Weakbrane\\\"). The 2 branes are separated in the not-necessarily large 5th dimension by approximately 16 units (the units based on the brane and bulk energies). The Planckbrane has positive brane energy, and the Tevbrane has negative brane energy. These energies are the cause of the extremely warped spacetime. In this warped spacetime that is only warped along the fifth dimension, the graviton's probability function is extremely high at the Planckbrane, but it drops exponentially as it moves closer towards the Tevbrane. In this, gravity would be much weaker on the Tevbrane than on the Planckbrane.\\n\\nStruck with newfound clarity and motivated by aesthetic, personal reasons, I  developed upon this model to devise my own Hourglass model that can offer answers to a wider range of unanswered questions in science and beyond. Hourglass model similarly involves 2 branes with the following properties:\\n\\n1. M-Brane (or “my brane”, also “local brane,” Tevbrane or Weakbrane): expanding; 3-dimensional; density parameter (Ω)<1; negative brane energy; negative curvature of space; low concentration of graviton; hosting Standard Model particles;\\n2. G-Brane (or “gravity brane”, also “nonlocal brane, ”Planckbrane): contracting, density parameter (Ω)>1; positive brane energy; positive curvature of space; high concentration of graviton; hosting unknown open-string native particles;\\n\\nScientists could count the amount of ordinary matter (stars, intergalactic gas, etc.) in our universe and found out that the average density is much less than the critical density, so M-brane is supposed to be an open, expanding universe with negative curvature of space. However, it turned out that the WMAP and Planck spacecrafts did measure the universe’s curvature to be nearly flat. On the other hand, if graviton is so densely concentrated in G-brane, its geometry should be different from that of M-brane, which should be a closed, contracting universe with positive curvature of space. My hypothesis is that the curvature of the two branes must have cancelled out each other and made our universe “look” flat. The appearance of this “curvature cancellation” is dark matter and dark energy, which are forms of energy oozing out from G-brane into M-brane.\\n\\nHourglass model is named for the cyclic nature at the core of my hypotheses: the ever-increasing formation of dimension-tearing black holes will accelerate “energy oozing” and lead to an eventual collapse of the whole universe into a “dimensional soup,” which is so unstable that it will immediately restructure back into the two-brane setup, with excessive entropy escaping into a “trash brane.” When the contracting G-brane and expanding M-brane burst into two new branes, from a conceptual point of view it would look like they have just swapped places, hence the Hourglass.\\n\\nNow to unify science and spirituality once and for all, this is my ultimate hypothesis: Under gravitationally attractive force, any massive object in M-brane should attract a correspondingly massive object in G-brane. This is analogous to a piece of magnet on one side of a sheet of paper attracting a lump of metal dust on the other side. As a massive object, each human has an attachment in G-brane, which is a cluster of particles constituted of unknown open-string particles exclusive to G-brane. Let’s playfully call this attachment a “g-pet” because you drag it along wherever you go. Spiritually speaking, this g-pet is your “soul.” All metaphysical phenomena ever correctly recorded should have arisen from nonlocal interactions among g-pets. Under rare conditions, g-pets can theoretically behave like nonlocal supercomputers that not only compute but also exert force in M-brane.\\n\\nDue to G-brane’s higher density, particle/energy/information flow from M-brane to G-brane is more favorable than the other way around. After a human deceases and the body disintegrates, its g-pet might shrink to an arbitrary degree and “drift” freely in G-brane without taking a form in M-brane. The only structure in the human brain that can transduce infinitesimal gravitational energy from G-brane into neuronal signals (human-perceptible information) are the piezoelectric microcrystals in the pineal gland. These are hints to unify science and spirituality. The final goal would be to tap into the unlimited source of energy and computing power in G-brane by constructing apparatus that can time nonlocal interference and mimick g-pet-like abilities.\\n\\nIn summary, Hourglass model seeks to offer answers to some unanswered questions in science and beyond including: dark matter; dark energy; why gravity is too weak; flat curvature of space; how to unite science and spirituality.\",\"timestamp\":1642094739,\"title\":\"The Hourglass model\"},\"digest\":\"HTVjwtqCDGo_bxn-Yfp3ioDvC8PKEejYmqbgFVdP9C4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x20907Ffa9c4970F5720B95A1f88174732684441A\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"H4WKf7La-Lf8AjdCsl09k0qT_DtkkOx_T9UHPe0cN6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2sxeYTFqKHSUtWANw87eJHgpP9EOq1ulN2OOL6ODmvY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"-sicyvv3OE8e8KzIzfFh36lrxeDj8FKzw_uGwvJzN5hmpKXqoLRBiqespoHh_7OPsb_8gfTYL38JJir8u0dHcw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x093c05c0885465f76ebbeba9b786aee644655b1a0ef04499fd972438632e86be1b5fb84632596d8095f703430b7952889818b7975990395f2168e785d7fff63d1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"H4WKf7La-Lf8AjdCsl09k0qT_DtkkOx_T9UHPe0cN6A\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"2sxeYTFqKHSUtWANw87eJHgpP9EOq1ulN2OOL6ODmvY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"wARIfGO8hOlSspZtJiukgeK83ySlsuPrmiRx3b-AFds\"}"
