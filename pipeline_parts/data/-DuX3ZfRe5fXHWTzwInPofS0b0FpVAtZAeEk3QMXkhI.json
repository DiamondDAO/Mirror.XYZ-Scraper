"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Generous design is unknown.\\n\\nIt does not need authority, No need to climb to the top of a tower.\\n\\nThere are too many towers to climb, and by the time you got to the top of one, there is a taller one built right next to it. Generous design understands that in a world of AI, cause and effect thinking is not enough.\\n\\nFully wrapping our arms around a system is a luxury we no longer have. The interconnectedness of our lives makes order impossible. So rather than writing up maps, we should carry a compass. So much of our lives is about navigating the unknown.\\n\\nUnknowing is a human state.\\n\\nGenerous design accepts the liminal, Open-ended universe.\\n\\nIt is strength through vulnerability. It is strength through adaptability.\\n\\nAll Rigidness crushes under the weight of change.\\n\\nGenerous design is not a beautifully designed object put on a pedestal. It is the shining of different lights on that object.\\n\\nGenerous design is not the war of words but the dance of opinions.\\n\\nBeing territorial about knowledge is as futile as trying to catch air. Generous design is for the unknown. It is about walking in the dark instead of waiting for someone to turn on the light. It is about moving from the meta meaning to the lived experience and back. It is about being able to self-reflect and practice intentional thinking.\\n\\n![](https://blotcdn.com/blog_cdccbc7413a447938cac499563767cf0/_image_cache/ee0428f3-8c67-4771-8820-bdfb91f1d353.png)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636028145,\"title\":\"The 10 Rules of Generous Design - In Process\"},\"digest\":\"x06Ryo_gcJYUG9k1QvdVbBHIhy6mHuVICVmqtHoKdaQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xE407380453a85C942BC8d3AbD55B8060971a1798\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"N0iJSxvy4Io6XuluhyHkY8VLHvN1qVfsGxTKmwalqTA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zes3Zhsb98W1Ew_xxBb2vcb-IvWX1hc6_xEvrdZAHsQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"TfMTf_QgM4Djd_DWYWvJkm2_VOs_Bf0iGtUSFj_wbjFhINQp8DNpJt_vDssFItpVTy0Z9OiSOgKhwvus3iZOTQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9e603eeda1f8d22b773c271bd7a2135c912dd974d3622862b13c4e0ec2716f8a6c2135267f823c38a065dad6831bf7bca9563d3faf5481931bd7c325c40d77f71c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"N0iJSxvy4Io6XuluhyHkY8VLHvN1qVfsGxTKmwalqTA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zes3Zhsb98W1Ew_xxBb2vcb-IvWX1hc6_xEvrdZAHsQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"x06Ryo_gcJYUG9k1QvdVbBHIhy6mHuVICVmqtHoKdaQ\"}"
