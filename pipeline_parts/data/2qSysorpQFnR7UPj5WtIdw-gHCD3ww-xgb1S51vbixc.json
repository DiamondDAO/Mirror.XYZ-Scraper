"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**TLDR**\\n\\n1. Pain while pooping is never normal. There is almost always a medical cause. You should see a doctor.\\n2. Anal fissures are the most common cause of pain while pooping amongst working age adults\\n3. Anal fissures are a two part problem - initial damage to the anal skin, and muscle spasm causing reduced blood flow and preventing healing of the original damage\\n4. To treat fissures, you need to prevent further damage to the anal skin by regulating your bowels. Your doctor can help treat the muscle spasm by creams, botox injections or surgery to heal the damage. Once the damage is healed, your pain will go away.\\n\\n**Why does it hurt when I poop, and what should I do?**\\n\\nPain with pooping is never normal. Almost always it suggests that there is damaged skin somewhere near your anus. It is tricky to figure out what has caused the damage, and you will almost always want a professional to examine your bottom and figure out what is going on.\\n\\nThe 3 main causes your doctor will want to differentiate between are:\\n\\n* Anal Fissures\\n* Thrombosed haemorrhoids\\n* Anal Cancer\\n\\n**How do I know if I have an anal fissure?**\\n\\n\\nIt can be tricky to self diagnose, as it is hard to see the area. The usual symptoms are bright red blood on wiping, and a razor blade type pain when you use your bowels. Because there is an overlap in symptoms with haemorrhoids, there is often confusion between the two.\\n\\nHere is an image [(source)](https://emottawablog.com/2019/10/the-bottom-line-hemorrhoids-and-anal-fissures-in-the-ed/)\\n\\n![This patient has two fissures. One is visible (top), the other (bottom) suggested by the lump called a 'sentinel tag'. ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ADx9xcjQ2V4BjpV9upnIe.png?height=579&width=604)\\n\\nAs you can see, it’s pretty subtle, and if you don’t know what you’re looking for, you’re likely to call it the wrong thing. To make the diagnosis for certain, you should see your doctor. In general the younger you are (teens and 20’s), the more likely you are to have a fissure not haemorrhoids as a cause of pain and bleeding from the butt.\\n\\n**What causes anal fissures?**\\n\\nThere are 2 important parts to an anal fissure - the initial injury, and the muscle spasm that prevents healing.\\n\\nIn short, fissures are breaks in the lining of the anal canal caused by trauma of some kind. Typically this is a constipated hard stool, but could also be explosive diarrhoea, anal sex or surgery to the anal canal like having haemorrhoids removed.\\n\\nThe butt is a sensitive area, so a small injury like a fissure can cause a lot of pain. One of the body’s natural reflex responses to pain is muscle spasm. For example, if you injure your back, the body responds with muscle spasm to keep the tissues stiff and still, and let it heal. In anal fissures, it’s the internal anal sphincter that spasms.\\n\\nThe butt is a sensitive area, so a small injury like a fissure causes a lot of pain. As a result the spasm is often intense.\\n\\n*Spasm is the reason fissures don’t heal, because blood flow to the area becomes reduced. This perpetuates the pain-spasm cycle.*\\n\\nDoctors have learnt (by trial and error) that relieving spasm is the best way to heal fissures. It is important to remember that the spasm is a reflex and not under your conscious control. Whilst many fissures do heal by themselves in the early stages, once the pain-spasm cycle is firmly established, anti spasm treatment is required to heal the fissure. Fissures lasting beyond six weeks are less likely to heal without treatment.\\n\\n**How are fissures treated?**\\nAll of the effective fissure treatments work by relieving spasm. The only difference between them is how long the anti spasm effect lasts for.\\n\\nAs a starting point, regulating bowel function into the Goldilocks zone of passing a single, formed, play dough consistency stool is best. For most Westerners this means taking a fibre supplement of some kind like psyllium.\\n\\n## Treatments:\\n\\nThe commonest treatments for fissures are creams, Botox and surgery.\\n\\n**How do creams work?** These creams contain medications that relax the anal sphincter muscle, restoring blood flow and allowing the fissure to heal. Typically these creams last six or eight hours and when used regularly will heal ⅔ of fissures in six weeks. The downside is the side effects.\\n\\n**Rectogesic** contains GTN (Glyceryl Trinitrate), a medication traditionally used for angina (heart pain) and hypertension (high blood pressure). It works by relaxing the involuntary continence muscle (the internal anal sphincter). Unfortunately, because it is absorbed into the body, it can cause a throbbing headache as well as dizziness when standing up (postural hypotension) as side effects.\\n\\n**Diltiazem and nifedipine** are re-purposed blood pressure medications and also work by reducing spasm, but by a different mechanism. They don’t cause headache, so are likely more effective because they are more likely to be consistently used. The downside is that these medications are harder to source and obtain. In Australia, you need to get a compounding pharmacy to make it up - meaning this is more expensive, and less standardised. This means there can be differences from batch to batch, and different pharmacies might use different additives which may affect the effectiveness of the medication.\\n\\n**Botox injections** (yes the same that are used for wrinkle treatment) are used because the botulinum toxin causes muscle paralysis and again reduces spasm. A small dose of botox is injected into the internal anal sphincter. Only a little bit of the sphincter has to relax, to improve the blood flow enough to heal the fissure. The advantage is that the effect lasts for up to 12 weeks. The downside is the injections are expensive, and at the moment must be administered by needle, often requiring hospital admission with anaesthetic, which further increases the wait times and cost of treatment. Effectiveness for one injection is said to be around 75%.\\n\\n**Surgery** has the advantage of being 99% effective, but requires an anaesthetic, and the effect is permanent. The procedure is usually called a ‘lateral internal sphincterotomy’ and this involves cutting part of the continence muscle (usually about 5mm worth). The side effect is a theoretical increase in incontinence especially with age. In practice, because of the differing anatomy in males and females, it is used as a good option for resistant fissures in males. Males usually have a 30-35mm continence muscle, so cutting 5mm rarely causes long term problems. In females however, the muscle is shorter (25mm) and the effect of childbirth and menopause can reduce continence. It is therefore offered sparingly in females, because the rate of continence problems is so high anyway.\\n\\n**\\\\*\\\\*The promotional bit.**\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*At [downthere.healthcare](https://downthere.healthcare/?v=6cc98ba2045f) we have a mission. We want to educate people as best we can about the common conditions affecting the penises, vaginas and butts, to the best of our ability. Science based, but also admitting where the science doesn’t exist.\\n\\nWe want to liberate the people with conditions that have previously been swept under the rug. They are common! We are all born with butts, penises and vaginas, or combinations of and use them in different ways, any they are subject to conditions and illnesses just like anywhere else in the body. You shouldn’t feel embarrassed to talk about it. If you want to do your bit to help us de-stigmatise these conditions, share our brand on your socials.\\n\\nWe also want to listen. In medicine there is a concept called ‘Level IV’ evidence, which says that in the absence of a rigorous scientific experiments, the next best thing is expert opinion. We disagree! Listening to lots of other peoples’ experiences is often more useful than listening to the opinion of a single expert, and we’d like to listen to, and share your experiences, opinions and complaints to make a difference.\\n\\nWith that in mind, for anal fissure, we are working on a few projects under the name “\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Fiss Off”, and if you like what you see, we’d love it if you could show your support.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Fiss Off Cream is going to be a cream containing:\\n\\n* Diltiazem, which based on the limited existing scientific literature, has the lowest risk of side effects compared to the alternatives GTN and nifedipine, but equal effectiveness.\\n* Amethocaine - a smooth muscle relaxing local anaesthetic that both helps with the pain of fissures, but also (we think) will cause further sphincter relaxation, and improve healing.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*Fiss Off Injectors will be a needleless botox injector using the principle of jet injection that will allow the botox treatment of anal fissures without needles or anaesthesia.\\n\\nIf you want to be updated on the progress of these projects, subscribe to updates on our website.\\n\\nWe welcome your feedback/support at contact \\\\[at\\\\] downthere.healthcare\",\"timestamp\":1641192254,\"title\":\"What could anal fissures have to do with painful pooping?\"},\"digest\":\"CVe4OCPzvJqlEZzOhNJH4E4Tmxl5sIeBgvJAjMLorXw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4711E751fc05db16Cdb97fb679c1FB7253df8ae5\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"efxR6qJHO5aqH7Dj0uQRGNqtYKVxUvDRTLhtwbEhv7M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1fh54EmI9LtcxxXds3NMe7ycroe4tWSCSdsm_HNjkLE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Jg9uZpuh86W9pADaAp-T800AfCltsqj-7tURaYsWgzDNVjwOU_Brf1yUWpnV7VeuSgQrrV1-c6iXilLIXeW2kA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xaa3b7aa48ec30444da5087292ff996b49f4c195f22ebedbbdfc322e421d976a768216745f3fe2ca1115a6cbb716c843631a3cbb4aaa6c5173765a0f77bcf86d21b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"efxR6qJHO5aqH7Dj0uQRGNqtYKVxUvDRTLhtwbEhv7M\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1fh54EmI9LtcxxXds3NMe7ycroe4tWSCSdsm_HNjkLE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"vo3GX_x2rbLrgB-qZLOSzan8YO0UdDn5RROcRL4QSC8\"}"
