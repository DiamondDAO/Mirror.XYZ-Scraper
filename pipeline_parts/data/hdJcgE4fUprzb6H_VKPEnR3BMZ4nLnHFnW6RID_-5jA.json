"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"for she was seventy years old, nevertheless she recognized me as I stepped out of the train, and began to talk to me in her usual interminable fashion so soon as we were seated in the hired coupe, which my aunt had sent to meet me whenever I came to Compiegne, from the days of my earliest childhood.  How well I knew the heavy old vehicle, with its worn cushions of yellow leather, and the driver, who had been in the service of the livery stable keeper as long as I could remember.  He was a little man with a merry, roguish face, and eyes twinkling with fun; but he tried to give a melancholy tone to his salutation that morning. \\\"It took her yesterday,\\\" said Julie, while the vehicle rumbled heavily through the streets, \\\"but you see it had to happen.  Our poor demoiselle had been changing for weeks past.  She was so trustful, so gentle, so just; she scolded, she ferreted about, she suspected--there, then, her head was all astray.  She talked of nothing but thieves and assassins; she thought everybody wanted to do her some harm, the tradespeople, Jean Mariette, myself--yes, I too.  She went into the cellar every day to count the bottles of wine, and wrote the number down on a paper.  The next day she found the same number, and she would maintain the paper was not the same, she disowned her own handwriting.  I wanted to tell you this the last time you came here, but I did not venture to say anything; I was afraid it would worry you, and then I thought these were only freaks, that she was a little crazy, and it would pass off.  Well, then, I came down yesterday to keep her company at her dinner, as she always liked me to do, because, you know, she was fond of me in reality, whether she was ill or well.  I could not find her. Mariette, Jean, and I searched everywhere, and at last Jean bethought him of letting the dog loose; the animal brought us straight to the wood-stock, and there we found her lying at full length upon the ground.  No doubt she had gone to the stack to count the logs.  We lifted her up, our poor dear demoiselle!  Her mouth was crooked, and one side of her could not move.  She began to talk.  Then we thought she was mad, for she said senseless words which we could not understand; but the doctor assures us that she is perfectly clear in her head, only that she utters one word when she means another.  She gets angry if we do not obey her on the instant.  Last night when I was sitting up with her she asked for some pins.  I brought them and she was angry.  Would you believe that it was the time of night she wanted to know?  At length, by dint of questioning her, and by her yesses and noes, which she expresses with her sound hand, I have come to make out her meaning. If you only knew how troubled she was all night about you; I saw it, and when I uttered your name her eyes brightened.  She repeats words, you would think she raves: she calls for you.  Now look here, M. Andre, it was the ideas she had about your poor father that brought on her illness.  All these last weeks she talked of nothing else.  She would say: 'If only they do not kill Andre also. As for me, I am old, but he so young, so good, so gentle.'  And she cried--yes, she cried incessantly.  'Who is it that you think wants to harm M. Andre?' I asked her.  Then she turned away from me with a look of distrust that cut me to the heart, although I knew that her head was astray.  The doctor says that she believes herself persecuted, and that it is a mania; he also says that she may recover, but will never have her speech again.\\\" I listened to Julie's talk in silence; I made no answer.  I was not surprised that my Aunt Louise had begun to be attacked by a mental malady; the trials of her life sufficiently explained this, and I could also account for several singularities that I had observed in her attitude towards me of late.  She had surprised me much by asking me to bring back a book of my father's which I had never thought of taking away.  \\\"Return it to me,\\\" she said, insisting upon it so strongly, that I instituted a search for the book, and at last unearthed it from the bottom of a cupboard where it had been placed, as if on purpose, under a heap of other books. Julie's prolix narrative only enlightened me as to the sad cause of what I had taken for the oddity of a fidgety and lonely old maid. On the other hand, I could not take the ideas of my father's death so philosophically as Julie accepted them.  What were those ideas? Many a time, in the course of conversation with her, I had vaguely felt that she was not opening her heart quite freely to me.  Her determined opposition to my plans of a personal inquiry might proceed from her piety, which would naturally cause her to disapprove of any thought or project of vengeance, but was there nothing else, nothing besides that piety in question?  Her strange solicitude for my personal safety, which even led her to entreat me not to go out unarmed in the evening, or get into an empty compartment in a train, with other counsels of the same kind, was no doubt caused by morbid excitement; still her constant and distressing dread might possibly rest upon a less vague foundation than I imagined. I also recalled, with a certain apprehension, that so soon as she ceased to be able completely to control her mind these strange fears took stronger possession of her than before.  \\\"What!\\\" said I to myself, \\\"am I becoming like her, that I let such things occur to me?  Are not these fixed ideas quite natural in a person whose brain is racked by the mania of persecution, and who has lost a beloved brother under circumstances equally mysterious and tragical?\\\" \\\"She is awake,\\\" said Julie, who had taken the maid's place at the foot of the bed.  I approached my aunt and called her by her name. I then clearly saw her poor face distorted by paralysis. She recognized me, and as I bent down to kiss her, she stroked my cheek with her sound hand.  This caress, which was habitual with her, she repeated slowly several times.  I placed her, with Julie's assistance, on her back, so that she could see me distinctly; she looked at me for a long time, and two heavy tears fell from the eyes in which I read boundless tenderness, supreme anguish, and inexpressible pity.  I answered them by my own tears, which she dried with the back of her hand; then she strove to speak to me, but could only pronounce an incoherent sentence that struck me to the heart.  She saw, by the expression of my face, that I had not understood her, and she made a desperate effort to find words in which to render the thought evidently precise and lucid in her mind.  Once more she uttered an unintelligible phrase, and began again to make the feeble gesture of despairing helplessness which had so shocked me at her waking.  She appeared, however, to take courage when I put the question to her: \\\"What do you want of me, dear aunt?\\\"  She made a sign that Julie was to leave the room, and no sooner were we alone than her face changed.  With my help she was able to slip her hand under her pillow, and withdraw her bunch of keys; then separating one key from the others she imitated the opening of a lock.  I immediately remembered her groundless fears of being robbed and I asked her whether she wanted the box to which that key belonged.  It was a small key of a kind that is specially made for safety locks.  I saw that I had guessed aright; she was able to get out the word \\\"yes,\\\" and her eyes brightened. \\\"But where is this box?\\\" I asked.  Once more she replied by a sentence of which I could make nothing; and, seeing that she was relapsing into a state of agitation, with the former heart-rending movement, I begged her to allow me to question her and to answer by gestures only.  After some minutes, I succeeded in discovering that the box in question was locked up in one of the two large cupboards below stairs, and that the key of the cupboard was on the ring with the others.  I went downstairs, leaving her alone, as she had desired me by signs to do.  I had no difficulty in finding the casket to which the little key adapted itself; although it was carefully placed behind a bonnet-box and a case of silver forks. The casket was of sweet-scented wood, and the initials J. C. were inlaid upon the lid in gold and platinum.  J. C., Justin Cornelies-- so, it had belonged to my father.  I tried the key in the lock, to make quite sure that I was not mistaken. I then raised the lid, and glanced at the contents almost mechanically, supposing that I was about to find a roll of business papers, probably shares, a few trinket-cases, and rouleaux of napoleons, a small treasure in fact, hidden away from motives of fear.  Instead of this, I beheld several small packets carefully wrapped in paper, each being endorsed with the words, \\\"Justin's Letters,\\\" and the year in which they were written.  My aunt had preserved these letters with the same pious care that had kept her from allowing anything whatever belonging to him in whom the deepest affection of her life had centered, to be lost, parted with, or injured. But why had she never spoken to me of this treasure, which was more precious to me than to anyone else in the world?  I asked myself that question as I closed the box; then I reflected that no doubt she desired to retain the letters to the last hour of her life; and, satisfied with this explanation, I went upstairs again. From the doorway my eyes met hers, and I could not mistake their look of impatience and intense anxiety.  I placed the little coffer on her bed and she instantly opened it, took out a packet of letters, then another, finally kept only one out, replaced those she had removed at first, locked the box, and signed to me to place it on the chest of drawers.  While I was clearing away the things on the top of the drawers, to make a clear space for the box, I caught sight, in the glass opposite to me, of the sick woman.  By a great effort she had turned herself partly on her side, and she was trying to throw the packet of letters which she had retained into the fireplace; it was on the right of her bed, and only about a yard away from the foot.  But she could hardly raise herself at all, the movement of her hand was too weak, and the little parcel fell on the floor.  I hastened to her, to replace her head on the pillows and her body in the middle of the bed, and then, with her powerless arm she again began to make that terrible gesture of despair, clutching the sheet with her thin fingers, while tears streamed from her poor eyes. Ah! how bitterly ashamed I am of what I am going to write in this place!  I will write it, however, for I have sworn to myself that I will be true, even to the avowal of that fault, even to the avowal of a worse still.  I had no difficulty in understanding what was passing in my aunt's mind; the little packet--it had fallen on the carpet close to the fender--evidently contained letters which she wished to destroy, so that I should not read them.  She might have burned them, dreading as she did their fatal influence upon me, long since; yet I understood why she had shrunk from doing this, year after year, I, who knew with what idolatry she worshipped the smallest objects that had belonged to my father.  Had I not seen her put away the blotting-book which he used when he came to Compiegne, with the paper and envelopes that were in it at his last visit? Yes, she had gone on waiting, still waiting, before she could bring herself to part forever with those dear and dangerous letters, and then her sudden illness came, and with it the terrible thought that these papers would come into my possession.  I could also take into account that the unreasonable distrust which she had yielded to of late had prevented her from asking Jean or Julie for the little coffer.  This was the secret--I understood it on the instant--of the poor thing's impatience for my arrival, the secret also of the trouble I had witnessed.  And now her strength had betrayed her. She had vainly endeavored to throw the letters into the fire, that fire which she could hear crackling, without being able to raise her head so as to see the flame.  All these notions which presented themselves suddenly to my thoughts took form afterwards; at the moment they melted into pity for the suffering of the helpless creature before me. \\\"Do not disturb yourself, dear aunt,\\\" said I, as I drew the coverlet up to her shoulders, \\\"I am going to burn those letters.\\\" She raised her eyes, full of eager supplication.  I closed the lids with my lips and stooped to pick up the little packet.  On the paper in which it was folded, I distinctly read this date: \\\"1864-- Justin's letters.\\\"  1864! that was the last year of my father's life.  I know it, I feel it, that which I did was infamous; the last wishes of the dying are sacred.  I ought not, no, I ought not to have deceived her who was on the point of leaving me forever.  I heard her breathing quicken at that very moment.  Then came a whirlwind of thought too strong for me.  If my Aunt Louise was so wildly, passionately eager that those letters should be burned, it was because they could put me on the right track of vengeance. Letters written in the last year of my father's life, and she had never spoken of them to me!  I did not reason, I did not hesitate, in a lightning-flash I perceived the possibility of learning--what? I know not; but--of learning.  Instead of throwing the packet of letters into the fire, I flung it to one side, under a chair, returned to the bedside and told her in a voice which I endeavored to keep steady and calm, that her directions had been obeyed, that the letters were burning.  She took my hand and kissed it.  Oh, what a stab that gentle caress inflicted upon me!  I knelt down by her bedside, and hid my head in the sheets, so that her eyes should not meet mine.  Alas! it was not for long that I had to dread her glance.  At ten she fell asleep, but at noon her restlessness recurred.  At two the priest came, and administered the last sacraments to her.  She had a second stroke towards evening, never recovered consciousness, and died in the night.\\n\\nVI\\n\\nAt three o'clock in the morning Julie came in to take my place, and I retired to my room, which was on the same floor as my aunt's.  A boxroom divided the two.  I threw myself on my bed, worn out with fatigue, and nature triumphed over my grief.  I fell into that heavy sleep which follows the expenditure of nerve power, and from which one awakes able to bear life again and to carry the load that seemed unendurable.  When I awoke it was day, and the wintry sky was dull and dark like that of yesterday, but it also wore a threatening aspect, from the great masses of black cloud that covered it.  I went to the window and looked out for a long time at the gloomy landscape closed in by the edge of the forest.  I note these small details in order that I may more faithfully recall my exact impression at the time.  In turning away from the window and going towards the fire which the maid had just lighted, my eye fell upon the packet of letters stolen from my aunt.  Yes, stolen--'tis the word.  It was in the place where I had put it last night, on the mantel-shelf, with my purse, rings, and cigar-case.  I took up the little parcel with a beating heart.  I had only to stretch out my hand and those papers would fall into the flames and my aunt's dying wish be accomplished.  I sank into an easy-chair and watched the yellow flame gaining on the logs, while I weighed the packet in my hand.  I thought there must be a good many letters in it.  I suffered from the physical uneasiness of indecision.  I am not trying to justify this second failure of my loyalty to my dear aunt, I am trying to understand it. Those letters were not mine, I never ought to have appropriated them.  I ought now to destroy them unopened; all the more that the excitement of the first moment, the sudden rush of ideas which had prevented me from obeying the agonized supplication of my poor aunt, had subsided.  I asked myself once more what was the cause of her misery, while I gazed at the inscription upon the cover, in my aunt's hand: \\\"Justin's Letters, 1864.\\\"  The very room which I occupied was an evil counsellor to me in this strife between an indisputable duty and my ardent desire to know; for it had formerly been my father's room, and the furniture had not been changed since his time.  The color of the hangings was faded, that was all.  He had warmed himself by a fire which burned upon that self-same hearth, and he had used the same low, wide chair in which I now sat, thinking many somber thoughts.  He had slept in the bed from which I had just risen, he had written at the table on which I rested my arms.  No, that room deprived me of free will to act, it made my father too living.  It was as though the phantom of the murdered man had come out of his grave to entreat me to keep the oft-sworn vow of vengeance.  Had these letters offered me no more than one single chance, one against a thousand, of obtaining one single indication of the secrets of my father's private life, I could not have hesitated.  With such sacrilegious reasoning as this did I dispel the last scruples of pious respect; but I had no need of arguments for yielding to the desire which increased with every moment. I had there before me those letters, the last his hand had traced; those letters which would lay bare to me the recesses of his life, and I was not to read them!  What an absurdity!  Enough of such childish hesitation.  I tore off the cover which hid the papers; the yellow sheets with their faded characters shook in my hands.  I recognized the compact, square, clear writing, with spaces between the words.  The dates had been omitted by my father in several instances, and then my aunt had repaired the omission by writing in the day of the month herself.  My poor aunt! this pious carefulness was a fresh testimony to her constant tenderness; and yet, in my wild excitement I no longer thought of her who lay dead within a few yards of me. Presently Julie came to consult me upon all the material details which accompany death; but I told her I was too much overwhelmed, that she must do as she thought fit, and leave me quite alone for the whole of the morning.  Then I plunged so deeply into the reading of the letters, that I forgot the hour, the events taking place around me, forgot to dress myself, to eat, even to go and look upon her whom I had lost while yet I could behold her face. Traitor and ingrate that I was!  I had devoured only a few lines before I understood only too well why she had been desirous to prevent me from drinking the poison which entered with each sentence into my heart, as it had entered into hers.  Terrible, terrible letters!  Now it was as though the phantom had spoken, and a hidden drama of which I had never dreamed unfolded itself before me. I was quite a child when the thousand little scenes which this correspondence recorded in detail took place.  I was too young then to solve the enigma of the situation; and, since, the only person who could have initiated me into that dark history was she who had concealed the existence of the too-eloquent papers from me all her life long, and on her deathbed had been more anxious for their destruction than for her eternal salvation--she, who had no doubt accused herself of having deferred the burning of them from day to day as of a crime.  When at last she had brought herself to do this, it was too late. The first letter, written in January, 1864, began with thanks to my aunt for her New Year's gift to me--a fortress with tin soldiers-- with which I was delighted, said the letter, because the cavalry were in two pieces, the man detaching himself from his horse. Then, suddenly, the commonplace sentences changed into utterances of mournful tenderness.  An anxious mind, a heart longing for affection, and discontent with the existing state of things, might be discerned in the tone of regret with which the brother dwelt upon his childhood, and the days when his own and his sister's life were passed together.  There was a repressed repining in that first letter that immediately astonished and impressed me, for I had always believed my father and mother to have been perfectly happy with each other.  Alas! that repining did but grow and also take definite form as I read on.  My father wrote to his sister every Sunday, even when he had seen her in the course of the week.  As it frequently happens in cases of regular and constant correspondence, the smallest events were recorded in minute detail, so that all our former daily life was resuscitated in my thoughts as I perused the lines, but accompanied by a commentary of melancholy which revealed irreparable division between those whom I had believed to be so closely united.  Again I saw my father in his dressing-gown, as he greeted me in the morning at seven o'clock, on coming out of his room to breakfast with me before I started for school at eight.  He would go over my lessons with me briefly, and then we would seat ourselves at the table (without a tablecloth) in the dining-room, and Julie would bring us two cups of chocolate, deliciously sweetened to my childish taste.  My mother rose much later, and, after my school days, my father occupied a separate room in order to avoid waking her so early.  How I enjoyed that morning meal, during which I prattled at my ease, talking of my lessons, my exercises, and my schoolmates!  What a delightful recollection I retained of those happy, careless, cordial hours!  In his letters my father also spoke of our early breakfasts, but in a way that showed how often he was wounded by finding out from my talk that my mother took too little care of me, according to his notions--that I filled too small a place in her dreamy, wilfully frivolous life. There were passages which the then future had since turned into prophecies.  \\\"Were I to be taken from him, what would become of him?\\\" was one of these.  At ten I came back from school; by that time my father would be occupied with his business.  I had lessons to prepare, and I did not see him again until half-past eleven, at the second breakfast.  Then mamma would appear in one of those tasteful morning costumes which suited her slender and supple figure so well.  From afar, and beyond the cold years of my boyhood, that family table came before me like a mirage of warm homelife; how often had it become a sort of nostalgia to me when I sat between my mother and M. Termonde on my horrid half-holidays. And now I found proof in my father's letters that a divorce of the heart already existed between the two persons who, to my filial tenderness, were but one.  My father loved his wife passionately, and he felt that his wife did not love him.  This was the feeling continually expressed in his letters--not in words so plain and positive, indeed; but how should I, whose boyhood had been strangely analogous with this drama of a man's life, have failed to perceive the secret signification of all he wrote?  My father was taciturn, like me--even more so than I--and he allowed irreparable misunderstandings to grow up between my mother and himself.  Like me afterwards, he was passionate, awkward, hopelessly timid in the presence of that proud, aristocratic woman, so different from him, the self-made man of almost peasant origin, who had risen to professional prosperity by the force of his genius.  Like me--ah! not more than I--he had known the torture of false positions, which cannot be explained except by words that one will never have courage to utter.  And, oh, the pity of it, that destiny should thus repeat itself; the same tendencies of the mind developing themselves in the son after they had developed themselves in the father, so that the misery of both should be identical! My father's letters breathed sighs that my mother had never suspected--vain sighs for a complete blending of their two hearts; tender sighs for the fond dream of fully-shared happiness; despairing sighs for the ending of a moral separation, all the more complete because its origin was not to be sought in their respective faults (mutual love pardons everything), but in a complete, almost animal, contrast between the two natures.  Not one of his qualities was pleasing to her; all his defects were displeasing to her.  And he adored her.  I had seen enough of many kinds of ill-assorted unions since I had been going about in society, to understand in full what a silent hell that one must have been, and the two figures rose up before me in perfect distinctness.  I saw my mother with her gestures--a little affectation was, so to speak, natural to her--the delicacy of her hands, her fair, pale complexion, the graceful turn of her head, her studiously low-pitched voice, the something un-material that pervaded her whole person, her eyes, whose glance could be so cold, so disdainful; and, on the other hand, I saw my father with his robust, workingman's frame, his hearty laugh when he allowed himself to be merry, the professional, utilitarian, in fact, plebeian, aspect of him, in his ideas and ways, his gestures and his discourse.  But the plebeian was so noble, so lofty in his generosity, in his deep feeling.  He did not know how to show that feeling; therein lay his crime.  On what wretched trifles, when we think of it, does absolute felicity or irremediable misfortune depend! The name of M. Termonde occurred several times in the earlier letters, and, when I came to the eleventh, I found it mentioned in a way which brought tears to my eyes, set my hands shaking, and made my heart leap as at the sound of a cry of sharp agony.  In the pages which he had written during the night--the writing showed how deeply he was moved--the husband, hitherto so self-restrained, acknowledged to his sister, his kind and faithful confidante, that he was jealous.  He was jealous, and of whom?  Of that very man who was destined to fill his place at our fireside, to give a new name to her who had been Madame Cornelis; of the man with cat-like ways, with pale eyes, whom my childish instinct had taught me to regard with so precocious and so fixed a hate.  He was jealous of Jacques Termonde.  In his sudden confession he related the growth of this jealousy, with the bitterness of tone that relieves the heart of misery too long suppressed.  In that letter, the first of a series which death only was destined to interrupt, he told how far back was the date of his jealousy, and how it awoke to life with his detection of one look cast at my mother by Termonde.  He told how he had at once suspected a dawning passion on the part of this man, then that Termonde had gone away on a long journey, and that he, my father, had attributed his absence to the loyalty of a sincere friend, to a noble effort to fight from the first against a criminal feeling.  Termonde came back; his visits to us were soon resumed, and they became more frequent than before.  There was every reason for this; my father had been his chum at the Ecole de Droit, and would have chosen him to be his best man at his marriage had not Termonde's diplomatic functions kept him out of France at the time.  In this letter and the following ones my father acknowledged that he had been strongly attached to Termonde, so much so, indeed, that he had considered his own jealousy as an unworthy feeling and a sort of treachery.  But it is all very well to reproach one's self for a passion; it is there in our hearts all the same, tearing and devouring them.  After Termonde's return, my father's jealousy increased, with the certainty that the man's love for the wife of his friend was also growing; and yet, the unhappy husband did not think himself entitled to forbid him the house. Was not his wife the most pure and upright of women?  Her very inclination to mysticism and exaggerated devotion, although he sometimes found fault with her for it, was a pledge that she would never yield to anything by which her conscience could be stained. Besides, Termonde's assiduity was accompanied by such evident, such absolute respect, that it afforded no ground for reproach.  What was he to do?  Have an explanation with his wife--he who could not bring himself to enter upon the slightest discussion with her? Require her to decline to receive his own friend?  But, if she yielded, he would have deprived her of a real pleasure, and for that he should be unable to forgive himself.  If she did not yield? So, my poor father had preferred to toss about in that Gehenna of weakness and indecision wherein dwell timid and taciturn souls. All this misery he revealed to my aunt, dwelling upon the morbid nature of his feelings, imploring advice and pity, deciding and blaming the puerility of his jealousy, but jealous all the same, unable to refrain from recurring again and again to the open wound in his heart, and incapable of the energy and decision that would have cured it. The letters became more and more gloomy, as it always happens when one has not at once put an end to a false position; my father suffered from the consequences of his weakness, and allowed them to develop without taking action, because he could not now have checked them without painful scenes.  After having tolerated the increased frequency of his friend's visits, it was torture to him to observe that his wife was sensibly influenced by this encroaching intimacy.  He perceived that she took Termonde's advice on all little matters of daily life--upon a question of dress, the purchase of a present, the choice of a book.  He came upon the traces of the man in the change of my mother's tastes, in music for instance.  When we were alone in the evenings, he liked her to go to the piano and play to him, for hours together, at haphazard; now she would play nothing but pieces selected by Termonde, who had acquired an extensive knowledge of the German masters during his residence abroad.  My father, on the contrary, having been brought up in the country with his sister, who was herself taught by a provincial music-master, retained his old-fashioned taste for Italian music. My mother belonged, by her own family, to a totally different sphere of society from that into which her marriage with my father had introduced her.  At first she did not feel any regret for her former circle, because her extreme beauty secured her a triumphant success in the new one; but it was another thing when her intimacy with Termonde, who moved in the most worldly and elegant of the Parisian \\\"world,\\\" was perpetually reminding her of all its pleasures and habits.  My father saw that she was bored and weary while doing the honors of her own salon with an absent mind.  He even found the political opinions of his friend echoed by his wife, who laughed at him for what she called his Utopian liberalism.  Her mockery had no malice in it; but still it was mockery, and behind it was Termonde, always Termonde.  Nevertheless, he said nothing, and the shyness, which he had always felt in my mother's presence increased with his jealousy.  The more unhappy he was, the more incapable of expressing his pain he became.  There are minds so constituted that suffering paralzes them into inaction.  And then there was the ever-present question, what was he to do?  How was he to approach an explanation, when he had no positive accusation to bring?  He remained perfectly convinced of the fidelity of his wife, and he again and again affirmed this, entreating my aunt not to withdraw a particle of her esteem from his dear Marie, and imploring her never to make an allusion to the sufferings of which he was ashamed, before their innocent cause.  And then he dwelt upon his own faults; he accused himself of lack of tenderness, of failing to win love, and would draw pictures of his sorrowful home, in a few words, with heart-rending humility. Rough, commonplace minds know nothing of the scruples that rent and tortured my father's soul.  They say, \\\"I am jealous,\\\" without troubling themselves as to whether the words convey an insult or not.  They forbid the house to the person to whom they object, and shut their wives mouths with, \\\"Am I master here?\\\" taking heed of their own feelings merely.  Are they in the right?  I know not; I only know that such rough methods were impossible to my poor father.  He had sufficient strength to assume an icy mien towards Termonde, to address him as seldom as possible, to give him his hand with the insulting politeness that makes a gulf between two sincere friends; but Termonde affected unconsciousness of all this. My father, who did not want to have a scene with him, because the immediate consequence would have been another scene with my mother, multiplied these small affronts, and then Termonde simply changed the time of his visits, and came during my father's business hours. How vividly my father depicted his stormy rage at the idea that his wife and the man of whom he was jealous were talking together, undisturbed, in the flower-decked salon, while he was toiling to procure all the luxury that money could purchase for that wife who could never, never love him, although he believed her faithful. But, oh, that cold fidelity was not what he longed for--he who ended his letter by these words--how often have I repeated them to myself: \\\"It is so sad to feel that one is in the way in one's own house, that one possesses a woman by every right, that she gives one all that her duty obliges her to give, all, except her heart, which is another's unknown to herself, perhaps, unless, indeed, that--  My sister, there are terrible hours in which I say to myself that I am a fool, a coward, that they laugh together at me, at my blindness, my stupid trust.  Do not scold me, dear Louise.  This idea is infamous, and I drive it away by taking refuge with you, to whom, at least, I am all the world.\\\" \\\"Unless, indeed, that--\\\"  This letter was written on the first Sunday in June, 1864; and on the following Thursday, four days later, he who had written it, and had suffered all it revealed, went out to the appointment at which he met with his mysterious death, that death by which his wife was set free to marry his felon friend.  What was the idea, as dreadful, as infamous as the idea of which my father accused himself in his terrible last letter, that flashed across me now?  I placed the packet of papers upon the mantelpiece, and pressed my two hands to my head, as though to still the tempest of cruel fancies which made it throb with fever. Ah, the hideous, nameless thing!  My mind got a glimpse of it only to reject it. But, had not my aunt also been assailed by the same monstrous suspicion?  A number of small facts rose up in my memory, and convinced me that my father's faithful sister had been a prey to the same idea which had just laid hold of me so strongly.  How many strange things I now understood, all in a moment!  On that day when she told me of my mother's second marriage, and I spontaneously uttered the accursed name of Termonde, why had she asked me, in a trembling voice: \\\"What do you know?\\\" What was it she feared that I had guessed?  What dreaded information did she expect to receive from my childish observation of things? Afterwards, and when she implored me to abandon the task of avenging our beloved dead, when she quoted to me the sacred words, \\\"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord,\\\" who were the guilty ones whom she foresaw I must meet on my path?  When she entreated me to bear with my stepfather, even to conciliate him, not to make an enemy of him, had her advice any object except the greater ease of my daily life, or did she think danger might come to me from that quarter? When she became more afraid for me, owing to the weakening of her brain by illness, and again and again enjoined upon me to beware of going out alone in the evening, was the vision of terror that came to her that of a hand which would fain strike me in the dark--the same hand that had struck my father?  When she summoned up all her strength in her last moments, that she might destroy this correspondence, what was the clue which she supposed the letters would furnish?  A terrific light shone upon me; what my aunt had perceived beyond the plain purport of the letters, I too perceived. Ah! I dared to entertain this idea, yet now I am ashamed to write it down.  But could I have escaped from the hard logic of the situation?  If my aunt had handed over those letters to the Judge of Instruction in the matter, would he not have arrived at the same conclusion that I drew from them?  No, I could not.  A man who has no known enemies is assassinated; it is alleged that robbery is not the motive of the murder; his wife has a lover, and shortly after the death of her husband she marries that lover.  \\\"But it is they-- it is they who are guilty, they have killed the husband,\\\" the judge would say, and so would the first-comer.  Why did not my aunt place those letters of my father's in the hands of justice?  I understood the reason too well; she would not have me think of my mother what I was now in a fit of distraction thinking. To conceive of this as merely possible was to be guilty of moral parricide, to commit the inexpiable sin against her who had borne me.  I had always loved my mother so tenderly, so mournfully; never, never had I judged her.  How many times--happening to be alone with her, and not knowing how to tell her what was weighing on my heart--how many times I had dreamed that the barrier between us would not for ever divide us.  Some day I might, perhaps, become her only support, then she should see how precious she still was to me.  My sufferings had not lessened my love for her; wretched as I was because she refused me a certain sort of affection, I did not condemn her for lavishing that affection upon another.  As a matter of fact, until those fatal letters had done their work of disenchantment, of what was she guilty in my eyes?  Of having married again?  Of having chosen, being left a widow at thirty, to construct a new life for herself?  What could be more legitimate? Of having failed to understand the relations of the child who remained to her with the man whom she had chosen?  What was more natural?  She was more wife than mother, and besides, fanciful and fragile beings such as she was recoil from daily contests; they shrink from facing realities which would demand sustained courage and energy on their part.  I had admitted all these explanations of my mother's attitude towards me, at first from instinct and afterwards on reflection.  But now, the inexhaustible spring of indulgence for those who really hold our heart-strings was dried up in a moment, and a flood of odious, abominable suspicion overwhelmed me instead. This sudden invasion of a horrible, torturing idea was not lasting. I could not have borne it.  Had it implanted itself in me then and there, definite, overwhelming in evidence, impossible of rejection, I must have taken a pistol and shot myself, to escape from agony such as I endured in the few minutes which followed my reading of the letters.  But the tension was relaxed, I reflected, and my love for my mother began to strive against the horrible suggestion.  To the onslaught of these execrable fancies I opposed the facts, in their certainty and completeness.  I recalled the smallest particulars of that last occasion on which I saw my father and mother in each other's presence.  It was at the table from which he rose to go forth and meet his murderer.  But was not my mother cheerful and smiling that morning, as usual?  Was not Jacques Termonde with us at breakfast, and did he not stay on, after my father had gone out, talking with my mother while I played with my toys in the room?  It was at that very time, between one and two o'clock, that the mysterious Rochdale committed the crime. Termonde could not be, at one and the same moment, in our salon and at the Imperial Hotel, any more than my mother, impressionable and emotional as I knew her to be, could have gone on talking quietly and happily, if she had known that her husband was being murdered at that very hour.  Why, I must have been mad to allow such a notion to present its monstrous image before my eyes for a single moment, and it was infamous of me to have gone so far beyond the most insulting of my father's suspicions. Already, and without any proof except the expression of jealousy acknowledged by himself to be unreasonable, I had reached a point to which the unhappy but still loving man had not dared to go, even to the extreme outrage against my mother.  What if, during the lifetime of her first husband, she had inspired him whom she was one day to marry with too strong a sentiment, did this prove that she had shared it?  If she had shared it, would that have proved her to be a fallen woman?  Why should she not have entertained an affection for Termonde, which, while it in no wise interfered with her fidelity to her wifely duties, made my father not unnaturally jealous? Thus did I justify her, not only from any participation in the crime, but from any failure in her duty.  And then again my ideas changed; I remembered the cry that she had uttered in presence of my father's dead body: \\\"I am punished by God!\\\"  I was not sufficiently charitable to her to admit that those words might be merely the utterance of a refined and scrupulous mind which reproached itself even with its thoughts.  I also recalled the gleaming eyes and shaking hands of Termonde, when he was talking with my mother about my father's mysterious disappearance.  If they were accomplices, this was a piece of acting performed before me, an innocent witness, so that they might invoke my childish testimony on occasion.  These recollections once more drove me upon my fated way.  The idea of a guilty tie between her and him now took possession of me, and then came swiftly the thought that they had profited by the murder, that they alone had an engrossing interest in it.  So violent was the assault of suspicion that it overthrew all the barriers I had raised against it.  I accumulated all the objections founded upon a physical alibi and a moral improbability, and thence I forced myself to say it was, strictly speaking, impossible they could have anything to do with the murder; impossible, impossible!  I repeated this frantically; but even as it passed my lips, the hallucination returned, and struck me down.  There are moments when the disordered mind is unable to quell visions which it knows to be false, when the imaginary and the real mingle in a nightmare-panic, and the judgment is powerless to distinguish between them.  Who is there that, having been jealous, does not know this condition of mind?  What did I not suffer from it during the day after I had read those letters!  I wandered about the house, incapable of attending to any duty, struck stupid by emotions which all around me attributed to grief for my aunt's death.  Several times I tried to sit for a while beside her bed; but the sight of her pale face, with its pinched nostrils, and its deepening expression of sadness, was unbearable to me.  It renewed my miserable doubts. At four o'clock I received a telegram.  It was from my mother, and announced her arrival by evening train.  When the slip of blue paper was in my hand my wretchedness was for a moment relieved. She was coming.  She had thought of my trouble; she was coming. That assurance \\\\[error in text--line missing\\\\] criminal thoughts in my face? But those absurd and infamous notions took possession of me once more.  Perhaps she thinks, so ran my thoughts, that the correspondence between my father and my aunt had not been destroyed, and she is coming in order to get hold of those letters before I see them, and to find out what my aunt said to me when she was dying.  If she and Termonde are guilty, they must have lived in constant dread of the old maid's penetration.  Ah! I had been very unhappy in my childhood, but how gladly would I have gone back to be the school-boy, meditating during the dull and interminable evening hours of study, and not the young man who walked to and fro that night in the station at Compiegne, awaiting the arrival of a mother, suspected as mine was.  Just God!  Did not I expiate everything in anticipation by that one hour?\",\"timestamp\":1639709046,\"title\":\"\\nMy good old Julie was waiting for me at the station.
