"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"If you want to be the strong, then you have to understand that on the road to the strong, you can only rely on yourself. Parents, relatives, friends, and colleagues are unreliable. Because you want to be strong, this is a lonely road. Your mind must be incomprehensible to mortals. If your relatives and friends are mortals, they will become emotional and hurt your mind.\\n\\nFor example, today, my parents think that I am very arrogant, arrogant, and think that I have many shortcomings that need to be corrected immediately. I want to say that everyone has many, many shortcomings, but there is no need to correct them. I only pay attention to my strengths, and I use my strengths every hour. Connecting 24 hours is an excellent day. 365 If the sky is connected, it is an excellent year, and the 100 years connected is that the strengths will be used for a lifetime, and you will be an excellent person. Why should I listen to those who make less money than me and change myself?\\n\\nEvery strong person has a strong and stubborn heart. Only by maintaining this heart can you live a strong and stubborn life. The strong do not need the appreciation of the weak. Whether they climb to the peak of life or not, the strong only need to take care of themselves, appreciate themselves, encourage themselves, and cheer for themselves.\\n\\nDo not bow to any ignorant and violent thoughts or ideologies. Do not participate in nonsense conversations of low-level people. My relatives and friends always advise me to keep a low profile and learn to be gentle. Why should they persuade me? In fact, they don't know it themselves. The answer is simple. No one likes heterogeneous. A good person is heterogeneous. These people subconsciously want me to be exactly like them and make me identify with their thoughts. However, this will never be possible. If my ideology is the same as theirs, I will never get their attention, and I will never make more money.\\n\\nIn fact, there are many people who originally had an excellent dream, but one of them became strong in their hearts.\\n\\nSeed of the winner. However, my relatives, friends, and even my spouse suppressed my soul in the name of \\\"love\\\".\\n\\nWe successful entrepreneurs all have a trait, we are destined to be alone. I am gifted to enjoy these things because I want to gather the same people to collide together, to be able to cherish each other, and to make the soul no longer so lonely. Why did ancient kings catch another king, and few killed them right away? How many words do you have to talk about? Because of loneliness, but also because of sympathy.\",\"timestamp\":1634795092,\"title\":\"The soul of every hero is lonely, every king is\\n\\nFew people!\"},\"digest\":\"EGdozWAx3NBobVc9DAKLm-KJgWAzKRc-1Yv47mMy2AI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0500e3b6f7b1214a11851b9B348020C08018403b\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Pri9rblXjWa-KlEIg_9rZEZnJfDNvb5Pn3Pnn2Xrr1aNS7CETVd3m3xj7pevPg8aCom2tNJ9qBJSMryzoTaM0Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x1c6f856baad7dbcdc04a289cfb8c27fd2d4c254469eae7a6d5e283ce19250e091ab85676074d27b49e23c7d4b78b5f81e8536a0da448b30920c0f4dc5a6602e41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nKf8ZamRyX8cLVb8DeIErgOMrQgMun7f02Hq_yDPgjE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"3htkpr16jLLCk2n5vgcjMXkGx9Ypl9sCU0ngm5GUXu8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EGdozWAx3NBobVc9DAKLm-KJgWAzKRc-1Yv47mMy2AI\"}"
