"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**1999 The Internet 1.0**\\n\\n**10 years old, with each passing day, it became less of a library.**\\n\\nThe web went from static to dynamic, slow then accelerating.\\n\\n**A read-only monochrome landscape was gathering color, motion, and memory.**\\n\\nThose who knew took what they learned from the cloistered content communities inside big iron academic boxes.\\n\\nThey took from usenet chat, and from the early walled cities with their maniured gardens of games, news, and chat. They headed off on their bicycles of the mind to the wild of the Internet.\\n\\nThe pioneers, and the young, headed out to the open network, and planted the first of billions of nodes in the Internet. Many colonies were founded but ony a few lasted.\\n\\n**It was a Read Only Microverse of static fertile fields, hypertext was a mycelian network which bound together this new world, their links under the surface of each page of the microverse.**\\n\\nThe best readers and routers were still the two legged kind.\\n\\nThe machines were just beginning to cast their nets and trawl the new ocean. These Web-Trawlers were primitive ocean going vessels. (Like ALI from CERN in 1993.)\\n\\nBut it was new, and anything new can be the vessel for our imagination. Our imagination can transform a seed into a sapling, and a sapling into a forest.\\n\\n**Pioneers returned from distant lands stored in faraway machines, and returned with more of the \\\"new\\\", seeds of the future.**\\n\\n**That was enough to convince many to head out, and never return.**\\n\\n**2877, Earth, The Necklace**\\n\\nThe moment I exited the consulate, someone stepped outside of one of the floaters parked outside.\\n\\nJust 3 days after the fight, her arm was on longer in a sling.\\n\\nEye contact. I got in the backseat.\\n\\n\\\"Foundry district\\\", she gestured to her arm, \\\"Military nanos. Your friend is safe.\\\"\\n\\nThe floater left the diplomatic quarter, past the marketplace square, and flew over a landscape that was part-war museum and part-construction site. The war factories were dismantling themselves.\\n\\nWe landed in the middle of an old co-op campus. Moments later, I was inside an office, so was the \\\"messenger\\\" I fought 3 days ago.\\n\\n**Some of the pieces connected in my mind:**\\n\\nShe's not a messenger, she's young, this shadow co-op was an old crew.She’s not in charge but is shooting for the job.Or she’s in charge and got rid of the old boss.They brought Andreea into the office.They didn’t blindfold me on the way here.That’s a problem.\\n\\n\\\"Are you alright?\\\" It looked like Andreea was unharmed. She nodded.\\n\\n\\\"Nobody touched her. We were just waiting for you to join us\\\" said the Messenger.\\n\\n\\\"Here is what you want.\\\" I handed over the device.\\n\\nThe messenger put it on the table's interface, the room lit up, she was mesmerized by the data flows. She seemed to forget us.\\n\\n\\\"There's nothing like this. Nobody has this. No crew, no co-op has this. It's too bad, that I don't believe this is all of it. Tie them up.”\\n\\nIt was going to be torture this time if I let it happen.Nothing to lose, it was time for another fight.Then the room exploded in light.Was it the police?\\n\\nSomeone walked in.\\n\\n**”Someone stole from my employer. The Dowager sends her regards.”**\\n\\n[https://audius.co/rodrigodtamay/mycelium-2](https://audius.co/rodrigodtamay/mycelium-2)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ivjn8EpKb_gJtbGr4I2qo.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/SGSf-Yv_6v51kr91CvJ9b.png?height=1600&width=1200)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1636225408,\"title\":\"1999 7.29 Launched Past The Point of New Returns\"},\"digest\":\"HPlfg82Ed22bth5921uvy1a1-PLLc0QrfCUyEz0NkqY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x3d4508Df93241e092825Bf72d205eb317121f43f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"oixhkXNKq8hvUDhF10ks8zQbwbsxFpvYtFLbSE7z0FvPBv1LY8RuvcABFBAgrfzuBi3ZuEHnyPaDDNg4wNZN9Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xe4c1bcaa88b6fe2c67d195f4a76d1a91640647a2c63ec8f8083673f941e8ee412d804077222237104c51130677298bdcb163cbc3b2eb0bb6193f6b825a8e06141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"cp69EkVmGPN56udTPoj_01QpW6eGaXZ1zbeS531jad8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"zYwhIf2jaKC_Er3nNncHMRuE7eXBXlkdLz-3zM8ikGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"4Lf1SiWkl7usVlbQkB_FP3rHawhgFbWr8pxaVPRcBk4\"}"
