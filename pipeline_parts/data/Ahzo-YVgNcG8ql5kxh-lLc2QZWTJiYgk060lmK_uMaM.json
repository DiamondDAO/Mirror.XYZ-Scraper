You can think of it as an experiment in [universal creator income](https://li.substack.com/p/the-case-for-universal-creative-income), [tech stacks for decentralized cities](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4), and the physical [manifestation of DAOs](https://twitter.com/jongold/status/1395390112205352962?s=20).\\n\\n`\\nEMBED \\n\\nCROWDFUND\\n\\n`\\n\\nThis is a crowdfund for one year of cumulative time living and building at Creator Cabins in the Texas Hill Country. We're situated on 28 acres of land about 45 minutes from downtown Austin, and we just built a new cabin designed as a collaborative co-living and working space for independent online creators. Our cabins are the first nodes in what we hope will one day be a [decentralized city](https://www.meatspacealgorithms.com/decentralized-cities/):\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/aff070f7-1ccb-4868-8a53-64505c093fee.jpg?height=1174&width=1710)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/f7f4c3a9-0d4d-4403-8a28-23432eb32a98.jpg?height=1286&width=1954)\\n\\n[The land & cabins are our hardware](https://creators.mirror.xyz/-lNPJRz2GLWIcsuMTZqklGNEWRrY7Nk0Y33Qn6Lw4q4). Now we're starting to experiment with on-chain governance software. We will set up CabinDAO to manage this crowdfund. All contributors will be awarded $CABIN tokens, which can be used to vote for creator residency proposals. While the DAO will ultimately govern the use of the funds, here's a rough sketch of how we are thinking about structuring the program:\\n\\n## CabinDAO\\n\\nWe want to crowdfund 12 months' worth of time at the cabins. This would allow $CABIN holders to vote and fund 12 creators to come for a one-month stay each. The new cabin has four bedrooms, so we would run three cohorts of four creators each.\\n\\nThe DAO will set up an open application process (perhaps similar to $WRITE RACE), and the winners will be invited to Creator Cabins outside of Austin, TX to work on their proposals. At the end of the month, we will help each creator mint an NFT representing their residency. The NFTs could be held and curated by the CabinDAO treasury or sold back to the community with a split of the proceeds going to the artist and the DAO.\\n\\nThis project came together over the course of a two-week stay at Creator Cabins by members of [creator.coop](https://creator.coop). We didn't go into our stay intending to make this——the plan emerged from two weeks of co-working, co-living, and co-creating at the cabins. Everyone came into their time at the cabins with projects they wanted to finish, but late-night conversations around the fire got us all inspired to build something much bigger.  We hope this residency program can help inspire more collaborative projects like this one.\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2c1549c9-0d03-4b4e-914c-d50f07800d22.jpg?height=1284&width=1932)\\n\\n\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### Who is eligible for a residency?\\n\\nAnyone creating independently and sharing their work online. We take a broad view of the term “creator”: digital artists, musicians, landscape sculptors, video producers, indie hackers, home builders, painters, photographers, podcasters, open-source developers, map makers, online course builders. If you’re building something that you hope to share back with the world, then you probably fit the bill. We expect projects that help push the boundaries of Web3 and/or contribute to the ongoing sustainability of the DAO will be more likely to win, but that will be up to $CABIN holders to decide.\\n\\n\\n### How do I apply? \\n\\nOnce the crowdfund is complete, the DAO will run an open process for selecting applicants. [If you're interested in being notified about that process, opt-in here](https://creatorcabins.ck.page/9e628caec5).\\n\\n\\n### How will the money be spent?\\n\\nAll money raised by the DAO will be used to fund residencies at Creator Cabins. We are budgeting 1/3rd of an ETH per creator-week, so 16 ETH can fund 3 cohorts (12 creators for a total of 48 weeks at the cabins). \\n \\n\\n### What happens with the other 50% of $CABIN?\\n\\nThe DAO will retain 50% of $CABIN tokens to give to artists upon completion of their residencies, future supporters of the residency program, and whoever else CabinDAO decides to grant them to.\\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1df7adbe-3a5c-49e0-95f2-d9af9e8c364e.jpg?height=1298&width=1946)\\n\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/27723c84-ba7e-4cf2-b133-6b843455ecd1.jpg?height=1284&width=1950)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/2a3ce5da-5f6d-4ce6-974a-83006b9ddcd4.jpg?height=1308&width=1960)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/39edd82a-9a14-4f91-9442-79e59c11eb5b.jpg?height=1292&width=1940)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/d8aca6bb-3fd6-457a-987e-c606089a5907.jpg?height=1254&width=1932)\\n\\n**Acknowledgements:** *We're deeply grateful for the thoughts, ideas, support, feedback, encouragement, and advice we've received from the community over the past few weeks.
