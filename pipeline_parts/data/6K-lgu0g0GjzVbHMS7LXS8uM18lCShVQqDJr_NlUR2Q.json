"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Wasting no time, giving her no chance to change her mind, little Jon got into the bed, which seemed much softer than his own.  He heaved another sigh, screwed his head into the pillow and lay examining the battle of chariots and swords and spears which always went on outside blankets, where the little hairs stood up against the light.\\n\\n\\\"It wasn't anything, really, was it?\\\" he said.\\n\\n> From before her glass his mother answered:\\n\\n\\\"Nothing but the moon and your imagination heated up.  You mustn't get so excited, Jon.\\\"\\n\\nBut, still not quite in possession of his nerves, little Jon answered boastfully:\\n\\n\\\"I wasn't afraid, really, of course!\\\"  And again he lay watching the spears and chariots.  It all seemed very long.\\n\\n\\\"Oh! Mum, do hurry up!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Darling, I have to plait my hair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh! not to-night.  You'll only have to unplait it again to-morrow. I'm sleepy now; if you don't come, I shan't be sleepy soon.\\\"\\n\\nHis mother stood up white and flowey before the winged mirror: he could see three of her, with her neck turned and her hair bright under the light, and her dark eyes smiling.  It was unnecessary, and he said:\\n\\n\\\"Do come, Mum; I'm waiting.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very well, my love, I'll come.\\\"\\n\\nLittle Jon closed his eyes.  Everything was turning out most satisfactory, only she must hurry up!  He felt the bed shake, she was getting in.  And, still with his eyes closed, he said sleepily: \\\"It's nice, isn't it?\\\"\\n\\nHe heard her voice say something, felt her lips touching his nose, and, snuggling up beside her who lay awake and loved him with her thoughts, he fell into the dreamless sleep, which rounded off his past.\\n\\nTO LET\\n\\n\\\"From out the fatal loins of those two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life.\\\"                         --Romeo and Juliet.\\n\\nTO CHARLES SCRIBNER\\n\\nPART I\\n\\nENCOUNTER\\n\\nSoames Forsyte emerged from the Knightsbridge Hotel, where he was staying, in the afternoon of the 12th of May, 1920, with the intention of visiting a collection of pictures in a Gallery off Cork Street, and looking into the Future.  He walked.  Since the War he never took a cab if he could help it.  Their drivers were, in his view, an uncivil lot, though now that the War was over and supply beginning to exceed demand again, getting more civil in accordance with the custom of human nature.  Still, he had not forgiven them, deeply identifying them with gloomy memories, and now, dimly, like all members, of their class, with revolution.  The considerable anxiety he had passed through during the War, and the more considerable anxiety he had since undergone in the Peace, had produced psychological consequences in a tenacious nature.  He had, mentally, so frequently experienced ruin, that he had ceased to believe in its material probability.  Paying away four thousand a year in income and super tax, one could not very well be worse off! A fortune of a quarter of a million, encumbered only by a wife and one daughter, and very diversely invested, afforded substantial guarantee even against that \\\"wildcat notion\\\" a levy on capital.  And as to confiscation of war profits, he was entirely in favour of it, for he had none, and \\\"serve the beggars right!\\\" The price of pictures, moreover, had, if anything, gone up, and he had done better with his collection since the War began than ever before.  Air-raids, also, had acted beneficially on a spirit congenitally cautious, and hardened a character already dogged.  To be in danger of being entirely dispersed inclined one to be less apprehensive of the more partial dispersions involved in levies and taxation, while the habit of condemning the impudence of the Germans had led naturally to condemning that of Labour, if not openly at least in the sanctuary of his soul.\\n\\nHe walked.  There was, moreover, time to spare, for Fleur was to meet him at the Gallery at four o'clock, and it was as yet but half-past two.  It was good for him to walk--his liver was a little constricted, and his nerves rather on edge.  His wife was always out when she was in Town, and his daughter would flibberty-gibbet all over the place like most young women since the War.  Still, he must be thankful that she had been too young to do anything in that War itself.  Not, of course, that he had not supported the War from its inception, with all his soul, but between that and supporting it with the bodies of his wife and daughter, there had been a gap fixed by something old-fashioned within him which abhorred emotional extravagance.  He had, for instance, strongly objected to Annette, so attractive, and in 1914 only thirty-four, going to her native France, her \\\"chere patrie\\\" as, under the stimulus of war, she had begun to call it, to nurse her \\\"braves poilus,\\\" forsooth!  Ruining her health and her looks!  As if she were really a nurse!  He had put a stopper on it.  Let her do needlework for them at home, or knit!  She had not gone, therefore, and had never been quite the same woman since.  A bad tendency of hers to mock at him, not openly, but in continual little ways, had grown.  As for Fleur, the War had resolved the vexed problem whether or not she should go to school.  She was better away from her mother in her war mood, from the chance of air-raids, and the impetus to do extravagant things; so he had placed her in a seminary as far West as had seemed to him compatibIe with excellence, and had missed her horribly.  Fleur!  He had never regretted the somewhat outlandish name by which at her birth he had decided so suddenly to call her--marked concession though it had been to the French.  Fleur!  A pretty name--a pretty child!  But restless--too restless; and wilful!  Knowing her power too over her father!  Soames often reflected on the mistake it was to dote on his daughter.  To get old and dote!  Sixty-five!  He was getting on; but he didn't feel it, for, fortunately perhaps, considering Annette's youth and good looks, his second marriage had turned out a cool affair.  He had known but one real passion in his life--for that first wife of his-- Irene.  Yes, and that fellow, his cousin Jolyon, who had gone off with her, was looking very shaky, they said.  No wonder, at seventy- two, after twenty years of a third marriage!\\n\\nSoames paused a moment in his march to lean over the railings of the Row.  A suitable spot for reminiscence, half-way between that house in Park Lane which had seen his birth and his parents' deaths, and the little house in Montpellier Square where thirty-five years ago he had enjoyed his first edition of matrimony.  Now, after twenty years of his second edition, that old tragedy seemed to him like a previous existence--which had ended when Fleur was born in place of the son he had hoped for.  For many years he had ceased regretting, even vaguely, the son who had not been born; Fleur filled the bill in his heart.  After all, she bore his name; and he was not looking forward at all to the time when she would change it.  Indeed, if he ever thought of such a calamity, it was seasoned by the vague feeling that he could make her rich enough to purchase perhaps and extinguish the name of the fellow who married her--why not, since, as it seemed, women were equal to men nowadays?  And Soames, secretly convinced that they were not, passed his curved hand over his face vigorously, till it reached the comfort of his chin.  Thanks to abstemious habits, he had not grown fat and gabby; his nose was pale and thin, his grey moustache close-clipped, his eyesight unimpaired.  A slight stoop closened and corrected the expansion given to his face by the heightening of his forehead in the recession of his grey hair. Little change had Time wrought in the \\\"warmest\\\" of the young Forsytes, as the last of the old Forsytes--Timothy-now in his hundred and first year, would have phrased it.\\n\\nThe shade from the plane-trees fell on his neat Homburg hat; he had given up top hats--it was no use attracting attention to wealth in days like  these.  Plane-trees!  His thoughts travelled sharply to Madrid--the Easter before the War, when, having to make up his mind about that Goya picture, he had taken a voyage of discovery to study the painter on his spot.  The fellow had impressed him--great range, real genius!  Highly as the chap ranked, he would rank even higher before they had finished with him.  The second Goya craze would be greater even than the first; oh, yes!  And he had bought.  On that visit he had--as never before--commissioned a copy of a fresco painting called \\\"La Vendimia,\\\" wherein was the figure of a girl with an arm akimbo, who had reminded him of his daughter.  He had it now in the Gallery at Mapledurham, and rather poor it was--you couldn't copy Goya.  He would still look at it, however, if his daughter were not there, for the sake of something irresistibly reminiscent in the light, erect balance of the figure, the width between the arching eyebrows, the eager dreaming of the dark eyes.  Curious that Fleur should have dark eyes, when his own were grey--no pure Forsyte had brown eyes--and her mother's blue!  But of course her grandmother Lamotte's eyes were dark as treacle!\\n\\nHe began to walk on again toward Hyde Park Corner.  No greater change in all England than in the Row!  Born almost within hail of it, he could remember it from 1860 on.  Brought there as a child between the crinolines to stare at tight-trousered dandies in whiskers, riding with a cavalry seat; to watch the doffing of curly-brimmed and white top hats; the leisurely air of it all, and the little bow-legged man in a long red waistcoat who used to come among the fashion with dogs on several strings, and try to sell one to his mother: King Charles spaniels, Italian greyhounds, affectionate to her crinoline--you never saw them now.  You saw no quality of any sort, indeed, just working people sitting in dull rows with nothing to stare at but a few young bouncing females in pot hats, riding astride, or desultory Colonials charging up and down on dismal-looking hacks; with, here and there, little girls on ponies, or old gentlemen jogging their livers, or an orderly trying a great galumphing cavalry horse; no thoroughbreds, no grooms, no bowing, no scraping, no gossip--nothing; only the trees the same--the trees in--different to the generations and declensions of mankind.  A democratic England--dishevelled, hurried, noisy, and seemingly without an apex.  And that something fastidious in the soul of Soames turned over within him.  Gone forever, the close borough of rank and polish!  Wealth there was--oh, yes!  wealth--he himself was a richer man than his father had ever been; but manners, flavour, quality, all gone, engulfed in one vast, ugly, shoulder-rubbing, petrol-smelling Cheerio.  Little half-beaten pockets of gentility and caste lurking here and there, dispersed and chetif, as Annette would say; but nothing ever again firm and coherent to look up to.  And into this new hurly-burly of bad manners and loose morals his daughter--flower of his life--was flung!  And when those Labour chaps got power--if they ever did--the worst was yet to come.\\n\\nHe passed out under the archway, at last no longer--thank goodness!-- disfigured by the gungrey of its search-light.  'They'd better put a search-light on to where they're all going,' he thought, 'and light up their precious democracy!' And he directed his steps along the Club fronts of Piccadilly.  George Forsyte, of course, would be sitting in the bay window of the Iseeum.  The chap was so big now that he was there nearly all his time, like some immovable, sardonic, humorous eye noting the decline of men and things.  And Soames hurried, ever constitutionally uneasy beneath his cousin's glance. George, who, as he had heard, had written a letter signed \\\"Patriot\\\" in the middle of the War, complaining of the Government's hysteria in docking the oats of race-horses.  Yes, there he was, tall, ponderous, neat, clean-shaven, with his smooth hair, hardly thinned, smelling, no doubt, of the best hair-wash, and a pink paper in his hand.  Well, be didn't change!  And for perhaps the first time in his life Soames felt a kind of sympathy tapping in his waistcoat for that sardonic kinsman.  With his weight, his perfectly parted hair, and bull-like gaze, he was a guarantee that the old order would take some shifting yet.  He saw George move the pink paper as if inviting him to ascend- -the chap must want to ask something about his property.  It was still under Soames' control; for in the adoption of a sleeping partnership at that painful period twenty years back when he had divorced Irene, Soames had found himself almost insensibly retaining control of all purely Forsyte affairs.\\n\\nHesitating for just a moment, he nodded and went in.  Since the death of his brother-in-law Montague Dartie, in Paris, which no one had quite known what to make of, except that it was certainly not suicide--the Iseeum Club had seemed more respectable to Soames. George, too, he knew, had sown the last of his wild oats, and was committed definitely to the joys of the table, eating only of the very best so as to keep his weight down, and owning, as he said, \\\"just one or two old screws to give me an interest in life.\\\"  He joined his cousin, therefore, in the bay window without the embarrassing sense of indiscretion he had been used to feel up there. George put out a well-kept hand.\\n\\n\\\"Haven't seen you since the War,\\\" he said.  \\\"How's your wife?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Thanks,\\\" said Soames coldly, \\\"well enough.\\\"\\n\\nSome hidden jest curved, for a moment, George's fleshy face, and gloated from his eye.\\n\\n\\\"That Belgian chap, Profond,\\\" he said, \\\"is a member here now.  He's a rum customer.\\\"\",\"timestamp\":1639989715,\"title\":\"\\\"Which side of the bed do you like, Mum?\\\"\"},\"digest\":\"bQh_L5eKUmTeSXeVH_FmriROR7ijBW5Ab6ap0zDT39U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa216D8906Acd104a8EC6a31f93e945DFe15768c1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Uf75fmKVVPERYpIlutftjTuY518LdOOuh6jINnS9c10\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IgZcMHO75iqEWj4CM001v2C8Oa3HJknndytzSrFqsKY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"sOwKDD88R3PKBdLJZORLWiuyEK3_CKJmo6AzPM-3uW0sfzbWfpQLJlGJW_e3_58vYPWNtHUGKBbB8qgjP6sE3w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa6406305b601707ff6de3073288113ad354760c9162116273686f73674ec27fb0b35df6de307219e0427487acd59d290e4451c4ce333900634c335adef60464e1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Uf75fmKVVPERYpIlutftjTuY518LdOOuh6jINnS9c10\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"IgZcMHO75iqEWj4CM001v2C8Oa3HJknndytzSrFqsKY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"bQh_L5eKUmTeSXeVH_FmriROR7ijBW5Ab6ap0zDT39U\"}"
