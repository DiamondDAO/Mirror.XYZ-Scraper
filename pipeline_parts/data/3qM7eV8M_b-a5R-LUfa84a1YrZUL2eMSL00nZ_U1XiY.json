Profits generated from those sales will be split 50% with the contributing artist, with 40% going to the Holly+ DAO Treasury to fund new tools, and 10% going to me for the use of my likeness. üßÆ\\n\\nWe hope to create a virtuous cycle ‚ôæÔ∏è where artists are compensated for their experiments with Holly+, new tools can get funded to allow more artists to experiment, and I receives some compensation for my contribution. \\n\\nIf those NFTs are resold on the secondary market, a 10% royalty will be split 50/40/10 between the original artist, Holly+ DAO and Holly too! \\n\\nI hope that this model can help challenge the often pessimistic narrative around ‚Äúdeepfakes‚Äù, and encourage more people to become interested in performing works through the identity of others! ü•∏\\n\\nThis technology is exciting and challenging, and rather than concentrating on ways to limit experimentation by artists I would rather find ways for everyone to have fun, get paid for officially approved work, and contribute to more tools being made!\\n\\nRead more about the Holly+ project https://holly.mirror.xyz/54ds2IiOnvthjGFkokFCoaI4EabytH9xjAYy1irHy94\\n\\nSubmission Guidelines\\n\\nPlease make sure that you own the work (both audio and visual) that you are submitting! You can read more about the legal terms of your submission here (https://auction.holly.plus/terms)\\n\\nHolly+ DAO will prioritise the most creative usage of Holly+ in considering what works to approve. Make something crazy! Please upload an audio file as a .wav and an image file as a .jpg.\\n\\nAny work submitted remains yours to do whatever you like with! You can release it on an album, to streaming, online, whatever! I really appreciate if you credit Holly+ but that is at your discretion.\\n\\nWhen submitting a work you are granting Holly+ DAO the right to mint that work as an NFT, and you will receive 50% of the profits from any sale made at auction. If your NFT is sold on the secondary market, you will receive 50% of a 10% royalty.\\n\\nHave fun y‚Äôall!\\n\\nü§ù Holly üíï\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/04836370-0b42-46c1-9b73-c3a00de7d3f1.png?height=496&width=485)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1628694323,\"title\":\"Announcing Holly+ Auction House with Zora: Submission open!!!\",\"publication\":\"holly\"},\"digest\":\"tU63ikwBg_OFPW3iMzvhkIGyi8T7pXWiFsumcfCQsXU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa62e8D6D73B44B127EFb8a094d050E7982Ef8210\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-FFihs-zQoWdkRBYgF-O4FCQtuwo_nyySDwQLccElr4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4Mb6f47uVZC1PHOELB6ytwEFFIdjP70_RbPxS4F_2BM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"Qk63xO1HjSMu0bvyx5eSpMiTP_25psFnwFu3KJ37rdreSOb1pUPlflwC0TlI2bp1JAp2WUYeir9GjMHVEO_SFA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xa2242b01de8626ddf36ac5ba46d32ae054dd2bfe4a5f4c6578115ae3c714798727ec81ad39937ce7c826a6e6148f1c8306ace170aab0c2cfc7bc5452bd7950571c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on holly.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"-FFihs-zQoWdkRBYgF-O4FCQtuwo_nyySDwQLccElr4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4Mb6f47uVZC1PHOELB6ytwEFFIdjP70_RbPxS4F_2BM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"TLQAFr7hmKYuDmo3xqL8j2UvYmyBVCsbsorLMzg8WMo\"}"
