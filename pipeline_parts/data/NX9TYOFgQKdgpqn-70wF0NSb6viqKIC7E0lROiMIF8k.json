"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"[ENS](https://ens.domains/) is decentralizing governance, and we’re [accepting applications for DAO delegates](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-delegate-applications/815).\\n\\nENS has always been an open public utility that belongs to the community. The core components of ENS are decentralized and self-running (e.g., no one can take away another person’s .ETH name), but there are a few things that require some human discretion. We believe that both ENS and the DAO space have matured enough that now is the time to pass ENS governance over to the community via the creation of a DAO and the $ENS governance token.\\n\\nSpecifically, we wish to have the ENS root multisig pass over control of the existing ENS treasury, its future funds, and control of the .ETH registrar contract that is in charge of the pricing and registration mechanism for .ETH names. The first order of business for the ENS DAO will be to formally request these from the ENS root multisig key holders.\\n\\nStarting today, people may nominate themselves as ENS governance delegates. $ENS tokens will be opened for claiming a week from today (snapshot was made yesterday), with more details about it then.\\n\\n## A Call for Delegates\\n\\nWe expect ENS governance will evolve over time. Learning from Gitcoin’s governance experience, we believe a delegate model is a good place to start. This helps the DAO represent the interests of members who can’t personally consider and vote on each proposal.\\n\\nWhile anyone will be welcome to self-delegate and vote independently, we’ll be encouraging token holders to delegate to one of the community leaders who put themselves forward.\\n\\nIn order for this to happen, we need delegates!\\n\\nWe need individuals and groups who are dedicated to the growth and longevity of ENS. If you’re interested in taking an active role in ENS governance, now’s your chance.\\n\\nIf you’re an active member of the ENS ecosystem and want to help direct the future of ENS, [follow this link and submit your application to be a delegate](https://discuss.ens.domains/t/ens-dao-delegate-applications/815).\\n\\nTime is of the essence: We plan to open the $ENS token claim process one week from today. More details about that will be available then.\\n\\nBest of luck to all delegate candidates.\\n\\nLet’s build the future of the Internet together.\",\"timestamp\":1635801223,\"title\":\"ENS DAO: Call For Delegates\",\"publication\":\"ens\"},\"digest\":\"VkHA0bPC_2pNOCjlCCgdVAcR-2EvTe_Jz-k8IiwvrzY\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x983110309620D911731Ac0932219af06091b6744\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JtTULwv22cL4r4apjD1hSwvsVJNarEvef9OGuj43ykM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"79H088tRB51XsPh0vrNJfWea8afoeV2MRhhsRF0POtM\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"i6_oyMEor8lZmksI6jL7nBtqgUbCghu1mPONwCFBIwr7lbhJRp7BkyK3rClw-c1oqdAHrT54i5-wJ-FnDt7aIA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x36ca2885b26c0b055da9e52bf91721b04873aaab6359fb1d9064696d3af3b78753e023f9c6de1c2c2b8ade345208fcbd6671b121bda5ca60d887e3163e4fc4a41c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JtTULwv22cL4r4apjD1hSwvsVJNarEvef9OGuj43ykM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"79H088tRB51XsPh0vrNJfWea8afoeV2MRhhsRF0POtM\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"cfvfKRpQSPtZJjPQOprWqEeqv2rytE7tQkxDg6ht7Oo\"}"
