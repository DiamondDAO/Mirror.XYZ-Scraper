"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Writing programs is not an easy job. It is rare for an application to be successfully built from 0 to completion without any problems, be it a write error or a program logic error. When an error occurs that causes the application not to run properly, that's when we find a bug.\\n\\nThere are several types of bugs that are often encountered, including:\\n\\n* Syntax writing error\\n* Error at runtime\\n* Logic error\\n\\n## Syntax writing error (syntax error)\\n\\nAs humans, we are certainly very with mistakes. The error that often occurs is writing the programming syntax incorrectly. Syntax is the rules of writing code that have been standardized by a particular language or framework. If we do not follow these rules, then the program we write will not run properly.\\n\\nSyntax writing errors usually occur when we forget some attributes such as quotes ( `\\\"`), semicolon ( `;`), brackets ( `[{<>}]`), or write incomplete commands. While it may seem simple at first glance, errors like this can take a while to find if you're not used to it.\\n\\n## Runtime error (runtime error)\\n\\nSyntax writing errors will usually appear immediately after the application will be executed or when it will be compiled. There are types of errors that do not appear when the application is first executed, but will appear after the program is run. This error appears when an application fails to execute something by the system while the program is running.\\n\\n## Logic error\\n\\nThis type of error is the most difficult to find because it rarely shows an error message. The consequences of logical errors are calculation errors (not always mathematical). The system cannot recognize this error because the writing has followed the correct rules but because the \\\"formula\\\" is wrong, the result is also wrong.\",\"timestamp\":1639561988,\"title\":\"Tips for Finding Bugs\"},\"digest\":\"PQaOextPKFkkKFMxtTfmSo_MiKhacvH208bFLm8xQgg\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x50b5fb9FC4a08915C772Da297Da8ECd94Fa74240\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EgB73z-EhJN1y94he0sdUmJfAE9FAxSxKlsY4r6Jmyc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tO7VIjwiEqS7GdhaNNO8xIvj_TY1WysVA4nf-eWm3RA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"_wETYlQZGZJ_r6Hv0e1E1-EGghMCkD04X74LvkBdg6KlWYh8hx5lKLiLUrUfinxNP4YvaoMLmeRbzuUrVOaGig\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc8c3cef50d797d4b33f8104f98f4578a863002f7a50b2b0fae7b85fc60dfe20c32e64be5cecfd201fa439bdaaecbcc04e3ad80c3c75f7ecea1e291fd00905e8a1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"EgB73z-EhJN1y94he0sdUmJfAE9FAxSxKlsY4r6Jmyc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"tO7VIjwiEqS7GdhaNNO8xIvj_TY1WysVA4nf-eWm3RA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"PQaOextPKFkkKFMxtTfmSo_MiKhacvH208bFLm8xQgg\"}"
