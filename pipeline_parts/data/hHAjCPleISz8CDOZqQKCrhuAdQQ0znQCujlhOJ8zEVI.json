But I feel we are in the right place at the right time.\\n\\nI made a short 3 tweet thread that gives the TL;DR of where my head is with this project atm ‚Üì\\n\\n<https://twitter.com/abstraverse/status/1479377334826409984?s=21>\\n\\nI will be publishing mirror articles on the process and roadmap progress as I wish to document this journey as we go. Much more nuance will be added along the way ü§ù\\n\\nThe short of it is this project has an opportunity to house a ‚Äònew‚Äô culture. Or a better way to articulate it is.. legitimize a culture that already exists.\\n\\nThat culture is labeled ‚Äòfine art misfits‚Äô. Its paradoxical nature is precisely why I chose it.\\n\\nHumanity has evolved beyond the societal recognition of its progress. In short, we are collectively on a lag when it comes to acting like our evolution stage. Leaving many feeling out of place.\\n\\nDigital art, crypto, NFTs, electric cars, & more are all examples of commonplace things still kept adrift from societal acceptance. I am interested in the people who feel this existence daily. I am interested in the misfits who are actually just caught up with the times.\\n\\nBringing me to the ‚Äúopportunity in the market‚Äù I mentioned last. (*see discord*)\\n\\nThe NFT projects that will not only survive, but thrive when it‚Äôs as common as having an iPhone most likely will have:\\n\\n* a specific culture of participants\\n* a native ecosystem with its own token & inclusive hierarchy\\n* a unique to its interest project (P2E, FAAS, DAO, etc)\\n\\nFor us, I feel.\\n\\n* fine art misfits\\n* paintings, primes, and $BRAND + all of its access points (streetwear, design, metaverse & IRL, etc)\\n* media project based around the abstraverse, owned and funded by the community\\n\\nThe incentive alignment opportunities for the community, creators, consumers, & culture are astounding, and this space allows for their fruition. It is something worth working toward.\\n\\nThat‚Äôs probably enough for now. Hope it was informative.\",\"timestamp\":1641549108,\"title\":\"The Hunt for Fine Art Misfits\"},\"digest\":\"iKEGVAhqHbDdCT-j-BvnxGAH9kEzNRNfejf0cJQUqSk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x869c9009A0d8279B63D83040a1aCC96a6Ad8Bf89\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nXeG_76HCHBLbFCgCi58mkreogWA3c6sRZVYiW7dnak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P5NSGyvQzfBD3zWUY_imcc2sdMegLHJS4hCl-_L2Q2Y\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4FnOGGS9YDn_r8rNDv08LvLOtB6iIhyIx114LOa-6_9DDDhV3oniW-oLUGbi-DZQLL2D_ASrhow4JYczuZjyWQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x49cb5171006778a0d2757bc1f5edb0ccb99ef757e774be6d2c9622701dc7231215a31b7504ad49baa3e45f5b3f1715da0976aab30249155fb2c174bb5bea2bbc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"nXeG_76HCHBLbFCgCi58mkreogWA3c6sRZVYiW7dnak\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P5NSGyvQzfBD3zWUY_imcc2sdMegLHJS4hCl-_L2Q2Y\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"iKEGVAhqHbDdCT-j-BvnxGAH9kEzNRNfejf0cJQUqSk\"}"
