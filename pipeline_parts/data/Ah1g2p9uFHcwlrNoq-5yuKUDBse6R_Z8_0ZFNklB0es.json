"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"(NOTE: The original version of this article entitled “Why isn’t America Educated on Ivermectin” was published, & immediately censored, on Jan 3rd, 2022 via Medium.)\\n\\nI followed all of the rules.\\n\\n\\nI masked. I distanced. I got vaccinated.\\n\\n\\nAnd yet nearly 15 months into the pandemic I got brutally sick, and at the urging of my dear friend Lee, I got tested.\\n\\n\\n“POSITIVE.”\\n\\n\\nI was momentarily shocked, but thanks to tracking months of updates & insights from Balaji Srinivasan & Peter Pham, I immediately knew my next action: get Ivermectin by any means necessary.\\n\\n Widely used in the developing world, Ivermectin, whose creation led to a Nobel prize, controversially appears to be a key in preventing the spread of Covid-19, in addition to being a safe, effective, and cheap treatment for those afflicted with the growing reach of the omicron variant and long-haul Covid.\\n\\n\\nIt’s safe: In 1981, Ivermectin went through a full FDA trial for safety and was found to have little to no side effects. Unlike newer therapies, it offers a global sample size of billions of doses over the last 40 years to determine any long-term ill effects (which are negligible).\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ffc69Tu-sNm2nTX9B2I7x.jpg?height=540&width=945)\\n\\nIt’s cheap: Ivermectin is no longer covered by its original patent, which means any qualified manufacturer can produce it, leading to a plummet in the average cost per dose (well under $1). Its economics are vastly more favorable than all Covid solutions on the market.\\n\\nIt appears to be effective: A growing list of highly credible doctors and scientists claim it’s extremely powerful in both preventing contagion as well as treating patients who have already been afflicted. It can even be used in addition to vaccines to improve efficacy. \\n\\nTwo of the few leaders willing to risk public blowback to discuss Ivermectin are evolutionary biologist Bret Weinstein and Dr. Pierre Kory, president and chief medical officer of the FLCCC (the latter of whom testified in front of the Senate in early 2021). \\n\\nBoth experts have been frustrated by the lack of media conversation, and recently have resorted to the podcast circuit to discuss their findings. \\n\\nOn a nearly three-hour podcast, they outlined the three biggest stories orbiting Ivermectin: \\n\\nDr. Kory and Mr. Weinstein also outline that if distributed properly, Ivermectin would both flatten the curve permanently and drastically change the outcomes for patients afflicted by Covid.\\n\\n*“In early \\\\[use\\\\] we see an 80% reduction of hospitalization and death*” -Dr. Pierre Kory\\n\\nIn a nearly three-hour podcast, they outlined the three biggest stories orbiting Ivermectin: <https://open.spotify.com/episode/7uVXKgE6eLJKMXkETwcw0D?si=IoTQDjgdRIGB2mNUbpsIbw&dl_branch=1>\\n\\n1. Doctors and scientists are actively being censored on YouTube and Twitter when discussing Ivermectin.\\n2. Concerns about the political risk associated with any evidence that mitigates the decision around the original emergency-use authorization of Covid vaccines means health organizations will actively discredit Ivermectin in order to protect themselves politically & legally (emergency use authorizations are only valid if there were no other safe pre-existing therapies for the respective disease).\\n3. Their creation of the FLCCC and their ensuing recommendations around Covid intervention utilizing Ivermectin to smash Covid:\\n\\nMr. Weinstein and Dr. Kory are not alone in their findings as doctors worldwide have also begun using the hashtag #WorldIvermectinDay to dispense their success stories: <https://twitter.com/search?q=%23WorldIvermectinDay&src=typeahead_click>\\n\\nIn Italy a physician has successfully treated thousands of patients at all disease stages, using ivermectin with a similar approach to the FLCCC protocol:\\n\\n<https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://ippocrateorg.org/en/2020/12/15/how-to-treat-covid-19/>\\n\\nIn India the mass distribution of Ivermectin was used successfully as both a therapy and prophylactic after they appeared to be on the edge of disaster:\\n\\n<https://twitter.com/peterpham/status/1421153845225299968?s=20>\\n\\nIn Zimbabwe doctors have curved the delta variant in the middle of winter:\\n\\nhttps://twitter.com/jjchamie/status/1419886073619099654?s=20\\n\\n*“We are lucky in Zimbabwe our ministry of health has been very supportive… If we were to stop this medication in Zimbabwe it would be an absolute disaster.”* -Dr. Jackie Stone\\n\\nIn Mexico a mass study of 200,000 patients showed powerful results:\\n\\n<https://twitter.com/peterpham/status/1416102254344507393?s=20>\\n\\nAnti-viral research published by scientists from the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, Royal Melbourne Hospital & Biomedicine Discovery Institute shared bold findings: <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354220302011>\\n\\n*“A single dose reduced the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in cells by 99.8% in 24 hours and 99.98% in 48 hours.*”\\n\\nThey go on to ask for further investigation, but their cry has fallen on deaf ears in America.\\n\\nOkay, so many these were all just tales of fantasy from a few rogue doctors… and health ministers…. and mass media publications…\\n\\nSo how about a blind placebo study? \\n\\nIt turns out Ivermectin beat the placebo in 26 out of 30 studies too.\\n\\nTo be fair, when it comes down to it I believe reasonable people can draw multiple conclusions when examining the data surrounding those studies as Scott Alexander does playing the devil’s advocate here:\\n\\n[https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted)\\n\\nBut if the data around effectiveness is at worst inconclusive for a drug that has virtually no downside wouldn’t the same “out of an abundance of caution” approach we’ve taken for nearly two years  also apply here?\\n\\nIvermectin doesn’t prevent anyone from being vaccinated, in fact it may help prevent breakthrough infections for those previously vaccinated, so what is the problem?\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest problem facing Ivermectin? It has **no profit motive** whatsoever.\\n\\nAs for my personal experience, after a single dose of Ivermectin, I went from being in the fetal position, with no ability to taste or smell to what I described as being “comfortably exhausted.”\\n\\n5-days later I tested negative with zero long-haul side effects.\\n\\nSo why does there continue to be so much misinformation surrounding Ivermectin? Remember when it was allegedly going to make us all impotent?\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal even published an op-ed questioning the lack of public support in the states for Ivermectin: <https://www.wsj.com/articles/fda-ivermectin-covid-19-coronavirus-masks-anti-science-11627482393>\\n\\n*“Why is the FDA attacking a safe, effective drug?”*\\n\\nFor all of the loud & confident voices on Twitter who gleefully slam Ivermectin & its users, I have yet to meet anyone who actually used it and didn’t share a similar experience to mine.\\n\\nIn a social media world where virtue points are awarded to detractors combined with a medical landscape dominated by financial conflicts of interest, the concern is clear: with no financial or social incentives, who will advocate for Ivermectin?\\n\\n\\\\-Darwyn\\n\\nNOTE: If you want to learn how Ivermectin fights Covid in multiple ways (including as a protease inhibitor) on a molecular level, and why it will likely be superior to Pfizer’s new clone, I recommend you start here: <https://youtu.be/ufy2AweXRkc>\\n\\n(Special thanks to Daniel Marks, Peter Pham, & Dr. Pierre Kory for their contributions to this piece).\",\"timestamp\":1641603813,\"title\":\"Why is America censoring Ivermectin?\"},\"digest\":\"UVC6u7TPLTwCtPlh3m7vR6fG5bjd9DVR0Y4HTXZnIu4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEFaFa2c48a9f3bb64FaDC1447D786c9E21963c8d\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jzgp5Hmw7N88dhPVc0AciizdQ4NTQn0AAu4M-rnMNRQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mQGV27VfhFcPf4Y2190uCYgZuyuIpeoI9cyF986sahE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ZoPbwMEFjFJTE_ydzOx-oJigBPGZ31sgPTpLg2Yph3PlhDHaJQtdAvpsWWmLZGXQutJJNLPFivOL6tpnt9NZ9g\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x58803d654fd8fb2039324b1550249f2b3776b3f370ed1333cf24a58f475c77333c9492ca079e11487b434f2dc3f88e88921f092131c4077c79b5a4d9e50398fc1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"jzgp5Hmw7N88dhPVc0AciizdQ4NTQn0AAu4M-rnMNRQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"mQGV27VfhFcPf4Y2190uCYgZuyuIpeoI9cyF986sahE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"UVC6u7TPLTwCtPlh3m7vR6fG5bjd9DVR0Y4HTXZnIu4\"}"
