"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"CPUNKS-10K are labeled subsets of the 10,000 labeled images in the [CryptoPunks collection by Larva Labs](https://www.larvalabs.com/). They have been collected for use in Machine Learning research by tnn1t1s.eth and authored by John Watkinson & Matt Hall.\\n\\n## The CPUNKS-10K dataset\\n\\nThe CPUNKS-10k dataset consists of 10000 24x24 colour images labeled with  92 classes, with a mixed number of images per class. There are 8000 training images and 2000 test images.\\n\\nThe dataset is divided into four training batches and one test batch, each with 2000 images. The test batch contains randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another.\\n\\nHere are the first five classes in the dataset, as well as 8 images from each:\\n\\n![labels with example images](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/Nmabe_TfZ-Vbcp3gm2Czy.png?height=329&width=617)\\n\\nFive classes are mutually exclusive: alien, ape, zombie, male and female. The remaining classes are not mutually exclusive. For example, there is overlap between Choker and Tiara.\\n\\n### Download\\n\\nIf you're going to use this dataset, please use the CPUNKS-10K API to mint an NFT using the [CPUNKS-10K contract](http://colorpunx.io) and reference the NFT ID in your work. This will insure the data used in your research is transparent and your work is reproducible.\\n\\nFor research in Python, it is recommended to use the [CPUNKS-10K Python API](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/\\\\~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz). For all other languages, a Comma Separated File (CSV) is provided in the [CPUNKS-10K Git Repository.](https://github.com/tnn1t1s/cpunks-10k) \\n\\n### Baseline results\\n\\nYou can find some baseline replicable results on this dataset on the [project page hosted on colorpunx.io](http://colorpunx.io/datasets/cpunks-10k). These results were obtained with a convolutional neural network. Briefly, they are 18% test error without data augmentation and 11% with regularization.\\n\\n### Dataset layout\\n\\nThe archive is distributed as a Python `pickle` file which is intended to be loaded by the CPUNKS-10K  Here is a python routine which will open the files and return training and test data sets for use in Tensorflow with Python 3.\\n\\n```\\n(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = cpunks10k.load_data()\\n```\\n\\nLoaded using the defaults, each of the batch files are grouped into a training set and paired with corresponding test data containing  with the following elements:\\n\\n* **x_train** -- an 8000x24x24x3 [numpy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) array of uint8s. Each row of the array stores a 24x24x3 colour image.\\n* **x_test** -- a 2000x24x24x3 numpy array of uint8s. Each row of the array stores a 24x24x3 colour image.\\n* **y_train** -- an 8000 row numpy array with integers in the range 0 … 92. The number at index *i* indicates the label of the *i*th image in the array **data**.\\n* **y_test** -- a 2000 row numpy array with integers in the range 0 … 92. The number at index i indicates the label of the ith image in the array data.\\n\\n  The dataset contains another file, labels.meta ,which contains a Python dictionary object with the following entries:\\n* **label_names** -- a 93-element list which gives meaningful names to the numeric labels in the **labels** array described above. For example, label_names\\\\[0\\\\] == \\\"alien\\\", label_names\\\\[1\\\\] == \\\"ape\\\", etc.\",\"timestamp\":1640740718,\"title\":\"CPUNKS-10K\"},\"digest\":\"2ynaz8wvR0enuGtClu-Nd-biOzJZYPSwdJbblkiCH00\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9C65AC91C38598D95099068C0634a5d3276de51c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uTo-zzNZiG1UU0QhECGvDLBWkwidN4TOTZkEQ8FMQrM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xvGTTHcFO5M8d8cW-bhvftuKsNDR3wb16VB4ZtBmQKo\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"D5Sjt8lprqmNIudQfmNimL2RBwbsms9qqpsQTTOQoQ8F5kLYMwu7FuNTcU3qPqkAV0KjTIbT8rShL1klbDJxWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd63a0412df04b89c4661d0e68a3b48e379b93f482d4344eff64242fe55d03ea33c8e894a5690f451a2eec40dffdbe1eda23c269d2ebc1be86d3ae94c19e740ae1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uTo-zzNZiG1UU0QhECGvDLBWkwidN4TOTZkEQ8FMQrM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"xvGTTHcFO5M8d8cW-bhvftuKsNDR3wb16VB4ZtBmQKo\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ooHeNr6MhtzEl4UE-lMqIbtMFDsdVb6pbhHhp5iJ24M\"}"
