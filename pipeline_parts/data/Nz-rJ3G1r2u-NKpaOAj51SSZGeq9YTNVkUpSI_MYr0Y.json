"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\n(1)The peopleDAO community and our Dayu community are both empowering communities for $people, and both are part of the DAO governance. I talked about 2022 being the first year of the DAO explosion, and $people is the leading of all DAOs. But the way DAO governance is an interesting topic, I want to talk about it\\n\\n(2) the essence of DAO is decentralized governance, all decisions are not made by any individual, but to be fully democracy, everyone can participate and express. Whether it is the decentralized consensus like BTC or the decentralized autonomy , it is a huge new thing. But in terms of understanding what DAO is, although there have been many articles to say, but in fact, what is scientific? My Answer is : \\\"practice makes perfect\\\".\\n\\n(3)Some people understand the decentralized autonomy of DAO as one person, one vote or one vote, one governance right, which actually all make a metaphysical mistake. For example, one person, one vote, one address, one vote, the big players just need to divide the coins into enough addresses; and one vote, one governance right, it becomes whoever has more coins is in charge - it looks fair , but the mistake  is that they forget what the purpose of decentralized autonomy is.\\n\\n(4) Decentralized autonomy, the purpose is not to decentralize, but to better governance, you can not mix the method and the goal. For example, on the PEOPLE project, from the Dyu community to PeopleDAO, and any other communities, the existence of the ultimate goal is only one - to empower PEOPLE, for the benefit of all PEOPLE holders. Any communities, any form of governance, if it deviates from this goal, it is a failure of governance.\\n\\n(5) At present, in our community, small things are discussed directly on the top pin message of the group, and opinions are widely solicited; major decisions are made in the volunteer group and development group with the deep participants of the community, and in the concept of \\\"everything that is beneficial to $people is good\\\", we discuss together, make good suggestions, and immediately put them into implementation. There are no matters that need to be voted on the chain yet - mainly because we insist that all development and actions are voluntary, no money and no coins are issued.\\n\\n(6) If we say that any future projects we do, such as developing goes very well and generate a lot of revenue, and these revenue people feel needing to set aside a part to support ecological development, then this part of the income should definitely be kept in a smart contract to keep the funds by multi-signature, and every penny on the use needs to be decided by all people holders for on-chain voting or other ways.\\n\\n(7) For those that don't involve money, anyone can do it as long as it benefits $people's development, just like you can go tweet every day, he can go make emojis, and the development team can go work on projects, all without voting. But if a vote is needed, how should the decision be made? Going back to the topic at the beginning, whether the votes speak for themselves or are supplemented by a Twitter referendum or something like that, these are things that we and other DAOs need to keep refining.\\n\\n(8) When you think about it, the practice of DAO is of great significance. The scale of blockchain in the future will be tens or hundreds of times larger than it is now, and will certainly change the world as big as the Internet and affect people's life. The DAO will be the most important part of it, how to scientifically decentralize autonomy?\\n\\n\\n(9) $people started from the auction, from the ideal, and pursuit of democracy, freedom, highlighting the individuals.People are conveying the goodness in their hearts, this wonderful story is destined to be much higher than any other MEMEs, and the concept of \\\"everyone is a participant, is a builder, and is a winner\\\" proposed by our community is also inspired by the classic quote said above from our community is inspired by the classic quote \\\"of the people, by the peopel, for the people\\\", and the ideal that we have been searching for will come true.\\n\\n(10) Our community is perhaps the first community in the blockchain industry to put forward the concept of \\\"common building and sharing\\\", openly declaring the obligation to contribute  without seeking private benefits, uniting a large group of developers and propagandists with ideas and abilities to participate in the construction of the people ecology.\\n\\n(11) We hope to free more and more people from the zero-sum game, and to participate in win-win game, to create a harmonious and mutually supportive community that grows together, so that each community member can improve in mind and gain in investment - so that the dissemination of the $people concept is organically integrated into the whole process of community building. This interesting practice is waiting for you to join.\",\"timestamp\":1640645261,\"title\":\"DAO & PEOPLE\"},\"digest\":\"1Gdx7CAffYi4L5tx5Ni1TiND3n2gG_9hpesb0V64cO8\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x7A470d8014a122245b0410774618B7ED0E990Daa\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KFiv7VbW4jKd70Al3pQ9Gdwb41Q2arb5k9shq9CWalk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Lt_la7BuHAINew9KM-AjWTLTC4t9foIsHAtURoznOQk\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"6JdkMVKPUWR7s0WuBBPVAl5XSeM7qv3g8eQHpFagvdBiQDiJ6bBhSB8zqrq8r6cIjz1WmSVVL2lc9oKmyjhjsQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xf879eaef733ebee9d558de3a1d20849f325ee4a816f2e8a1411842407de24268791eccd9b5d009ce4a35e3664594a8ae19d04b4be5f8c520d082f6c05a22c3141c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"KFiv7VbW4jKd70Al3pQ9Gdwb41Q2arb5k9shq9CWalk\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"Lt_la7BuHAINew9KM-AjWTLTC4t9foIsHAtURoznOQk\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1Gdx7CAffYi4L5tx5Ni1TiND3n2gG_9hpesb0V64cO8\"}"
