This NFT is for all of you who have a Generativemasks! To talk more about this, please take a look at the cautions and details listed down below and we're gonna explain how to mint on this page!\\n\\n### **By the way, we name this NFT \\\"Generativemasks Girl\\\"!**\\n\\n## The motivation\\n\\nBefore we go into the details and stuff, we really want you to know why we decided to do this. So please let take a bit of time and share the background and motivation towards this. One of the core feelings that we have is that we want more people to know about \\\"Creative Coding\\\", and we want them to find Generative Art interesting and have fun with it.\\n\\nSo with that being said, it is meaningful for us to give you this raf's derivative work as an NFT and to keep running derivative art contests. This is because we feel that we really want Generativemasks to be more than just a work of art.  We want it to be a playground for many creative coders and creators to enjoy together.\\n\\nIn this sense, all the code of Generativemasks is open to the public, and that's why we have chosen a license that allows people to use it for non-commercial purposes.\\n\\nWe hope that we grow together with you as a unique NFT project in the world.\\n\\n## The Beauty of \\\"Generativemasks Girl\\\"\\n\\nFirst of all, please take a close look at the design of the girl's hair and see if you can find the Generativemasks there. And as you can see, the very fresh look of the girl, the Generativemasks design and the beautiful background color make it look stunning. The design pattern and color change every time you reload the page, just like the Generativemasks. And in addition to that, as shown in the video down below, if you move the mouse cursor while dragging, you'll be able to see how the layer structure of the work looks like. We believe that it's something you can find interesting and enjoy!\\n\\nSo, we definitely think that we want you to get your own Generativemasks Girl NFT! And if you could set the image of the NFT as your Twitter profile, that would be amazing!\\n\\nLet's have fun and enjoy the culture of derivative art together!\\n\\n[https://youtu.be/-a25B8i3qiQ](https://youtu.be/-a25B8i3qiQ)\\n\\n# How to mint?\\n\\n### About Generativemasks Girl\\n\\n* Generativemasks Girl is a new 10,000 piece of NFT created by [raf](https://twitter.com/raf___gallery) who is the winner of the Generativemasks derivative art contest.\\n* Generativemasks Girl can be claimed for each NFT of the Generativemasks.
