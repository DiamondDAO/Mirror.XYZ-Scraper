"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"It is hard to sum up the automobile industry of 2019 in a simple sentence, especially in the Chinese market.\\n\\nAt the same time of pessimism, car companies are trying to find a breakthrough to ensure that they do not fall behind. However, in some aspects, the Chinese automobile market has also made some remarkable achievements. China is still the largest market for new energy vehicles. In terms of the \\\"new four modernizations\\\"( motor-driven, smart, networking and sharing ) of vehicles, the intelligent Internet connection is also in rapid development and change. Many enterprises have begun to seize the market of intelligent vehicles.\\n\\nNo matter new energy vehicles or intelligent Internet connected vehicles, they are still in the early stage of rapid development. If they are calculated in years, they changes a lot every year. Just like the changes in 2017 ⇌ 2019, which flooded on WeChat Moments a while ago, GeekPark (ID: geekpark) tries to compare several groups of figures in 2018 and 2019, so as to make a simple review of the past year.\\n\\nWhile remaining optimistic, we continue to look for a bright future. We hope that the following figures can reflect the truth of the industry.\\n\\n984000 → 1024000\\n\\nIn 2018 and 2019, China's pure electric vehicle sales volume (the following years are both 2018 and 2019, which are omitted).\\n\\n2019 doesn't make the whole car market better. Even the new energy vehicles that people had hoped for were in a state of stagnation or even retrogression.\\n\\nJust in 2019, many automobile brands released pure electric vehicle models one after another, it is easy to believe the potential of the model in the future. From the perspective of pure sales data, it may be the only one of several major models that is still growing.\\n\\nAccording to the data of China Automobile Association, the sales volume of pure electric vehicles in 2018 was 984,000, an increase of 50.8% year on year. Since the data of 2019 has not been released, from the sales data of January to November, the sales volume of pure electric vehicles is 832,000. Assuming that the sales volume in December 2019 and December 2018 are equal, that is 192000, the sales volume of pure electric vehicles in 2019 is roughly the same as that in the previous year, with a slight increase. (Note: 1,024,000 is estimated data)\\n\\nIn terms of growth rate, even if the sales volume exceeds that of 2018, the growth rate drops sharply. This is also the result caused by many factors.\\n\\n500km→600km\\n\\nThe highest range of pure electric vehicles in China.\\n\\nAmong China's pure electric vehicles on the market in 2018, it seems that we can hardly see the number of endurance mileage of more than 500, most of which hover between 400-450km. BYD Qin Pro EV600 may be the rare NEDC model with a range of more than 500km at that time. In 2019, the endurance mileage of pure electric vehicles has increased significantly, from an average of 400km to an average of 500km. The endurance mileage of GAC Aion LX has even exceeded 600km, reaching a higher range.\\n\\nFrom the current published models, such as NIO EC6, XPeng P7 and other models, it can be predicted that the new vehicle's endurance will be upgraded to within 600km in 2020. Among the limited battery technologies, vehicle enterprises and suppliers are still seeking a little bit opportunities to break through.\\n\\n24613 → 57432\\n\\nSales volume of new making-car forces.\\n\\nWith a gamble between He Xiaopeng and Li Bin, the new making-car forces came to an end in the discussion of 10000 sets in 2018. But at that time, no one thought that 2019 was such a tough time.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of total sales volume, the data is bound to rise significantly. According to incomplete statistics of GeekPark (ID: geekpark), in 2018, the sales volume of the whole new making-car forces was 24613, of which nearly half was contributed by NIO with 11348. According to the current published sales volume from January to November 2019, the combined sales volume of several new making-car forces is 57432 (also incomplete statistics).\\n\\nHowever, it is worth noting that, compared with 2018, except for the enterprises that started to sell on a large scale in 2019, other new making-car forces did not have the \\\"boom\\\" as we expected. NIO, who continues to maintain its head position, has only achieved 43.5% of the sales target, not even half of it. Some enterprises, which achieved a lot of sales through small or micro electric vehicles in 2018, encountered a sales crisis in 2019, with sales plummeting. Sitech, whose sales target was 40000 units in 2019, only delivered 962 units in the first 10 months.\\n\\nThere are too many factors that lead to low sales volume, such as products, funds, marketing, ect. As we can see, the new making-car forces have not soared as the optimists imagined, nor have slumped. Following the law of the auto industry is the only thing they can do now. (Note: 57432 is the sales volume figure from January to November 2019.)\\n\\n0 → 15\\n\\nDeliveries of Chinese Tesla.\\n\\nBefore 2020, Chinese Tesla finally started \\\"delivery\\\" - not for the public, but for internal employees. Tesla's indissoluble relationship with the Chinese market is also officially launched.\\n\\nThe delivery volume is indeed very promising, but behind the 15 Chinese Tesla, the Chinese speed is amazing. In 2018, Chinese Tesla is just a promise, the factory is still a wasteland. In only 358 days, Tesla is ready to start large-scale delivery in China, which is hard to imagine even on a global scale.\\n\\nNot only did it beat 99% of \\\"global netizens\\\" in terms of speed, but Chinese Tesla also set a precedent in China's auto industry - foreign-owned enterprises produce cars in China. In addition, it has to compete with new making-car forces, independent brands and pure electric vehicles under joint venture brands in China. Therefore, Tesla’s arrival is also the re-education of China's automobile market.\\n\\n135700 → 33281\\n\\nNumber of new energy vehicle recalls in China.\\n\\nIn 2019, several spontaneous combustion events of new energy vehicles have attracted the attention of the whole society. People cannot help worrying about the safety of power battery, which is the most important part of new energy vehicles.\\n\\nBut it must be noted that these spontaneous combustion events are indeed a case, and there are fewer and fewer similar events. According to the recall announcement issued by the State Administration of market supervision and administration, as of the end of December, there were 33281 recalled new energy vehicles which have been required. There were 9 vehicle enterprises including Tesla, BAIC new energy, NIO and BMW (China). In 2018, a total of 135700 new energy vehicles were recalled, accounting for 13.46%.\\n\\nIn 2019, 6217 new energy vehicles were recalled due to power battery problems, accounting for 18.68% of the t4803 ES8otal recall. On June 27, due to the hidden danger of battery pack, NIO announced that 4803 ES8 were recalled, which also led to a series of negative effects such as the loss of revenue and the sharp drop of stock price.\\nOn the whole, a significant reduction in the number of recalls means that the safety of vehicles is constantly improving, especially new energy vehicles, a new product that the customers do not know much about. So the data is very persuasive.\\n\\n89 → 69\\n\\nNumber of the automotive battery enterprises with installed data.\\n\\nIf we only use this data to calculate, 20 companies have quit the field of new energy vehicles in a year, or even shut down companies. In 2016, there were 155 automotive battery enterprises in China, the highest number in recent years. For the automotive battery enterprises, the new energy vehicle market is closely linked with their fate.\\n\\nIt is precisely because of the market, with the development of China's new energy vehicles, the automotive battery is more inclined to CATL, BYD and other top enterprises. While the small and less resourced companies have a very tough time. OptimumNano, the first enterprise to realize the scale of new energy vehicle automotive battery and once become the fifth largest installed capacity of new energy vehicles in China, declared bankruptcy just before the bell of 2020 new year. Maybe the division line of automotive battery enterprises towards the era of oligarchy will be drawn from then on.\\n\\n30TOPS→200TOPS\\n\\nOnboard car chip computing power.\\n\\nThis data is not about China, but the competition between several top enterprises in the world. In 2019, chip manufacturers have become obsessed with computing power.\\n\\nNIO ES8 officially began to be sold in 2018, and it is also the first mass production vehicle equipped with Mobileye EyeQ4 chip. Mobileye EyeQ4 has low computing power. On the one hand, it is mainly for ADAS scenarios which does not need high computing power; on the other hand, it has relatively low power consumption and some limitations on the breakthrough of computing power. NVIDIA also announced that its car chip Xavier began mass production, with a computing power of 30TOPS at the end of 2018.\\n\\nThere are always competitors, this time it's a new player. Tesla released a FSD chip for its Autopilot in April 2019, with a total power of 72TOPS (each set of hardware includes two chips, with a total power of 144TOPS). And it overwhelmed Xavier. Moreover, after the release of the chip, the chip was rapidly mass-produced and loaded on the vehicle. In theory, the FSD chip has the highest computing power this year.\\n\\nIn recent GTC2019, NVIDIA has launched a new \\\"nuclear bomb\\\", the new automatic driving system chip Orin, whose single chip computing power up to 200TOPS. It becomes the chip King. In the continuous computing power competition, a higher level of automatic driving is also being prepared, and a complete ecosystem is about to emerge.\\n\\n0→1\\n\\nIn the international market, 2019 is regarded as a start for many car companies.\\n\\nFor the first time, the foundation of the automobile industry began to shake. For the traditional car enterprises, how to transform has become a top priority. Although new energy only accounts for a small proportion in the automobile industry, its potential is great and nobody dares to ignore it. So, after a period of wait-and-see and R& D, the first electric vehicle of traditional car companies came.\\n\\nIf Audi e-tron and Jaguar I-pace are the first to take the initiative, then in 2019, whether new models which have been unveiled or released, traditional car companies have started the pure electric journey. Ford Mustang Mach-E, Porsche Taycan and Mercedes-Benz EQC are all new entrants. And Volkswagen ID.3, Ford electric pickup F150, etc., will be available soon. It is enough to show the determination of car companies to build a zero-carbon society and turn to pure electric technology. What is more to be expected is that the above models have already or will soon open up a new market in China. When they are absorbed by the Chinese market, they will be different landscapes.\\n\\nFrom 0 to 1, it is also the line that pure electric vehicles hope to break through. In 2019, the growth, stagnation and retrogression of the automobile market have been fully presented. We believe that the success or failure experience and thinking will finally turn into a cornerstone of industry progress.\\n\\nThis is an article from GeekPark, translated by Chris Yuan.\",\"timestamp\":1641523906,\"title\":\"Tesla, Nio, Xpeng...The overall growth of China’s new energy vehicles industry slows down in 2019\"},\"digest\":\"KgwO0ctU1rc58ZmIhveKhB5mlQBL3cYKxEk2x9ZqnL4\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x021D29dC0d2DfC3137253fCb9fE56c6BD1d8a225\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JYZDbC55KuWwe2OC6cJhOu8Ak4BlV06YqJ3cLf4IXA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EISdO5a5-8cZsq1MjXo7j4mPetZnqTIVk8VXgO6YY2w\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"1KbdiN_dkbVyX-WenXVH3ptphzgb_G66Okl3JijgdLowTHGjkvLc1EQXBMbimy3hVrdMAe7qAiLV6D3MUJUGQQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a5e280c109f2e0b82e94a5ebd8036a14a846924a0ed240d64d91c5724ca6e080811f2c079b4bc53a0fdad0c4e0905ac6a7dbad2e4da00a9f4619a04abb15f4b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"JYZDbC55KuWwe2OC6cJhOu8Ak4BlV06YqJ3cLf4IXA8\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"EISdO5a5-8cZsq1MjXo7j4mPetZnqTIVk8VXgO6YY2w\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"KgwO0ctU1rc58ZmIhveKhB5mlQBL3cYKxEk2x9ZqnL4\"}"
