And although I had minted these works at the end of 2020 to early 2021, with Mirror's splits, and the open-source auction method $BOUNTY, I was able to not only bring these works back into the fore; I could do so with the proper attribution attached in an effort to give back to those who took part, supported my experiment, and of course on-ramp my friends into Crypto.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 1 DJ Set, 1 Voice Note, 1 Essay.\\n\\nToday, May 19th, 2021 the auctions for SYNESTHESIA, Chinese Omelette OST, and In Vitro Nostalgia will be available for auction on Zora and Mirror.\\n\\nSYNESTHESIA has a reserve price of 1.5 ETH.\\nChinese Omelette OST has a direct sale price of 5 ETH, at auction the reserve price will be 2 ETH.\\nIn Vitro Nostalgia has a reserve price of 0.1 ETH.\\n\\n\\n### SYNESTHESIA\\n[NFT](ethereum://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7/1643)\\n\\n### Chinese Omelette OST\\n\\n[Token #188](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=188)\\n\\n### In Vitro Nostalgia\\n\\n[Token #3158](auction://0xabEFBc9fD2F806065b4f3C237d4b59D9A97Bcac7?network=mainnet&tokenId=3158)\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Owning The NFMTs\\nFor any owner of the NFMTs, here are a set of perks you get associated with the works. You don't have to purchase the set although it is highly encouraged!\\n\\n* Become a proud owner of a body of work that honors attribution, patronage, and experimentation of a new medium in cryptomedia.\\n\\n* A massive signal that onboarding your peers into crypto can stem from giving back in a meaningful, permanent way. \\n\\n* Showing a tangible symbol of support to cultural creatives.\\n\\n* Owning a special edition hardcover version of the physical book of my Artist-in-residence experience in Japan. [View \\\"ARTEFACT[S]\\\"](https://sirsugoods.com/Artefact-s-Making-New-From-That-Which-Is-Foreign)\\n\\n* A zoom or IRL (depending on where you live) meeting discussing the creation of the NFTs, their underlying experiences, other sources of inspiration, and future expansion of the NFMT (non-fungible memory token) concept.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Splits\\n\\nThe splits breakdown will derive from the sale of the \\\"In Vitro Nostalgia\\\" essay, the Chinese Omelette OST, and SYNESTHESIA. Because SYNESTHESIA is auctioned through Zora's deployment of $BOUNTY and not on Mirror, 30% of those funds will be added as a tip to the two split contracts attached to this essay.\\n\\n### Splits Breakdown\\n\\nTo emphasize proper attribution, I wanted to deploy one split contract with recipients that influenced the Secret Party Trilogy, SYNESTHESIA respectively. At the end of the auction period, the ETH within these splits will be claimable to the recipients below. \\n\\n**Split Recipients of Secret Party Trilogy (Chinese Omelette OST Auction):**\\n*Fusion Art Japan Residency (30%)*\\n[Starnilas Oge](https://twitter.com/SCOGE2222)\\n\\n[SECRET PARTY SPLIT](split://0xAdc5e09f4494385758bF33237da20fa58bfAa820?network=mainnet)\\n\\n\\n**Split Recipients of SYNESTHESIA (Zora Auction) + Essay NFT Auction:**\\n\\n*SCAD Roomies (30%)*\\n[W.T.

The VS collective stems from the roots of Zaakir's devotion to sonic creativity and innovation within the entertainment business. \\n\\nCurrently, music doesn't have the fanfare and hold like visual art. With MintMusic + Voyager Sound, we have an opportunity to fund musicians at scale. \\n\\nMore on this later.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1621418075,\"title\":\"Memory Tokens: The Auction\",\"publication\":\"sirsu\"},\"digest\":\"zBfdCdhgZzBoel9qBtNRnPrcZntGATzKCRwKCg2p0BI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xEB95ff72EAb9e8D8fdb545FE15587AcCF410b42E\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UCaADZyqyJ8_PGekrdtpblM9Z5LOI1YS3h0uO717pgM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vgpeMt9vdrAMghfVLfguLoRc4FevN7FCYLa0EAHV2ao\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"SFJyrcxxt42svVymoQyNDnACtXQf2jgo7-BK4TK8OHRFXDyHAuwccHCDGC1JX73-bqhdIDKEUauL4cJMzLSpAg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc9fbcdd8d9ae02a683c0b0ec2999cdc6464866ee091af668f007ca510c982c68675fdb272bbe2f7784153053fff7f7e93a557c51e884236ba5be675e2f74da9b1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on sirsu.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"UCaADZyqyJ8_PGekrdtpblM9Z5LOI1YS3h0uO717pgM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"vgpeMt9vdrAMghfVLfguLoRc4FevN7FCYLa0EAHV2ao\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"OcOBV-6MQBpogwpDKwVB-DMSvHNqvPptqdHQB_7Wc2s\"}"
