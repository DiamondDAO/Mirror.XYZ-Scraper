Coinshift, formerly MultiSafe, is a leader in becoming the “Intuit of DAOs”, offering a full suite of financial tools for what DAOs need to run their operations: treasury management, cash-flow, financing, payments/payroll, and risk management + insurance. DAOs are likely going to grow 100x in scale, number, and impact (the FAANGs of Web3), and all have very different needs depending on their size, goals, funding, and governance. So the software services that power them is a small market today with massive growth potential.\\n\\n[https://decrypt.co/82233/visa-universal-payment-channel-stablecoin-cbdc](https://decrypt.co/82233/visa-universal-payment-channel-stablecoin-cbdc)\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/connextnetwork/status/1442846763841425410?s=12](https://twitter.com/connextnetwork/status/1442846763841425410?s=12)\\n\\n**🤔   Why it Matters**\\n\\n> Ethereum mainnet experimented and found product-market fit for permissionless blockchains, but we’re rapidly moving towards a multichain world to keep up with the growth phases DeFi and NFTs. Visa, one of the main beneficiaries of closed TradFi payments networks, announced an L2 network continuing the trend of fintech+DeFi converging in the coming years ([Societe Generale+Maker](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/30/societe-generale-applies-for-20m-makerdao-loan-using-bond-token-collateral/) being another example). There seems to be further growing consensus that DeFi represents a 10x improvement over legacy system in terms of efficiency, transparency, and settlement time. Relatedly, Connext’s launch signals the importance of liquid, fantastic UX bridges across all these different chains that will eventually power our total financial lives.\\n\\n[https://blog.coinbase.com/now-get-your-paycheck-deposited-into-coinbase-116fe1d073ce](https://blog.coinbase.com/now-get-your-paycheck-deposited-into-coinbase-116fe1d073ce)\\n\\n**🤔   Why it Matters**\\n\\n> Direct deposit is every fintech PM’s wet dream. 🤭  It’s the feature that’s going to drive your growth KPIs for quarters to come! Coinbase wants you to trade, earn, and pay through its service as easy as possible and crypto onramps are a notorious bottleneck. Direct deposit solves this to some extent. The more interesting trend is thinking about crypto portfolio allocation in terms of your paycheck. Many people want to take 10%…20%…50% of their paycheck in crypto and that market is growing fast…at least until the next bear market. I’d expect every crypto pseudo-bank to add direct deposit with time.\",\"timestamp\":1633113575,\"title\":\"Top Crypto Product Launches: Oct 1\",\"publication\":\"launch\"},\"digest\":\"viOyXiwSrhpf6pT6ax8gFbMIS8JntYEv3nKUiJF-Bxc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x869eC00FA1DC112917c781942Cc01c68521c415e\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kBpdu0ilThcGIlxgaiXL4jMZAA8pkWiBvZ_38GEtmvc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cqs8t4tVsdDnkZNWklt8IrcGZa8I-AMuFivZGgipLdE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IbWo-NiPlqX8ksh3mmw6QKNyMC6ZnZtOwcIGqq5N-j0493sTGIsHnpGHv2cWP74Urh1k5QdnFA-GmDK1w1wujQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x90adff2d27cf4f2de16beddd107f419d64992d3bb2b1a11d3decf03dd7db9c8c50da39166d98d7bdb25d1b28ab44bf0c97e3f3d7ed9b9348935820b413ce08c11b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize the publication of articles on launch.mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"kBpdu0ilThcGIlxgaiXL4jMZAA8pkWiBvZ_38GEtmvc\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"cqs8t4tVsdDnkZNWklt8IrcGZa8I-AMuFivZGgipLdE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"viOyXiwSrhpf6pT6ax8gFbMIS8JntYEv3nKUiJF-Bxc\"}"
