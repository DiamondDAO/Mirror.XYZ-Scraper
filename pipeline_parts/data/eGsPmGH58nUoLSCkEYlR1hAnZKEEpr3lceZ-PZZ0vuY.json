"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Do you like racing? Are you a Formula 1 fan? You’ve come to the right place. \\n\\nFor the last 71 years, auto enthusiasts around the world have tuned in to watch the greatest drivers compete at the highest level. In fact, total viewership for the 2021 season stands at 471M people! \\n\\nF1, much like the crypto community, is truly global, with more viewers per race than nearly any other sport. Legends from Brazil (Senna), Spain (Alonso), Germany (Shumacher), the UK, and countless more nations risk their lives to prove their worth.\\n\\nBut they don’t do it alone. Each team may only have two drivers, but the organizations that support them include hundreds of unsung heroes – mechanics, engineers, pit crew, owners and maybe someday, even you.\\n\\nF1 currently has 10 active teams and under new rules implemented in 2021, there are two open spots for new teams in the future.\\n\\nOver the next several months, Formula 1 DAO seeks to become a permanent fixture in the sport with the following roadmap:\\n\\nFeb 2022 - We will drop the Formula 1 DAO Membership NFT that will grant you exclusive rights to events and parties we host at F1 race events. The first event will be held in Formula 1 Miami May 2022. \\n\\nMid 2022 - The Formula 1 DAO will reach out and start initial negotiations to purchase a stake in F1 teams up for sale (including Alfa Romeo & Haas). As we finalize these negotiations, Formula 1 DAO will raise new funds and launch a governance token $FORMULA that will be given to everyone who participates in the raise.\\n\\nLate 2022 - We hope to finalize negotiations and complete the takeover or large minority investment in one of the current F1 teams\\n\\n2023 and Beyond - Formula 1 DAO will expand and host events at every F1 event with exclusive events, parties, and swag for NFT holders and investors in $FORMULA. \\n\\n It isn’t going to be easy, and we still have a lot to figure out, but together, we can achieve something great.\\n\\n Let’s buy a Formula 1 team!\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nWhat’s an NFT?\\n\\nWhy do you need a governance token $FORMULA?\\n\\nWhy are you launching both an NFT and a governance token?\\n\\nIs this legal or is there precedent for this? \\n\\nHow do we know this is not a rug?\",\"timestamp\":1641310339,\"title\":\"F1 DAO Roadmap\"},\"digest\":\"qD7nhUQ2VBYIvHlwahBLiObuYHuCx15rXF-ecSQ9gjk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x72C963b0B36cCf37E0B10D0126B8DEf9E8897853\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Hvmr7SNe2AvG_C-9VFwC2AG6nYTcQPAUCHDCBGM_U7g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-EAkVD-5ziOvnmkS2WsuJpGj1wM5Zw3-Nn8ufE3bcJ4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hRaTidw9dp8Nkqk4E9ZVbHdkT3uIAas_SKQpB6OwJ4su4aD3Q4rJINmYxVAXo1SjjkaJOJKla7zhgdRcdvGR2A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xeb757829a88677cb8435129bdff25f5e119f3b24975e09f818a5df82cc106e41357f49c33706a64638b18489dc0c2c33f6f947f1fd1a15c16a68be667a250ab71b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"Hvmr7SNe2AvG_C-9VFwC2AG6nYTcQPAUCHDCBGM_U7g\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"-EAkVD-5ziOvnmkS2WsuJpGj1wM5Zw3-Nn8ufE3bcJ4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"qD7nhUQ2VBYIvHlwahBLiObuYHuCx15rXF-ecSQ9gjk\"}"
