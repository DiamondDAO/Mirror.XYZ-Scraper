"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"The Peninsular War of 1807-1814, the War of 1812 and the Waterloo campaign of 1815 had a bad effect on the people of Great Britain, either socially, economically or psychologically. Banks were bankrupt, the American market was closed, unemployment had reached great proportions. One of the biggest reasons for unemployment to reach great levels was the emergence of factories and the influx of agricultural workers from rural lands to cities and factories.\\n\\nAfter John Kay invented the flying shuttle in 1733, the textile industry moved from homes to factories. A new class, the working class, emerged as a result of what we call the \\\"industrial revolution\\\" today, that is, the social, economic and psychological effects of successive technological inventions. The drastic change of lifestyle and the relocation of work from home to factory raised concerns that Kay's shuttle would leave many more unemployed. In 1753, Kay's house was looted by weavers, and Kay was forced to flee. The greatest mass migration from homes to factories occurred in the 19th century, with the widespread use of technological inventions. At that time, textile manufacturers, who felt the economic pressures of the Napoleonic wars and spent years to learn and master their craft, were disturbed by the fact that their jobs were taken from manpower by factories and given to mechanical forces, and they started a rebellion. The workers who broke into the weaver's factories and smashed the machines referred to themselves as \\\"Luddites\\\". The workers' revolt against machine-breaking has grown so much that the government has said it will punish machine-breaking with death. It is emphasized that the government mobilized an army of 12,000 men to suppress the Luddite revolts.\\n\\n*“.. The 12,000-man army needed to suppress the Luddites was a larger force than Wellington had taken to Portugal in 1808... The army against the Luddites was six times as large as had previously been needed for internal disputes. .. Luddism was something new... There had been civil wars, religious revolts, food riots, and industrial revolts in the previous two centuries, but never in the context of an industrial revolution such large-scale industrial revolts occurred simultaneously with food riots. And all of this was happening during the country's biggest war ever, with an economy dependent on currently unsustainable overseas trade.”*\\n\\nWith the participation of the army in 1812, the Luddites revolt was bloodily suppressed. Many of the workers were killed. Today, only the word *\\\"technophobia\\\"* remains from the Ludites.\\n\\nLuddites were struggling with such an old problem that Zoroastrians fought against Muslims, Muslims against Christians, Christians against Capitalism, and Capitalism against the Internet for the same reason. Now, something we cannot foresee, define, or do not know yet, perhaps an impulse stemming from the need for freedom, warns us that we should keep our distance from innovation. Just like the Luddites were warned.\\n\\nIt wasn't the technology itself that scared Luddites at the time, it was its implications. Technology that created cultural, economic and social transformation was a meaningless, inequality and terrible transformation project in their eyes. Can we say the same for today's NFTs?\\n\\nThe Internet, the cultural, social and economic revolution that followed, the children of the Internet, the desire of the children of the Internet to be liberated and \\\"healed\\\", decentralization, NFTs and a new *\\\"environment\\\"*. There will be those who support it, and there will be those who are against it. But it is a fact that the internet has created its own revolution. Just like in the technological revolution, in the internet revolution, this process takes society from one level to another.\\n\\nNFT has different meanings for today and tomorrow. But I think it was NFT, not cryptocurrencies, that changed the nature of money (it's an open war against the god of capitalist religion).\\n\\n*“The emergence of capitalism paved the way for a religion that was not based on any faith, doctrine or theology. While arguing that capitalism should be seen as a religion, Walter Benjamin stressed that it contains some awe-inspiring gods. For example, \\\"comparison of pictures of saints of different religions with banknotes of different states\\\" is an example. Money in the form of paper notes now became an example of a cult similar to saints in \\\"ordinary\\\" religions. According to Benjamin, money, wealth and commodities are some of the gods of the capitalist religion.”*\\n\\nNFT has completely shaken the meaning of all these gods. The NFT community broke the doors of the capitalism mint building and took all the money. Moreover, NFT did it in a very entertaining way. Only a relatively aesthetic \\\"thing\\\" remained.\\n\\nBut one question still remains a mystery; Instead of destroying the gods of the capitalist religion, the NFT turned into them?\\n\\nWe don't know for now.\\n\\nBut those who still have faith want a rematch for this cynical victory. But there is no rematch. There is a transition in the middle. Whether this transition, which has changed our perception of the Internet, is easy or difficult and \\\"bloody\\\", the transition is already taking place. It will continue to happen.\\n\\nWhen the government loses its power, the opposition only becomes a tool that feeds it. Until the power is overthrown. The \\\"money\\\" of the present has been overthrown.\\n\\nYesterday's Luddites could be today's innovation skeptics. Today's inventors can be tomorrow's pirates. \\n\\nWe're here, we'll see.\\n\\n** \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n **\",\"timestamp\":1638836436,\"title\":\"Gods of capitalist religion vs NFT.\"},\"digest\":\"EIBdTt3HJf7GMg3jYzf50tQlXf4FxDgXw8BGSr2cnT0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x862f164347e13c0AAD3649dc3b1104f0f12b2856\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VfhyP8m6uHbBZ-hu-HiXQqjpMZWMCWfl116ouJ-jFv4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"s-XRZ1h01mvH1aI9rNfd5-6ObXVn3ODktdIiDqVcFPU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kV20B487iDYLhOpLS6qtD_nq_q29cZY2I2UeN62R7DhDu4dojLR7SBl5RZdOnm4yO8tylUj0Q2vNxuXMvyuHOw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9f17c824e86fd7f1bbbc4db02247166ba5145f8f9a8012434dd6387a544991682b1583664aac0a95dec6fccd79624bd3db2e978dc56ae59f23ced8778134ebb61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"VfhyP8m6uHbBZ-hu-HiXQqjpMZWMCWfl116ouJ-jFv4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"s-XRZ1h01mvH1aI9rNfd5-6ObXVn3ODktdIiDqVcFPU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"EIBdTt3HJf7GMg3jYzf50tQlXf4FxDgXw8BGSr2cnT0\"}"
