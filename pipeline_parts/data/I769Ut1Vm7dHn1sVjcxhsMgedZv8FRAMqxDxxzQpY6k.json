"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Angel Protocol utilizes the power of Terra decentralized financial applications to create perpetual charity endowments. These endowments allow donations to compound over time, creating an indefinitely growing source of revenue for charity organizations. By creating a foundational source of income that grows over time, Angel Protocol seeks to empower charities with a pathway to financial freedom.\\n\\nIn addition to fulfilling a beneficent worldwide use case, Angel Protocol supports the growth of the Terra Ecosystem as a whole. By locking up endowments indefinitely, Angel Protocol effectively raises the floor UST TVL, reducing the amount of UST in circulating supply. As all Lunatics now, increasing the market cap of UST is the main way to raise the price of LUNA.\\n\\n## Angel Protocol Reinvents Charitable\\n\\nAngel Protocol begins with charity. Any charitable organization can apply to create its own endowment fund at no cost. The only requirement is a Terra wallet. If a charitable organization is uncomfortable with Terra, they are also able to create a wallet through a custodian such as [Fireblocks](https://www.fireblocks.com/customers/custodian-banks/), or by using the direct implementation of Angel on [Kado](https://kado.money/).\\n\\nOnce a charitable organization is hosted on Angel Protocol, it can begin to receive endowments. Endowments are much more valuable than one-off donations – they are designed to invest contributions into perpetually compounding funds that use Terra decentralized financial applications – namely [Anchor Earn](https://docs.anchorprotocol.com/user-guide/webapp/earn). This allows most of the principal to remain intact while utilizing yield as revenue for charitable efforts. Watch what happens when a $100 endowment is made using Angel:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zDuYooMISdwpeQlJwTPF9.png?height=309&width=726)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1638351485,\"title\":\"Angel Protocol: Building a Better Tomorrow\"},\"digest\":\"CmLxsJo_EDAQ3o3AAyINX6t2VAUk7QcbfCj_WOzIHbI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x061dc3EEAb67dbe0835BFC4D45135a967b9B20d1\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RoSIrLuYPRmdm6MlnWysQsoFaluOj6_sy7a_vGSoiD4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qtaB6dbTbF6L4Jlb6NBKq94QMtCpltGkzA3pu3o87ro\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"nnGMe1hT-s38mAQKADOCRYSB9Smvi5UnTW5SIQQA3lhWsFg8zvCoEUPaDh8LE4R_geuG77jA8H-D2dF3mgS_Cg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x62c4fef13719111f45fda7201f5138f8f2a09d7a93cda647eef400307f5fb60d3c328690f903cbfb9f19e0c3a79f3147593984f3b41dc080122929539c0fd9ec1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RoSIrLuYPRmdm6MlnWysQsoFaluOj6_sy7a_vGSoiD4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"qtaB6dbTbF6L4Jlb6NBKq94QMtCpltGkzA3pu3o87ro\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"CmLxsJo_EDAQ3o3AAyINX6t2VAUk7QcbfCj_WOzIHbI\"}"
