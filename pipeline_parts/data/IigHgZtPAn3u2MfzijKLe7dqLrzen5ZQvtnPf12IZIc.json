Most music tours in the US are currently at risk. The culture cares about big transactions. A tour is symbolic of level because of the associated expense. Inferences are drawn and assumptions are made based on the city/run/venue sizes of an artists tour.\\n  * Question: Does this lead to pent up demand for music consumption?\\n  * Hallway, Claude, and I head to [Brockton Mass](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwi6zY_r7bj1AhUQU98KHaOfD4kQFnoECAUQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrockton.ma.us%2F&usg=AOvVaw38pQ65QR1x928EuPWYXdEV) to visit [VB Records](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9XBhdosH-0). VB is currently scheduled to Tour with Wu-Tang, but the tour may get cancelled. Plan to ask the team if Wu_Tang would consider opening for VB? Reasons why this would make sense:\\n    * 1. Wu-Tang would ‚Äúpass the torch‚Äù to VB with an official and public stamp.\\n    * 1. Wu-Tang would be introduced to a younger audience. Brand revitalization.\\n    * 1. Wu-Tang would be able invest in VB LLC, a high growth company that Wu-Tang can influence the outcome of with their endorsement. Tour/Road Show in one.\\n    * Clearing question: Is Wu-Tang focused on maximizing money or status?\\n\\n1/13/22\\n\\n* Status Community x shared exclusivity\\n* Audience Reactive Tokens\\n* Magic Internet Money - Cross Chain Stable Coin\\n* Connect McClenney x Glass x ZFogg\\n* Links\\n  * [Product Design Philosophy](https://businessofsoftware.org/2013/02/kathy-sierra-building-the-minimum-badass-user-business-of-software-a-masterclass-in-thinking-about-software-product-development/)\\n  * [Time](https://twitter.com/MIM_Spell) + [Wonderland Defi](https://www.wonderland.money/)\\n  * [Danielle Sesta](https://www.ipaddressguide.org/who-is-daniele-sesta-daniele-sestagalli-the-man-behind-wonderland-time-popsicle-finance-ice-and-abracadabra-mim/) -\\n  * <https://instagram.com/artiphon?utm_medium=copy_link>\\n  * [Jean Dawson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OXnC4rlOxE) üéß\\n* Calls: Justin K, Claude, McClenney, Greg\\n\\n1/12/22\\n\\n* Site Notes - Add feedback + instructions (how to use) + reaction counts\\n* FUTRxLGND Airdrop - Community build.

Very early, it was obvious to us that artists x crypto was a good idea, enabling independent artists to get paid and retain creative control (without giving away their rights). We immediately also saw the opportunity to support up & coming artists in new ways. Two years of research, experimentation, and fucking up have taught us a thing or two. We now clearly see the opportunity for us to start tell our story.
