"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"BTC prices surged over the weekend and pushed higher Monday amid expectations that an exchange-traded fund tracking futures contracts for the leading crypto would begin trading this week.\\n\\nProShares has said it plans to launch its Bitcoin Strategy ETF (ticker: BITO) Tuesday, which would be the first Bitcoin-linked ETF in the U.S.\\n\\nThe asset manager filed a “post-effective” registration statement Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, indicating that it had won regulatory approval for the fund. The New York Stock Exchange—where BITO is set to trade on the Arca Exchange—certified its approval for listing Friday.\\n\\n**Also read:** What a Bitcoin ETF Offers Investors\\n\\nThe price of Bitcoin jumped 6% from around $59,000 Friday to as much as $62,600 over the weekend, and was holding steady just under $62,000 on Monday. The crypto reached an all-time high of nearly $65,000 in April, and has climbed more than 425% since its price of around $12,000 in mid-October 2020.\\n\\nU.S. regulators have long pushed back against an ETF for Bitcoin itself amid wider caution over regulation in the crypto space. \\n\\nBut after SEC Chair Gary Gensler signaled that he would be open to the idea of a crypto ETF,  fund managers like ProShares and Invesco filed to operate Bitcoin futures ETFs amid speculation that these vehicles were more likely to be greenlit.\\n\\n“We believe a multitude of investors have been eagerly awaiting the launch of a Bitcoin-linked ETF after years of efforts to launch one,” said Michael L. Sapir, Proshares CEO.\\n\\n“BITO will open up exposure to Bitcoin to a large segment of investors who have a brokerage account and are comfortable buying stocks and ETFs, but do not desire to go through the hassle and learning curve of establishing another account with a cryptocurrency provider and creating a Bitcoin wallet or are concerned that these providers may be unregulated and subject to security risks,” Sapir said.\\n\\n**Plus:** Cathie Wood’s ARK Will Give Its Name to a New ETF for Bitcoin Futures\\n\\nAn ETF such as BITO would hold futures contracts representing bets on whether the price of Bitcoin will rise or fall, similar to ETFs tracking oil and other commodities.  While trading in Bitcoin itself remains unregulated, futures are traded on and regulated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange .\\n\\n“Why you would want to buy a bitcoin futures ETF instead of bitcoin itself escapes me. But if you are an investor that is mandated to only have exposure to regulated markets, then this could be your chance to get involved,” said Jeffrey Halley, an analyst at broker Oanda.\\n\\n“The all-time high around $65,000 is in sight, and a daily close above that level tilts the technical picture to further gains targeting $80,000 going forward,” Halley added.\",\"timestamp\":1634578234,\"title\":\"Bitcoin Prices Approach All-Time High in Run-Up to Futures ETF\"},\"digest\":\"IItVjocGpTo0pxUqORA8P0LWrXgoANRPlOrgRT_LKMw\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x65a5aBB63bb431a9B8377487d0A8cd2a797856f0\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iNZWMPXNCP6A12a6bv0ltDtdLTer-4ee5qrgHrYM2_w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8Ow82AZ2SXyPibunm_Z9-pHSj_H0zPkWYtHImfaGgGE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HKR_C0gU6J875LrrxuIU1jO_buxOfsW4LH7i26Xv4SDCfoW-xlZXTG-ej9tHbHFlToHJDYNiu1kxjeZm-d6SIw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xce61b65feba70a5f38e0d8c4baa02f9f2755465f376562098cbfa331ab2e629344a39b3d6353202839aedb5bace6f288632ae401128d08f02c019f84c1dda6ef1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"iNZWMPXNCP6A12a6bv0ltDtdLTer-4ee5qrgHrYM2_w\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"8Ow82AZ2SXyPibunm_Z9-pHSj_H0zPkWYtHImfaGgGE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"IItVjocGpTo0pxUqORA8P0LWrXgoANRPlOrgRT_LKMw\"}"
