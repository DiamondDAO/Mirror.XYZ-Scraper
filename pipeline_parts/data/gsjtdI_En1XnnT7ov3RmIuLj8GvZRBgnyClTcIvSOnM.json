"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"So when we start the crypto, a hardware wallet is compulsory. It can help secure our crypto. There is no big difference between hardware wallet and online ones like metamask or trust wallet or tp wallet, only when you need to approve and confirm a transaction, you have to operate on your hardware wallet. Therefore, people who have the hardware wallet can control your crypto wallet. \\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/3j8p0nvEKBccHC9D8HoBf.JPG?height=415&width=274)\\n\\nThe offical website price is better than these. \\n\\n[https://www.ledger.com/](https://www.ledger.com/)\\n\\nNow move on to which hardware wallet is better. Let’s talk about Ledger today. There are 2 types of Ledger on the market, nano X and S. Blue is another serious which I never saw on the website. X is bigger and thicker than S, and also better experienced. \\n\\nS is quite a small U-disk size, 2 operational buttons tiny size on the top, a few MB which only 2 chains installed to use, but it is always some mistake stop us to trade. There is a tip to resolve the problem. For example, BSC chain, you have to build 2 accounts(bsc 1 and bsc 2), then transfer bnb or other cryptos from bsc 1 to bsc 2. The ledger will show this on the tiny screen, confirm and continue, till the final reminder which asks you to review the transaction, Reject it. This is what I called “wake up” your ledger. Problem solved. \\n\\nNano X has a bigger screen and buttons also the memory, easy to operate. No similar problem was found since I have it, but the ledger live Synchronize has a bit problem. Some chain balance is not synchronized, however, the mobile end is fine. \\n\\nIf you are an NFT collector or trader, go for Nano X, and S for a backup. Eth lovers, go for it. However, you are always Defi on HUOBI heco chain, okex chain, ledger doesn’t support it. Check the chain you need before you buy. \\n\\nGood luck\\n\\n[https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1641360071,\"title\":\"Ledger nano X vs nano S\"},\"digest\":\"SWUa7M3Fw18XVNurWWERCtBd3Lx_u1jWGJ8sDKe2pMs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x4097292bCDd4A8976c6882CBE63Bd8468CB9Ac40\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TnAE2JRHgWzNJmW08dzz6u2itb1-Mdd_Q-oJ14LNnQE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"F8G8De123CYfNnbfK2oJ-T04dbplqr5bFUCITW4Q_QE\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"IBlJWB2soFQQ7nU16SuJOM1uwj7RY8jAlk8XxA1rnVnJrS3ZEFjCQ2yWH_8YK2LVliAY2TEr7KXbikKWPXKLAw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x87879948196fe8f2ba376479d5349d51ff27165f98373be5514393b7bc7ab668771d35fd2c6a01f0558b710600ba712ed686499f7741da9adeba90071352c1561c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"TnAE2JRHgWzNJmW08dzz6u2itb1-Mdd_Q-oJ14LNnQE\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"F8G8De123CYfNnbfK2oJ-T04dbplqr5bFUCITW4Q_QE\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"SWUa7M3Fw18XVNurWWERCtBd3Lx_u1jWGJ8sDKe2pMs\"}"
