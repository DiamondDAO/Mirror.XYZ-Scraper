"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"For anyone who hasn't learned about it yet, CityCoins is a project built on the Stacks blockchain which could potentially enable cities to leverage blockchain and DeFi technologies to pursue certain municipal goals and programs.\\n\\nAt the time of writing, [MiamiCoin has launched and since been accepted by the city](https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1437586010943246336?s=20), while NYCCoin has launched and [been endorsed by the city's mayor](https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1457803063666745346?s=20), without the city having formally accepted the project.\\n\\nWhat does it mean that MiamiCoin has been accepted by Miami, or for any given CityCoin to be accepted by its particular city? It has to do with the architecture of CityCoins itself.\\n\\nThe CityCoins protocol functions by incrementally issuing a supply of a given CityCoin, in lockstep with the Stacks blockchain, [with every increment being auctioned to STX bidders](https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/mining-citycoins). Every block added to the Stacks blockchain, from here to eternity, [designates a new issuance of the given CityCoin](https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/stacking-citycoins), at a rate that tapers off over an approximately 20-year timeframe.\\n\\nEvery bidding cycle is 2,100 blocks, or 2,100 issuances of a given CityCoin, which lasts around two weeks. The first cycle, cycle 0, is within the first time period of 10,000 blocks, and entails the minting of 250,000 CityCoins per block.\\n\\nOnce a supply of a given CityCoin is issued, it can be \\\"stacked\\\" by its recipient during the subsequent cycle of bidding. This means that the winner of the block(s) can invest their acquired CityCoin balance back into this bidding process by stacking it, and earn passive revenue in the form of STX.\\n\\nWhere does this passive revenue come from? The STX that accumulates in the bidding process gets automatically channeled, 70% to those stacking CityCoins, henceforth referred to as stackers, and 30% to the city treasury wallet.\\n\\nFor a given CityCoin to be \\\"accepted\\\" by a city, the city commission would need to accept into the city's budget the funds in this special wallet. [Miami has done this](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article254210608.html), New York City has yet to.\\n\\nOnce a city has accepted its CityCoin, it may go on to develop various utilities involving the CityCoin's protocols.\\n\\nFor example, a city may choose to reinvest some or all of its STX into the bidding process, in order to acquire a supply of the given CityCoin. To be clear, the city does not initially have any supply of its own CityCoin, and is not initially in charge of the issuance, but may eventually dictate some changes to the protocol itself. Time will tell.\\n\\nIn any case, once the city has acquired a supply of its own CityCoin, it may choose to distribute said supply among wallets reserved for its residents, who would have to prove their residency, perhaps through something like [jolocom](https://jolocom.io/).\\n\\nIf this were to happen, in the manner of a crypto UBI, city residents could choose to stack their CityCoin allowance, and earn passive income in STX, or they could sell it. They may eventually even borrow stablecoins against it, but this would go beyond the purview of the CityCoins protocol itself, and would require the resident to transfer their CityCoin balance to a lending platform, in order to use it as collateral. Unless, of course, someone builds a lending platform that can integrate directly with the CityCoin's protocol.\\n\\nWhat makes this arrangement even more interesting is something not inherent to CityCoins, but to Stacks. STX can also be stacked, this time to generate passive income in the form of BTC. This will provide ample motivation to acquire STX, and seeing as CityCoin stackers receive a passive income in the form of STX, it will also incentivize the acquisition of CityCoins.\\n\\nSo to go over it from the start: you bid STX for a chance to win a supply of a given CityCoin, and you stack that CityCoin to receive a portion of future STX bids, which you can either recycle into the bidding process or stack to receive a passive income in the form of BTC. This cyclical process generates constant revenue for the city as well as for CityCoin stackers.\\n\\nBut what if you bid STX and don't win any CityCoin? It is made clear that when you bid the STX, the STX is gone, but the chance of not receiving any CityCoin may be a deterrent for would-be bidders.\\n\\nThis is where a pool comes in, to spread out the risk as well as the reward. Joining a pool means contributing your STX to a collective fund, which can have a much higher chance of consistently winning blocks and acquiring a given CityCoin, at the cost of the CityCoin winnings being divided among pool members in proportion to their contribution.\\n\\nThis is also another thing that can be coordinated by a city agency. If the city coordinates a pool for its residents to join, it could virtually guarantee said residents some supply of the given CityCoin, be it NYCCoin or MiamiCoin or another one yet.\\n\\nResidents could eventually recoup their STX contributions to the pool by stacking their CityCoin winnings and earning that STX back.\\n\\nAside from passive income, in STX and by extension BTC, what other utilities could the various CityCoins develop? It would ultimately depend on what applications choose to integrate CityCoins and/or STX, but one major possibility is governance. If a given CityCoin can also function as a governance token, allowing holders to vote on any changes made to the protocol or perhaps even on matters beyond the protocol itself, its utility will increase in reflection of this.\\n\\nAnother potential program that can be facilitated via CityCoins, which would require legislation rather than mere permissionless app development, is a birth fund in which a supply of a given CityCoin is issued to a newly born resident and stacked for some number of bidding cycles, granting the newborn a passive income in STX. This program may depend on whether or not the stack duration could be made to exceed the current maximum of [16 months](https://docs.citycoins.co/citycoins-core-protocol/stacking-citycoins), or whether a smart contract could be written to automatically renew this stack duration, year after year.\\n\\nBeyond and including the examples given, the utility of a given CityCoin depends on the development of apps that integrate the given CityCoin's protocol. Whether or not the city itself may restrict apps that integrate such protocols and require developers to get permission first, is yet to be seen. That said, the permissionless nature of the protocol as it is, and of Stacks more broadly, may well persist in alignment with the city's incentives.\\n\\n \\n \",\"timestamp\":1637818726,\"title\":\"On the Municipal Utility of CityCoins\"},\"digest\":\"kYv0e7CODNWc4qmOeQueSxnwAZBYEbqa_9C-OrpFckM\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x384B334793db48a4e5f5E481C2B37D94e1326fC4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"soWNl26M0HAhk4rCCPuAPDR9y2eQEFzSKHG0qQwsrTM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ku-c7MBTjN406Frc_kvD41FmYkn9QKmTQ4EcBruoKQ\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"kwkrOkg_zlDRnuqOf4s5D4shNlE8vWJVBkNScL-j4j7AqmunjM3Y3HIyFWNJR0gI3F7PTwchOubkNLDABd96hw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9c61599887f47468551d4367caf1fe169f7ea17926ae737d0f65ef8bb370708a242995edd9aa4a77490e0fd34625767f9f5567dfae02fb1ccf17508ba4b072a61c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"soWNl26M0HAhk4rCCPuAPDR9y2eQEFzSKHG0qQwsrTM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"1ku-c7MBTjN406Frc_kvD41FmYkn9QKmTQ4EcBruoKQ\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"kYv0e7CODNWc4qmOeQueSxnwAZBYEbqa_9C-OrpFckM\"}"
