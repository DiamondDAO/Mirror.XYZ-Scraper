Should I try to implement WordPress again deal with all these plugins and buy a domain? Or be more simplistic and conservative and go with a platform like Medium? I couldn’t decide at all and was stuck in limbo with my decisions once again. \\n  \\n Until I found out about this platform! With Mirror being a decentralized blogging platform I thought it was the *perfect* place to combine both my passion for web3 and my passion for all things marketing. Both worlds collide and mash to create something new and amazing. I’m still learning the nicks and nacks of this service but will understand it in no time. \\n  \\n The central focus of this blog would be to keep a dated log on projects and interests I am passionate about and track my progress. While also being in a cycle of learning and applying in order to further my growth and development of my overall self. \\n\\nTopics such as marketing, photography, finance, NFTS, cryptocurrencies and even overall life advice will be seen and be developed as I explore this route in my life.\\n\\n**So what is the end goal?** \\n\\nTo be able to grow my projects and curate experience into my skills. In terms of being a better marketer and a potential activist in all things Web3 related. The journey starts here and I’m going to enjoy it.\",\"timestamp\":1642647322,\"title\":\"Branching out to new heights.\"},\"digest\":\"fbteyJZOyKb45ugHinS5E2drjiythOwfqJtHGaJWMWE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xd21675695d40982830472DE76Db775f8C725CF3B\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T0mPGzXEmNurb5OhHMQ6kMK11xURXNeDYpHQGuqpRGQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AZg6jfUuxiQ3YkAoAkcmqDt2onHItgGfjm--EujDqW8\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"FD8iWfTtgs2D8HArYmwSSwXlTG3Edg6OIw0YOFS46MjSWEewSZOV1ahmxr5T5qr-xwi7cwIzXoDkqZ27wV1Z_w\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xb9309d4ed576928ce510b22f46d5271e1f519e7e8916e4f9aaa583f5114e85e66a650c5653bb1162270a540f90bc652c5063f651631360f459327a3d17fe1e861b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"T0mPGzXEmNurb5OhHMQ6kMK11xURXNeDYpHQGuqpRGQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"AZg6jfUuxiQ3YkAoAkcmqDt2onHItgGfjm--EujDqW8\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"fbteyJZOyKb45ugHinS5E2drjiythOwfqJtHGaJWMWE\"}"
