Forbes has not updated these figures in two years, but weâ€™ve done our best to revise them in this section.\\n\\n### \\nForbesâ€™ Estimated F1 Team Values in November 2019\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/0RwQAluAegO3847vNiWCp.png?height=463&width=975)\\n\\n**In 2019**, Forbes ranked Ferrari as the most valuable team at **$1.35B** and Alfa Romeo the least valuable at **$105M**.\\n\\nSince this was published, we have two data points that should drive up team values. \\n\\n### First, thereâ€™s a budget cap in F1 now, which boosts team profits and values\\n\\n* In August 2020, all F1 teams signed a new agreement that places a budget cap from 2021 to 2026. \\n* Before this was signed, larger teams like Mercedes, Red Bull, and Ferrari outspent smaller teams by an order of magnitude \\n* Smaller teams could not keep up and nearly faced financial ruin Moving forward, the cost cap is expected to improve the economics for most teams and improve valuations \\n\\n### Second, McLaren sold a minority stake in 2020, revealing its value\\n\\n* In December 2020, MSP Sports Capital, a U.S. based sports investment group, [bought a stake](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-motor-f1-mclaren/mclaren-selling-minority-stake-in-f1-team-deal-to-value-it-at-560-million-sky-idUSKBN28M0X6) in McLaren racing\\n* MSP agreed to invest $245M over two years for a 33% stake in the team. **This valued the team \\\\~ 1 year ago at $740M, which is a 19% increase over Forbesâ€™ estimate from 2019.**\\n* One of the MSP investment groupâ€™s principals became a vice-chairman of McLaren Racing, while two others joined the McLaren Racing board as non-executive directors.\\n  * **This provides evidence that a minority investment group can have an active role in daily operations and governance!**\\n\\n### So, how much are F1 teams worth today? For now, letâ€™s take a simplistic approach and assume the following:\\n\\n* Forbesâ€™ 2019 team estimates were accurate, at the time\\n* All teams likely increased 19% in value from 2019 to 2020, based on the McLaren data\\n* Teams increased another 19% in value from 2020 to 2021, which is possible considering\\n  * Viewership is way up\\n  * Online engagement with F1 is also way up, [according to F1 itself](https://corp.formula1.com/formula-1-announces-audience-figures-for-2020/)\\n  * The new budget caps support increased team valuations\\n\\n**â€¦ which brings us to** [ðŸ‘‡](https://emojikeyboard.org/copy/Backhand_Index_Pointing_Down_Emoji_%F0%9F%91%87?utm_source=extlink)\\n\\n### Estimated F1 Team Values Today (Jan 2022)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ivkeFOD7yApPUj3xV3ig-.png?height=445&width=975)\\n\\nSo, there you have it! **We should be able to buy a 15% stake of Alfa Romeo for $22M. Want to aim higher? How about buying a 51% stake of Haas for $84M?** These figures may be large, but for less than the cost of a single Beeple NFT, we have a shot at owning a material portion of a Formula 1 team!\\n\\n## Options for Owning a Formula 1 Team\\n\\n### Preference #1: Buy an entire F1 team\\n\\n* **Estimated cost =** **$150M-1.9B** depending on the team\\n* **Pros**:\\n  * We would have full control over the future of the team\\n  * DAO members could vote on contract extensions, capital investments, driver selection, and more!\\n  * Incredible *perks*: members can visit training facilities, meet drivers, etc. o\\n* **Cons**:\\n  * Most teams probably do not want to sell.\\n  * Unclear if F1 would allow a DAO to be a majority owner of a team.\\n\\n[https://media.giphy.com/media/7YCBnmV8zHyhhOBNoP/giphy-downsized-large.gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/7YCBnmV8zHyhhOBNoP/giphy-downsized-large.gif)\\n\\n### Preference #2: Buy a minority stake in a F1 team\\n\\n* **Estimated cost: If we target 15% ownership, we need $22M for Alfa Romeo, $25M for Haas, $28M for Racing Point / Aston Martin**\\n* **Pros**:\\n  * The DAO would not be responsible for all operations\\n  * Token holders could still vote on some decisions if the majority owner agrees.\\n  * Perks from option 1 *might* carry over (and weâ€™d fight to make sure they do)\\n* **Cons**:\\n  * We would certainly lose some control in the process.\\n  * Will need a majority partner who values our input and contributions (Iâ€™m looking at you Gene and Guenther)\\n\\n### Preference #3: Start a team from scratch\\n\\n* **Estimated Cost: Prohibitively expensive**\\n* Under new F1 rules, a new entrant must pay $200M to the existing teams for the opportunity to participate. Then, we need to build facilities, hire staff, recruit drivers, and wait some time before being eligible for payments from the F1 organization\\n\\n### Realistically, we believe the path forward is to attempt acquiring a team like Alfa Romeo, Haas, or Aston Martin OR acquiring a minority stake in any team that would be a good partner.\\n\\nHow can I help?\\nâ€¢\\tJoin our discord\\nâ€¢\\tContribute ideas as we build the infrastructure to support fans across the world!\\n\\nIf we donâ€™t acquire a team, what happens?\\n\\nFAQ\\nâ€¢\\tWho are you?\\no\\tThe core team writing this launch paper has over a decade of fintech experience.
