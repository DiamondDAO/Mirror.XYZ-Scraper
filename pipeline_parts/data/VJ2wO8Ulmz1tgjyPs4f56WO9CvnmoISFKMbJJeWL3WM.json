"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Finding NFTs in 2021 changed my life. Struggling to enhance my existing Phd in digital materialism was a deadlock of failure. I spent days researching until I found digital collectables and how much people where spending on Crypto Punks, cats and apes (that looked bored).  \\n  \\n Digital ownership has never happend in history before. The internet never had this capability. The evolution of physical materialism to digital proved to be a wild west or gold rush of possibilities. \\n\\nThus, I was fast to change over my Phd. Not only was this month and months of work but it required a complete restructure of my thesis. During this time I was an active trader and entered the PV (Pixel Vault) community through minting two Punk Comic issue #1.  \\n  \\n At the time $1400 (.34 eth at the time) was a lot of fiat to drop on two digital comic books. This one investment 10x in a few months since I got it and not only that enabled me to get rare NFTs that paid me back ten fold. I also joined the PV DAO (a benefit of having the comic which proves NFTs can also be a smart collectable) discord channel and met some great people from all over the world. \\n\\nMy old Holden was breaking down. Being a film maker a lot of my funds in real life were exhausted from an independent feature (then covid hit which did not help) and teaching at the university all dried up due to covid…. NFT trading not only proved to be a better job but it was so much more profitable. I was able to get a brand new car (not a lambo yet but a R Line Passat VW 2021 was a nice luxurious buy for me -  by selling two PFP NFTs and Sandbox digital land. \\n  \\n One of my goals is to merge NFT and Film which is a monumental task many film makers are working on. I do believe we are close and 2022 could well be the year someone cracks this code.\\n\\nI also hope this year starts to see more mainstream adoption and less ‘Salty posts” of complete misinformation. There seems to be extreme hate for NFT that is more of a bandwagon effect where people are throwing around buzzwords of ‘Environment’, ‘Ponzi scheme’ and ‘Scam’ as big factors against this amazing technological change. A lot of this is simply not true. \\n\\nIn conclusion, i hope with the findings from my thesis that many people will see the importance, and significance that NFTs will bring to our future artists and how its such a better system than what we have. \",\"timestamp\":1642603826,\"title\":\"The Importance of NFT\"},\"digest\":\"xAyNpiUVtAfaNAwoyJND8Ew145DOOwdJ1VI04kJB8sc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x8CB4674BEcfe62e23bE8936F33c53D7AD785512a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"88vu8OWzeT0TQRk_6Hl_tqHqnNWtYKIXpmdmTJJLjtA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w9Sym9s7D5EdHcJY61qQockyNs63EX1IMovnBkStTiA\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"0hh6X18o5WKLqGfIel0i4CvwiGKAHEBZStzQVknjBC3FiNsHpHzuWveMTBBbdfALaoiU0P6jeH7GYZdPxIncWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xebbcb814e388eb393da613b2d25b550589dd88e10e1561a72fa4afcf2eb15fb21a39238b473ea90615d8c302a87e6e739cbf3120ba0877340e11e8d6f77700591b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"88vu8OWzeT0TQRk_6Hl_tqHqnNWtYKIXpmdmTJJLjtA\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"w9Sym9s7D5EdHcJY61qQockyNs63EX1IMovnBkStTiA\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"VJXxkpNJ7xsdurSgJHqsKUyrXwrBHKdvB0qzOC_TPkY\"}"
