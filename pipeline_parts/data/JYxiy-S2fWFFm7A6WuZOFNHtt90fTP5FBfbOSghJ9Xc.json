"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"You may have seen the term used casually in a Tweet.\\n\\nOr, maybe you heard your weird friend who does nothing but talk about pixelated JPEGS utter the phrase at that party a week ago.\\n\\nYou may have come across the acronym in a Discord server while you were right-click saving millions worth of art right into that “portfolio” folder on your desktop.\\n\\n**But, what the hell is a DAO? Why does it matter? And, most importantly, why should you care?**\\n\\nI have provided several resources for you below so you can explore the wonderful world of DAOs. These resources are organized in order of depth on the topic. Several examples of DAOs are included at the bottom of the list. I will leave much of the explanation to those who are more sophisticated and eloquent than I, but here’s a brief appetizer to put you in the proper emotional and digestive state so you can dive in.\\n\\n## DAOs Will Change the World\\n\\nA **Distributed Autonomous Organization**, or DAO, is a paradigm shift in how we define ownership, organizational design, and community governance. There are a number of applications already in the market today and many more are waiting to be dreamt of and implemented in the future.\\n\\n> From art, to business, to social capital, DAOs have cemented themselves as a cornerstone of the emerging ownership economy that favors **partnership** and **cooperation** rather than transactional relationships and value extraction.\\n\\nVery simply put, DAOs enable ownership. Think about owning a share of Apple stock. As the holder of that digital stock certificate, you *own* a piece of Apple. You have the right to vote on company initiatives, and you may benefit from increases in the company’s value or dividends that may be issued.\\n\\nA DAO creates **tokens** that are analogous to those Apple stock certificates. Those tokens can be either fungible tokens (interchangeable assets that may be used to transact like paper currency or Bitcoin) or non-fungible tokens (one-of-a-kind artworks or assets).\\n\\nAlright, so now your primed and ready to go. The bread and butter is nothing but crumbs.
