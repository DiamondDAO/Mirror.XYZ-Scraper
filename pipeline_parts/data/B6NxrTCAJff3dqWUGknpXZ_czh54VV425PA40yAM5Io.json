"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Some of this, however, I did during the day-time, when not attending the University classes.  The way in which I converted my bedroom into a brass foundry was as follows:  I took up the carpet so that there might be nothing but the bare boards to be injured by the heat.  My furnace in the grate was made of four plates of stout sheet-iron, lined with fire-brick, corner to corner.  To get the requisite sharp draught I bricked up with single bricks the front of the fireplace, leaving a hole at the back of the furnace for the short pipe just to fit into.  The fuel was generally gas coke and cinders saved from the kitchen.  The heat I raised was superb--a white heat, sufficient to melt in a crucible six or eight pounds of brass.\\n\\nThen I had a box of moulding sand, where the moulds were gently rammed in around the pattern previous to the casting.  But how did I get my brass?  All the old brassworks in my father's workshop drawers and boxes were laid under contribution.  This brass being for the most part soft and yellow, I made it extra hard by the addition of a due proportion of tin.  It was then capable of retaining a fine edge.  When I had exhausted the stock of old brass, I had to buy old copper, or new, in the form of ingot or tile copper, and when melted I added to it one-eighth of its weight of pure tin, which yielded the strongest alloy of the two metals.  When cast into any required form this was a treat to work, so sound and close was the grain, and so durable in resisting wear and tear.  This is the true bronze or gun metal.\\n\\nWhen melted, the liquid brass was let into the openings, until the whole of the moulds were filled.  After the metal cooled it was taken out; and when the room was sorted up no one could have known that my foundry operations had been carried on in my bedroom.  My brass foundry was right over my father's bedroom.  He had forbidden me to work late at night, as I did occasionally on the sly.  Sometimes when I ought to have been asleep I was detected by the sound of the ramming in of the sand of the moulding boxes.  On such occasions my father let me know that I was disobeying his orders by rapping on the ceiling of his bedroom with a slight wooden rod of ten feet that he kept for measuring purposes.  But I got over that difficulty by placing a bit of old carpet under my moulding boxes as a non-conductor of sound, so that no ramming could afterwards be heard. My dear mother also was afraid that I should damage my health by working so continuously.  She would come into the workroom late in the evening, when I was working at the lathe or the vice, and say, \\\"Ye'll kill yerself, laddie, by working so hard and so late\\\".  Yet she took a great pride in seeing me so busy and so happy.\\n\\nNearly the whole of my steam-engine models were made in my father's workroom.  His foot-lathe and stove, together with my brass casting arrangements in my bedroom, answered all my purposes in the way of model making.  But I had at times to avail myself of the smithy and foundry that my kind and worthy friend, George Douglass, had established in the neighbourhood.  He had begun business as \\\"a jobbing smith,\\\" but being a most intelligent and energetic workman, he shot ahead and laid the foundations of a large trade in steam-engines. When I had any part of a job in hand that was beyond the capabilities of my father's lathe, or my bedroom casting apparatus, I immediately went to Douglass's smithy, where every opportunity was afforded me for carrying on my larger class of work.\\n\\nHis place was only about five minutes' walk from my father's house. I had the use of his large turning-lathe, which was much more suitable for big or heavy work than the lathe at home.  When any considerable bit of steel or iron forging had to be done, a forge fire and anvil were always placed at my service.  In making my flywheels for the sectional models of steam-engines I had a rather neat and handy way of constructing them.  The boss of the wheel of brass was nicely bored; the arm-holes were carefully drilled and taped, so as to allow the arms which I had turned to be screwed in and appear like neat columns of round wrought iron or steel screwed into the boss of the flywheel.\\n\\nIn return for the great kindness of George Douglass in allowing me to have the use of his foundry, I resolved to present him with a specimen of my handiwork.  I desired to try my powers in making a more powerful steam-engine than I had as yet attempted to construct, in order to drive the large turning-lathe and the other tools and machinery of his small foundry.  I accordingly set to work and constructed a  direct-acting, high-pressure steam-engine, with a cylinder four inches in diameter.  I use the term direct acting, because I dispensed with the beam and parallel motion, which was generally considered the correct mode of transferring the action of the piston to the crank.\\n\\nThe result of my labours was a very efficient steam-engine, which set all the lathes and mechanical tools in brisk activity of movement. It had such an enlivening effect upon the workmen that George Douglass afterwards told me that the busy hum of the wheels, and the active, smooth, rhythmic sound of the merry little engine had, through some sympathetic agency, so quickened the stroke of every hammer, chisel, and file in his workmen's hands, that it nearly doubled the output of work for the same wages!\\n\\nThe sympathy of activity acting upon the workmen's hands cannot be better illustrated than by a story told me by my father.  A master tailor in a country town employed a number of workmen.  They had been to see some tragic melodrama performed by some players in a booth at the fair.  A very slow, doleful, but catching air was played, which so laid hold of the tailors' fancy that for some time after they were found slowly whistling or humming the doleful ditty, the movement of their needles keeping time to it; the result was that the clothing that should have been sent home on Saturday was not finished until the Wednesday following.  The music had done it!  The master tailor, being something of a philosopher, sent his men to the play again; but he arranged that they should be treated with lively merry airs. The result was that the lively airs displaced the doleful ditty; and the tailors' needles again reverted to even more than their accustomed quickness.\\n\\nHowever true the story may be, it touches an important principle in regard to the stimulation of activity by the rapid movements or sounds of machinery, which influence every workman within their sight or hearing.  We all know the influence of a quick merry air, played by fife and drum, upon the step and marching of a regiment of soldiers. It is the same with the quick movements of a steam-engine upon the activity of workmen.\\n\\nI may add that my worthy friend, George Douglass, derived other advantages from the construction of my steam-engine.  Being of an enterprising disposition he added another iron foundry to his smaller shops; he obtained many good engineering tools, and in course of time he began to make steam-engines for agricultural purposes.  These were used in lieu of horse power for thrashing corn, and performing several operations that used to be done by hand labour in the farmyards. Orders came in rapidly, and before long the chimneys of Douglass's steam-engines were as familiar in the country round Edinburgh as corn stacks.  All the large farms, especially in Midlothian and East Lothian, were supplied with his steam-engines. The business of George Douglass became very large; and in course of time he was enabled to retire with a considerable fortune.\\n\\nIn addition to the steam-engine which I presented to Douglass, I received an order to make another from a manufacturer of braiding. His machines had before been driven by hand labour; but as his business extended, the manufacturer employed me to furnish him with all engine of two-horse power, which was duly constructed and set to work, and gave him the highest satisfaction.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  James Nasmyth's Expansometer, 1826.\\n\\nI may here mention that one of my earliest attempts at original contrivance was an Expansometer--an instrument for measuring in bulk all metals and solid substances.  The object to be experimented on was introduced into a tube of brass, with as much water round it as to fill the tube.  The apparatus was then plunged into a vessel of boiling water, or heated to boiling point; when the total expansion of the bar was measured by a graduated scale, as seen in the annexed engraving. By this simple means the expansion of any material might be ascertained under various increments of heat, say from 60deg to 2l2deg. It was simply a thermometer, the mass marking its own expansion. Dr. Brewster was so much pleased with the apparatus that he described it and figured it in the Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, of which he was then editor.\\n\\n\\\\[Image\\\\]  The road steam-carriage.  By James Nasmyth.\\n\\nAbout the year 1827, when I was nineteen years old, the subject of steam carriages to run upon common roads occupied considerable attention.  Several engineers and mechanical schemers had tried their hands, but as yet no substantial results had come of their attempts to solve the problem.  Like others, I tried my hand.  Having made a small working model of a steam-carriage, I exhibited it before the members of the Scottish Society of Arts.  The performance of this active little machine was so gratifying to the Society that they requested me to construct one of such power as to enable four or six persons to be conveyed along the ordinary roads.  The members of the Society, in their individual capacity, subscribed #60, which they placed in my hands as the means for carrying out their project.\\n\\nI accordingly set to work at once.  I had the heavy parts of the engine and carriage done at Anderson's foundry at Leith.  There was in Anderson's employment a most able general mechanic named Robert Maclaughlan, who had served his time at Carmichaels' of Dundee. Anderson possessed some excellent tools, which enabled me to proceed rapidly with the work.  Besides, he was most friendly, and took much delight in being concerned in my enterprise.  This \\\"big job\\\" was executed in about four months.  The steam-carriage was completed and exhibited before the members of the Society of Arts.  Many successful trials were made with it on the queensferry Road, near Edinburgh. The runs were generally of four or five miles, with a load of eight passengers sitting on benches about three feet from the ground.\\n\\nThe experiments were continued for nearly three months, to the great satisfaction of the members.  I may mention that in my steam-carriage I employed the waste steam to create a blast or draught by discharging it into the short chimney of the boiler at its lowest part, and found it most effective.  I was not at that time aware that George Stephenson and others had adopted the same method; but it was afterwards gratifying to me to find that I had been correct as regards the important uses of the steam blast in the chimney.  In fact, it is to this use of the waste steam that we owe the practical success of the locomotive-engine as a tractive power on railways, especially at high speeds.\\n\\nThe Society of Arts did not attach any commercial value to my steam road-carriage.  It was merely as a matter of experiment that they had invited me to construct it.  When it proved successful they made me a present of the entire apparatus.  As I was anxious to get on with my studies, and to prepare for the work of practical engineering, I proceeded no further.  I broke up the steam-carriage and sold the two small high-pressure engines, provided with a compact and strong boiler, for #67, a sum which more than defrayed all the expenses of the construction and working of the machine.\\n\\nI still continued to make investigations as to the powers and capabilities of the steam-engine.  There were numerous breweries, distilleries, and other establishments, near Edinburgh, where such engines were at work.  As they were made by different engineers, I was desirous of seeing them and making sketches of them, especially when there was any special peculiarity in their construction.  I found this a most favourite and instructive occupation.  The engine tenters became very friendly with me, and they we re always glad to see me interested in them and their engines.  They were especially delighted to see me make \\\"drafts,\\\" as they called my sketches, of the engines under their charge.\\n\\nMy father sometimes feared that my too close and zealous application to engineering work might have a bad effect upon my health.  My bedroom work at brass casting, my foundry work at the making of steam-engines, and my studies at the University classes, were perhaps too much for a lad of my age, just when I was in the hobbledehoy state--between a boy and a man.  Whether his apprehensions were warranted or not, it did so happen that I was attacked with typhus fever in 1828, a disease that was then prevalent in Edinburgh.  I had a narrow escape from its fatal influence.  But thanks to my good constitution, and to careful nursing, I succeeded in throwing off the fever, and after due time recovered my usual health and strength.\\n\\nIn the course of my inspection of the engines made by different makers, I was impressed with the superiority of those made by the Carmichaels of Dundee.  They were excellent both in design and in execution. I afterwards found that the Carmichaels were among the first of the Scottish engine makers who gave due attention to the employment of improved mechanical tools, with the object of producing accurate work with greater ease, rapidity, and economy, than could possibly be effected by the hand labour of even the most skilful workmen.  I was told that the cause of the excellence of the Carmichaels' work was not only in the ability of the heads of the firm, but in their employment of the best engineers' tools.  Some of their leading men had worked at Maudslay's machine shop in London, the fame of which had already reached Dundee; and Maudslay's system of employing machine tools had been imported into the northern steam factory.\\n\\nI had on many occasions, when visiting the works where steam-engines were employed, heard of the name and fame of Maudslay.  I was told that his works were the very centre and climax of all that was excellent in mechanical workmanship.  These reports built up in my mind, at this early period of my aspirations, an earnest and hopeful desire that I might some day get a sight of Maudslay's celebrated works in London. In course of time it developed into a passion.  I will now proceed to show how my inmost desires were satisfied.\\n\\nCHAPTER 7.  Henry Maudslay, London\\n\\nThe chief object of my ambition was now to be taken on at Henry Maudslay's works in London.  I had heard so much of his engineering work, of his assortment of machine-making tools, and of the admirable organisation of his manufactory, that I longed to obtain employment there.  I was willing to labour, in however humble a capacity, in that far-famed workshop.\\n\\nI was aware that my father had not the means of paying the large premium required for placing me as an apprentice at Maudslay's works. I was also informed that Maudslay had ceased to take pupils. After experience, he found that the premium apprentices caused him much annoyance and irritation.  They came in \\\"gloves;\\\" their attendance was irregular; they spread a bad example amongst the regular apprentices and workmen; and on the whole they were found to be very disturbing elements in the work of the factory.\\n\\nIt therefore occurred to me that, by showing some specimens of my work and drawings, I might be able to satisfy Mr. Maudslay that I was not an amateur, but a regular working engineer.  With this object I set to work, and made with special care a most complete working model of a high-pressure engine.  The cylinder was 2 inches diameter, and the stroke 6 inches.  Every part of the engine, including the patterns, the castings, the forgings, were the results of my own individual handiwork.  I turned out this sample of my ability as an engineer workman in such a style as even now I should be proud to own.\\n\\nIn like manner I executed several specimens of my ability as a mechanical draughtsman; for I knew that Maudslay would thoroughly understand my ability to work after a plan.  Mechanical drawing is the alphabet of the engineer.  Without this the workman is merely a \\\"hand.\\\" With it he indicates the possession of \\\"a head\\\" I also made some samples of my skill in hand-sketching of machines, and parts of machines, in perspective--that is, as such objects really appear when set before us in their natural aspect.  I was the more desirous of exhibiting the ability which I possessed in mechanical draughtsmanship, as I knew it to be a somewhat rare and much-valued acquirement. It was a branch of delineative art that my father had carefully taught me. Throughout my professional life I have found this art to be of the utmost practical value.\\n\\nHaving thus provided myself with such visible and tangible evidences  of my capabilities as a young engineer, I carefully packed up my  working model and drawings, and prepared to start for London. On the 19th of May 1829, accompanied by my father, I set sail by the Leith smack Edinburgh Castle, Captain Orr, master.  After a pleasant voyage of four days we reached the mouth of the Thames.  We sailed up from the Nore on Saturday afternoon, lifted up, as it were, by the tide, for it was almost a dead calm the whole way.\\n\\n[ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/33](ethereum://0x60f80121c31a0d46b5279700f9df786054aa5ee5/33)\\n\\n\",\"timestamp\":1639288980,\"title\":\"\\nI got up early in the mornings to work at my father's lathe, and I sat up late at night to do the brass castings in my bedroom.\"},\"digest\":\"MR8DRJjTDlItq08OigUdPfUJB_rh-nrx2kFfgF-gHQ0\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x667E6054E728f4dC76df3f0F3c9c6bf23c751e8a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RBAvhhVteWjtlh_DeHY1st9dEW73VrUARSqQvFvRZAw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUTpM5wdzQYeCJIM1k8L6VfJ5q0FXyHHmXPkumYteBI\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"jin9gNgz48JDXQDdH1HXCBaYEuigzjTMeCW9jG1-BO-J9eLXfYTEqC041ifYwN0CYTtW27JcuquoPbP3V_xNnw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xee639ee169bb017135bced43f62c772735fbc8582cd1496631a0061bf99d614a029f7c229113b1e05f264c81e0c27bf74a528d9e930897259129ac137930d0541c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"RBAvhhVteWjtlh_DeHY1st9dEW73VrUARSqQvFvRZAw\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nUTpM5wdzQYeCJIM1k8L6VfJ5q0FXyHHmXPkumYteBI\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MR8DRJjTDlItq08OigUdPfUJB_rh-nrx2kFfgF-gHQ0\"}"
