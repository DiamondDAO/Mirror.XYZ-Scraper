While everyone had been wondering who would voice the new raccoon character, Mila and Ashton, in [a really cool personal video to the community](https://twitter.com/stonercatstv/status/1459930201526181893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1459930201526181893%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1\\\\_\\\\&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublish.twitter.com%2F%3Fquery%3Dhttps3A2F2Ftwitter.com2Fstonercatstv2Fstatus2F1459930201526181893widget%3DTweet), dropped the mic with the “GARY VEE” announcement! An announcement which turned NFT heads everywhere and brought some awesome new people over to check out Ms. Stoner and her cats.\\n\\n“The Stoner Cats Unofficial Podcast” Episode 9 also aired with community member [Lisa Sterbakov](https://twitter.com/lisasterb) coming back to chat with the community and drop the long-awaited announcement for 6th Wall’s incoming CEO. *(6th Wall is formerly named 3050 Gang)*\\n\\n6th Wall struck gold in acquiring one of the leading creatives of Web3, [Lindsey McInerny](https://www.awexr.com/usa-2021/speaker/2517-lindsey-mcinerney). She’s a futurist with big ideas about the intersection of blockchain technology and the ecosystem of entertainment. “How can we add value to the communities that we operate in, and allow that community to come along for the journey, as we kick down doors and push boundaries of what that can look like?” (McInerny)\\n\\nThe future just shifted on its axis.\\n\\nWe also sat down for a “Creators Community Call” (post Episode 2 drop) with for a little Q and A sesh. We were introduced to [Dan Jeup](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0422371/), who came in and partnered up with Ash on some monumental drawing tasks.\\n\\nThe super-humans over at [Ghostbot ](https://www.ghostbot.com/)humbly received some accolades. It was really nice to see them look up from their computers and accept a well-earned compliment.\\n\\nAsh, Sarah, and Chris continually offered insights into the reality of “Behind the Scenes” footage, what it means to work non-stop for several months on end (seriously, not ***one*** day off) and the best reminder that this show started about one thing… the journey of Ms. Stoner and her faithful, loving, charismatic, stoner cats, but is quickly becoming the blueprint for what entertainment can (and will) be in the world of Web3.\\n\\nIf you haven’t experienced one of the “Creator Commeownity Calls”, or at least watched a recording of one on [You Tube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InhoD3nzwr4), ***you are missing the best part of this project.***\\n\\nWe also kicked off the first-of-its-kind blockchain watch party in Discord. From there, Sarah, Ash, and Chris popped in for a most lovely, unexpected chat. A *lot* was shared, and our family has *undeniably* been born.\\n\\nWhat I’ve learned about being involved in *Stoner Cats* is that I’m now a part of this project with these creators. When I watch the credits scroll at the end of the episode, I not only recognize 99% of the names listed, but I’ve been on Zoom calls and chats in Discord with most of them as well. I know a little about their lives. I know their faces, their smiles, and I have heard their laughs. The credits for me were always my cue to turn the channel, or my cue that it was time to get up and leave the theatre. With *Stoner Cats* that is simply no longer the case.\\n\\nThe credits are the *story *behind the story.\\n\\nWeb3. It’s personal.\\n\",\"timestamp\":1637769975,\"title\":\"Stoner Cats: Episode 2 - MetawoodStudios - Medium\"},\"digest\":\"oX7sZlNpKvuX0ph0Q0Xsy-a4x5P4HpZLTJMzEYr_nTA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x73F94796a25853A26f5AD5b9Bc29348F4EE7D53c\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NQlKURYs0mExR0OHQ1Hk9tiGRlFEMNcNSUGz1M0MalM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jp3qLv-AGxV_9hOkSzipJei42nzwF9hdP0nnb-F19F4\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"HJNNLgax3kRkUzoPLUl7GWHp1alWpqGXSeWvpMD5aG35Bod6lUs8r_QeWd-tq_cSOb__Qf0y1j_B5JTMMRgxIQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x7b4034b1eb31b62e5264ed932c51657ee2fbd7fd35db9f79a1a8175de373276a6d2d7d6fe9350b32cfc4d920f8eff0ce3ee8a259375290a5b6fc1872af800ad400\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"NQlKURYs0mExR0OHQ1Hk9tiGRlFEMNcNSUGz1M0MalM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"jp3qLv-AGxV_9hOkSzipJei42nzwF9hdP0nnb-F19F4\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"oX7sZlNpKvuX0ph0Q0Xsy-a4x5P4HpZLTJMzEYr_nTA\"}"
