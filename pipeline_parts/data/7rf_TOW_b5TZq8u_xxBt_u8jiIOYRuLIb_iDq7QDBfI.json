"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"In corporate records, Apache lists only a handful of officers in the company, with no mention of Walters or Huebner.\\n\\nIn a statement to Insider, two Apache executives who identified themselves as Ira Glasser and Roger Flowers, minimized Walters' and Huebner's involvement with the company, describing them as \\\"consultants.\\\" \\n\\nIn a lawsuit uncovered by Insider that was filed jointly by Walters and Apache last year against the insurance company USAA General Indemnity in Nevada's Eighth Judicial District Court, Walters identifies himself as Apache's \\\"controlling shareholder.\\\" That civil case was later dismissed.\\n\\nGlasser, the Apache executive, denied that Walters was a controlling shareholder in the company.  \\n\\nAccording to court records, Walters has a criminal history. \\n\\nHe was convicted of fifteen felony charges related to fraud in Clark County, Nevada, in 2008 and sentenced to at least eight years in prison and over $600,000 in restitution fines to victims he was found to have bilked of money. The case was tied to an accusation that Walters had forged a deed to improperly take possession of a Las Vegas home and then had used it as collateral to borrow money against.\\n\\nSome of those charges were vacated in 2016, and his convictions were reduced to two felonies for possessing a financial forgery laboratory. Walters, who by then had spent several years in prison, was released on time served, and his restitution was lowered to just over $500,000.\\n\\nThat was Walters' second stint in prison. In the early 2000s, he was convicted of possessing cocaine and incarcerated in Indiana.\\n\\nHe was also previously the CEO of a company that was implicated by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a pump-and-dump stock scheme, but he wasn't accused of any wrongdoing in that matter and, at the time, denied knowledge of the allegations.\\n\\nHuebner, who is listed as the registered agent for Apache in corporate records, was convicted on criminal charges in the mid-1990s for his involvement helping people attempt to avoid paying money they owed to the IRS by declaring bankruptcy and wiping the debts clean.\\n\\nApache, meanwhile, is being sued in Nevada court by a former employee, Denise Mraz, who alleges she outlaid $45,000 to cover personal expenses for Walters, including his rent, gas, food, and cellphone bills and was never repaid. She said that she took out a $275,000 personal loan to purchase equity in the company, but that after she gave Apache the money, it claimed it couldn't issue any more stock, but kept her cash.\\n\\nIn the suit, she accuses Apache of misrepresenting its portfolio of mining claims and technical capabilities to extract metals from sites in order to mislead prospective investors.\\n\\n\\\"Apache is nothing more than a front for Walters and Huebner's illegal activities,\\\" Mraz's complaint alleges.\\n\\nThat case will go to trial next year. Mraz's lawyer declined to comment. Apache didn't comment on the Mraz suit.\\n\\nSwig appeared unbothered by Apache's dubious past.\\n\\n\\\"Apache has been very good, very safe, very straightforward,\\\" Swig told Insider. \\\"We have checked them out. I would just say in this particular kind of business, there's a lot of clutter in the world that is not necessarily accurate from my point of view.\\\"\\n\\nA spokesman for Swig said Walters and Huebner had \\\"paid their debt to society\\\" and that their involvement in Apache was \\\"not our concern.\\\"\\n\\n## \",\"timestamp\":1638368916,\"title\":\"Consultants with a criminal past\"},\"digest\":\"1ZXiWkHu2lilzosyjBMZ4MjH5WBh1Uq-RBcYypfdk-c\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1038e4F71522CAca5DA23A44eC021E14804b7a4f\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyES6LE4bRrzouB-2gICZTicmqtOrbOD3E1visnVSxM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZodbuTuqFoiQJX4P1NH3-1W96JinmrsiTY3L5rm8XAw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4J8roKA8R74D8Q7Rds4X-amg3-xz7asf11o0gdscSuQpcKaw5P5Jh4k8F2QU0ZB5k_QXYVgdhNMq7dQYQM_D_Q\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xd4a09ac089ba810f84763fc648fd6a1916f1086c072168e6fcd812b6ee9881305688d6f2282670ca5067be7040d74971c66ff5dfb241ddbaa690eca2d69010881c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uyES6LE4bRrzouB-2gICZTicmqtOrbOD3E1visnVSxM\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"ZodbuTuqFoiQJX4P1NH3-1W96JinmrsiTY3L5rm8XAw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1ZXiWkHu2lilzosyjBMZ4MjH5WBh1Uq-RBcYypfdk-c\"}"
