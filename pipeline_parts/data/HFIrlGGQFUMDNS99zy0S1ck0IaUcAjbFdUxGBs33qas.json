"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"As Elon Musk puts it, \\\"the most interesting outcomes are the most likely things to happen\\\".\\n\\nSo, here are my 5 unusual predictions for web3, and I'll detail how I came to these ideas below:\\n\\n1. Pokemon trainers will be a full-time job\\n2. Someone will use a JPEG-enabled loan to buy a home\\n3. There will be a DAO to buy a public company\\n4. DeFi will be massively adopted by those who don’t even know what DeFi is\\n5. A blue chip company will create its own token\\n\\nHopefully these give you an idea of ​​why I'm excited about the future of Web3, whether or not the macro market turns bearish with this year's rate hikes and more aggressive tightening.\\n\\nIncreased awareness of Web3, crypto and blockchain\\nWeb3.0\\n\\nBefore we dive deeper into the topics covered by my predictions, let's take a quick look at the crypto landscape as we head into 2022.\\n\\nOver the past few years, we have seen increased awareness and adoption of many crypto and blockchain use cases, including DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, GameFi, and the Metaverse.\\n\\nDue to the increased awareness, cryptoassets in these areas have exploded and achieved outsize compared to the entire crypto market.\\n\\nSome trends are relatively easy to predict, others are more surprising and come faster than expected.\\n\\nFor example, Facebook changed its name to Meta, which led to a surge in tokens related to the Metaverse.\\n\\nLet’s dive deeper into the main themes underpinning these predictions:\\n\\n1. GameFi upgrade\\n\\nWeb3.0\\n\\nIn 2013, MtGox was the largest Bitcoin exchange in the space.\\n\\nInterestingly, MtGox started out as an exchange place for MagicTheGathering players to exchange cards.\\n\\nSince then, the cryptocurrency market has returned to gaming.\\n\\nGaming has always seemed to be an industry waiting to be disrupted by blockchain technology.\\n\\nIn fact, Vitalik Buterin's inspiration for creating Ethereum came from his bad experience playing World of Warcraft!\\n\\nToday, the convergence of gaming and crypto takes many forms, from using NFTs as in-game items, to creating in-game currencies and in-game economies with real-life value.\\n\\nA big recent success story is Axie Infinity and its adoption in countries like the Philippines.\\n\\nSadly, many Filipinos have lost their businesses and jobs, and many livelihoods have been destroyed during the pandemic lockdown.\\n\\nFor this reason, many people have started playing P2E (play and earn) games like Axie Infinity to replace or supplement their income.\\n\\nIn many cases, this new income is more than their previous income.\\n\\nNow, imagine a blockbuster game like Pokemon Go, where each Pokemon is actually an NFT with limited supply in real life.\\n\\nSome Pokemon may even be unique. Imagine if there were only 1000 Mewtwos in the world and you got one and put it on an exchange.\\n\\nHow much is it worth?\\n\\nMy guess is that it's easily over $1 million, meaning skilled players will have enough incentive to turn it into a full-time career.\\n\\nMaybe it sounds far-fetched?\\n\\nBut don't forget that the reality is that people are already making decent income through P2E, and this potential may increase in the coming years.\\n\\n1. DeFi 2.0 growth\\n\\nWeb3.0\\n\\nThis bull run started with meaningful adoption of many DeFi platforms and in many cases outpacing traditional financial competitors (e.g. Uniswap volume vs most centralized exchanges).\\n\\nDuring the first wave of DeFi, some key subtypes came to the fore, including decentralized lending, decentralized exchanges, automated market makers (AMMs), and synthetic assets such as synthetic stocks, gold, and stablecoins.\\n\\nSome describe these as money Lego, or the building blocks that slowly engulf and replace the entire traditional financial sector through combinations.\\n\\nAn example of a platform that combines aspects of \\\"Money Lego\\\" is the Mirror Protocol, which allows you to buy a synthetic version of a stock.\\n\\nTesla, for example, then provides that stock and some stablecoins into the pool as liquidity. Then, you can start earning from trading fees for trading pairs.\\n\\nOver the past few years, the DeFi space has continued to evolve, improve, and combine aspects of these “money Lego bricks.”\\n\\nI believe the next big step in this area will be the emergence of more retail-friendly user interfaces.\\n\\nWe will start to see regular apps in app stores that will enable users to access DeFi-level benefits while being easy to use and without the crypto/blockchain element felt to the user.\\n\\nOne example is Coinbase offering customers stablecoin earnings by using Compound in the background.\\n\\nAnother area that I think will see some cool innovation is the intersection of NFTs and DeFi.\\n\\nNFTs can represent almost any digital asset.\\n\\nCommon use cases you probably know are art and collectibles.\\n\\nBut let's consider another valuable online asset, such as a domain name. For example, let's say you own the domain name \\\"[shop.com](http://shop.com)\\\".\\n\\nThis is obviously a very expensive domain name because it is easy to remember, has keywords and has high commercial value.\\n\\nSo assuming you own it, its theoretical value is $10 million.\\n\\nIn Web2, you can't do anything but wait for someone to buy it or use it yourself.\\n\\nIn Web3, we can turn a domain name into an NFT and then use $10 million worth of assets as collateral to get a loan.\\n\\nAll of this can happen in minutes and without permission.\\n\\nIt's a lot easier than taking a loan from a brick and mortar bank, where you spend weeks applying, managing, interviewing, and potentially getting rejected for a loan.\\n\\n...or maybe you own an NFT that's just a picture of a rock, but worth over $1 million...why can't you take out a loan to buy a house?\\n\\nInteresting to go to this domain and see who owns [www.defi.io](http://www.defi.io)\\n\\n1. DAOs go mainstream\\n\\nWeb3.0\\n\\nFor those who don't know what a DAO is, it stands for Decentralized Autonomous Organization.\\n\\nThe main feature of DAOs is decentralized governance.\\n\\nUsually, when you invest in DAOs, you receive tokens in return, and you can use these DAO tokens as voting rights in the organization.\\n\\nA well-known example you may have heard of is the Constitutional DAO. A DAO created to buy the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\nThey didn't win the auction, but it's amazing that the DAO was able to raise $47 million at such an insane rate.\\n\\nNow compare that to the time and all the processes it takes for a government to raise money and get something done, such as taking steps to combat climate change, donating money to third world countries or countries in crisis.\\n\\nImagine the time it takes to decide how the money will be spent, and the amount of money the middleman needs to chop off before the money reaches its intended destination.\\n\\nUsing a DAO, you can raise funds for a cause very quickly, efficiently and effectively, and then use smart contracts and a highly transparent blockchain to ensure that the funds are used only for that cause.\\n\\n1. \\\"Encryption\\\" reshapes \\\"Web3\\\"\\n\\nWeb3.0\\n\\nWeb3 is one of the greatest rebrands we've seen this year.\\n\\nThere have been some pretty big rebrands though, including Facebook to Meta and Square to Block.\\n\\nIn encryption, we have been using the term Web3 for a while.\\n\\nWeb3 alludes to a new dimension currently being added to the web: the \\\"Internet of Value\\\".\\n\\nHowever, many people don't realize that this rebranding has had a huge impact.\\n\\nThe word crypto has some unfortunate reputational issues, as its openness and liquidity have led to some extreme volatility, dishonest actors, and unethical air projects.\\n\\nRecently an old colleague called me and he told me he wanted to learn Solidity.\\n\\nPreviously, he had been skeptical of cryptocurrencies due to the so-called \\\"speculative nature.\\\"\\n\\nOn the other hand, Web3 feels more like a more appropriate description of what is actually happening in the crypto space today, which has evolved from digital cash to wider utility.\\n\\nAs crypto technology matures and the reputation of the space improves, we will see more institutional investors add crypto to their investment plans.\\n\\nSquare, Tesla, Microstrategy, and many others have added Bitcoin.\\n\\nSome added Ethereum, and just last week, Deutsche Telekom announced that they were adding Polkadot to their portfolio.\\n\\nThe world of traditional finance will inevitably merge and will eventually be engulfed by the Internet of Value.\\n\\nWe will soon realize that many will realize the advantages of doing an ICO versus an IPO.\",\"timestamp\":1641779746,\"title\":\"5 predictions for Web 3 in 2022: DAOs will go mainstream\"},\"digest\":\"ceicjld4u7JLs3eLnnaANg7e0vx2pb0boMEupqFmi8w\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x19a23AfB21e123c626C2c4C19c34d2037Ac35734\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SBF-xzKo-4CXbpeQd-ZfwjWV5Jl36G4DglYgMXjohuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L0NT7vLNUSSV-i13NO5L-ER-Yee0jslZytOsar9e4mw\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"8KDKvGeOD1RHcxYRbs9u2xfpBY9tPH2Z4HQvWapnqjXds7bIEocD1GnujBHq9lWhHufdPn69voaJNgMAWV9kcw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x6ed4dc6bc1f335f9281d7758a218774620895152a6c70798e4b29d9f80adcbeb15b72d3e9736840814c5e58635708219b9df33f0148564985b97a055f8adc8cd1b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"SBF-xzKo-4CXbpeQd-ZfwjWV5Jl36G4DglYgMXjohuQ\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"L0NT7vLNUSSV-i13NO5L-ER-Yee0jslZytOsar9e4mw\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"ceicjld4u7JLs3eLnnaANg7e0vx2pb0boMEupqFmi8w\"}"
