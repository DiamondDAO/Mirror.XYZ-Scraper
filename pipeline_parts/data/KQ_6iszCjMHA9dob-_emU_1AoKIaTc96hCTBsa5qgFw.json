"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Waiting in the station was not going as I had imagined. When I had, she sauntered up to me, long legs wrapped in red leather boots, fur gleaming. She touched my cheek and asked me if I was looking for a fun night.\\n\\nBut instead the station was crowded... packed. People were pushing, bustling past me, blocking my view of her beautiful body. And there was a smell I'd never smelled before, a combination of things I couldn't put my finger on except for one that was distinctly fishy.\\n\\nAfter I had gotten over the shock that Craigslist was still around 750 years later I had put out an ad for a guide. He's the one who brought me here, showed her to me. He disdainfully called her a prostitute, but it was less about what she did and more about what she was; a mutant human, a cat lady. \\\"If you're into that sort of thing,\\\" he had said. Boy, was I ever.\\n\\n'Foreign visitor seeking a guide' had been my ad. I couldn't say what I really was, my predicament was top secret. It was 'promise not to tell', or stay locked up for the whole time. I was a time transfer, part of a top secret program to learn more about the past, or maybe to change it, I wasn't sure. Me, a thirty-year-old female government secretary, trapped in the body of a gorgeous male spy historian.\\n\\nI would much rather have had this body's wife as a guide. But she'd packed up and left when she found out he was going on another mission. It would've been nice to have someone who knew why I was so naive show me around but she didn't want to see someone else piloting her husband. I get it. She eventually did come home. She didn't speak much, wouldn't let me speak, just promptly removed my clothes and showed me exactly what she'd been missing. It was a good night.\\n\\nThe guide hadn't returned my calls after the first time out. I guess he wasn't buying my second rumspringa story. Apparently, all the amish had moved to French-Canada and I didn't have the accent for it. Or maybe it was the questions about the mutants that I asked, forcing him to tell me more about them. I should've just asked my Google-Robot, but then he wouldn't have brought me here to see her. To, \\\"show me the mutants in action,\\\" he had said.\\n\\nShe was standing, talking with a group of lizard men. They looked huge next to her. Her black fur glinted in the light of the station and every once and a while she tilted her head back and laughed. I could barely hear it from where I sat. She was never going to notice me, and I was never going to get the courage to go up and talk to her.\\n\\nThe watch at my wrist beeped. One hour left till this body was no longer mine and I was catapulted back in time to my pitiful apartment. What was he doing with my body? What historical secrets had he poached from my existence? Had he touched my boobs? Probably. I'd certainly touched him, all over.\\n\\nI felt a twinge of guilt, he wouldn't want me here. I stood up, finally ready to leave and heard a soft thump behind me.\\n\\n\\\"Tired of waiting for her to notice you, sweety?\\\" The voice was high, feminine and mocking. I looked back to see a toothy smile on a feline face. She was perched on the bench behind me, a calico; orange, black and white, tail flicking behind her.\\n\\nI started to walk away, embarrassed I'd been caught, afraid of why she'd noticed me. I heard scratching noises to my left and then two feet from the stairs she was suddenly in front of me. She was short and so close to me I could see down her tank top. Fur on every inch I could see and I wondered if the fur continued where I couldn't see.\\n\\nBetween the large ears on the top of her head was a mop of calico curls, she stared up at me with wide eyes.\\n\\n\\\"I could be your fun time,\\\" she said, and I wondered if she'd read my thoughts. I nodded, dumbly.\\n\\n\\\"Where's your car, handsome?\\\" she asked, leading me up the stairs.\\n\\n\\\"I took the bus,\\\" I responded, trying to sound mysterious. I always liked mysterious men.\\n\\nHer peal of laughter echoed up the stairs and I could feel myself blushing. This was not going well.\\n\\nI tried to keep my stupid mouth shut as I followed her through the crowded alleys across from the station.\\n\\nShe had something on resembling shorts, but more like jean underwear, and the gap allowing her tail to roam drew my attention most of all.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at her apartment she showed me just how much of her was covered in fur. When she purred, I purred. And as the final seconds counted down to the end of my time transfer I pulled her tail and she howled. Two beasts fulfilled, centuries apart.\",\"timestamp\":1641016561,\"title\":\"Time Transfer (07/18)\"},\"digest\":\"W3pLPp8L22gBo5tcM9SVMsetlgXyXB2ga4QcrNr_SmQ\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xfEdFdbf78FfC9d6ed6255D3C7E7f5DC676f6bEc9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_sT_s2mZSaDdkWFjKv6z8yr3Yv2VDiRSUTHRoZ-7x6o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4gS4TOmJs1yV_7puAVTCtCIAHt_aLfV4xvXoZwWO3wY\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"a4mIRXHB_ZJIoZNYoVd8fRsoFkvUsLXFM1ChZNB--e4UoE6q9CmziC_-2BDWovUg7bmyPwKcdG_iJmId_M20jw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x43805d19257a1a8cf0cc738dff593ffcfcd684ba89c743c118353803535a2af163f531342939a837d7a6b8062e22285d6106620613bbfe8850f50c5c51b5a5bd1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"alg\\\":\\\"ES256\\\",\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_sT_s2mZSaDdkWFjKv6z8yr3Yv2VDiRSUTHRoZ-7x6o\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"4gS4TOmJs1yV_7puAVTCtCIAHt_aLfV4xvXoZwWO3wY\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"jUVn5OTs7t3Cju1sIaa0iOhZp3X3sBrpaYaY-4gvXok\"}"
