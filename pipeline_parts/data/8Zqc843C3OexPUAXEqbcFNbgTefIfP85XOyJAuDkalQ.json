Important to note, these are users who made a transaction through a wallet. The 25,000 figure is fairly higher than the average AMM or DEX, which tends to see around 5,000 users per day day. The team at Axie Infinity claims to have \\\\~1 million DAUs, therefore a \\\\~2.5% user count doing active wallet interactions is a rather healthy indication.

According to Axie Infinity‚Äôs data, the cumulative volume of assets transacted in Axie crossed north of $1 billion in the past month. While much of it has been in the recent past, the chart is a testament to the perseverance and grit of the team over the years. Axie Infinity is proof that product market fit kicking in can lead to exponential growth.

Close to \\\\~200 wallets have accumulated north of 10,000 tokens over the past six months. The recent price rise has not translated to a sell-off among the large wallets.\\n\\n    Part of the reason for this may be due to the fact that creating cash flow out of Axie Infinity tokens is possible through programs like those offered by YGG, standing as a proof-point that individuals building a position in Axie still believe there is long-term upside despite the recent massive rally.¬†(Source: Santiment)\\n\\n[![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w\\\\_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5d8c721-72b3-4ccf-871d-cd07950e84d3\\\\_1350x762.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5d8c721-72b3-4ccf-871d-cd07950e84d3\\\\_1350x762.png)\\n\\n***\\n## ‚ë°¬†Mirror\\n**üë•¬†[Andrew Hong](https://twitter.com/andrewhong5297)\\nüìà 1850+ ETH Raised by Creators and Communities\\nüèÅ¬†[Join the Write Race](https://mirror.xyz/race)\\nüîé¬†[Check out the dashboard](https://dune.xyz/ilemi/Mirror)**\\n\\n*   Mirror is a crypto-based publishing platform that aims to connect creators directly with their audience using a combination of Web2 and Web3 native tooling.
