It‚Äôs always 5 o‚Äôclock somewhere.\\n\\nSome things last. Some things are lost. Mileage (and gas fees) may vary.\\n\\nSo‚Ä¶ years before I‚Äôd learned there was a chain to even be *on*, I was irked by the immutability of our digital detritus ‚Äî¬†more immortal than the soul.\\n\\nOr maybe I was sorta haunted leaving all my breadcrumbs back to nowhere?\\n\\nEventual nowhere.

I was selected by former US poet laureate Robert Pinsky as a finalist for the Dorset Prize, and I‚Äôve served as a visiting editor for the Beloit Poetry Journal.\\n\\n**My poems have appeared in:**\\n\\n* POETRY Magazine\\n* The Poetry Review\\n* Prairie Schooner\\n* Poetry Northwest\\n* Beloit Poetry Journal\\n* The Cincinnati Review\\n* Cimarron Review\\n* RHINO\\n* Magma Poetry\\n* Boulevard\\n* Arsenic Lobster\\n* Pacifica Literary Review\\n* Port City Poets (Anthology)\\n* Maine Arts Journal\\n* And more\\n\\nI‚Äôve performed my poems at a number of reading series, including Literary Death Match, Stone Boat, Local Buzz, The Maine Historical Society‚Äôs Summer Garden Series, the Belfast Poetry Festival, and more.\\n\\nI‚Äôm new to this whole ‚Äúweb3‚Äù world, but racing to catch up fast.
