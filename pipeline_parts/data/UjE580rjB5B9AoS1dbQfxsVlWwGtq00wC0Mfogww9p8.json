The New York Times recapped what he said on this fateful call:\\n\\n“This is the second time in my career I’m doing this and I do not — do not want to do this,” he said in the call, recordings of which were widely shared online. “The last time I did it, I cried. This time I hope to be stronger.”\\n\\nHe said employees were being laid off for reasons including the market, performance and productivity. “If you’re on this call you are part of the unlucky group that is being laid off,” he said. “Your employment here is terminated effective immediately.”\\n\\nVideos of the incident record the immediate reaction of those people on the receiving end of those fateful words. Use your imagination, but people weren’t happy. When I first saw this video, I had *some* empathy for the CEO. I’ve been in that position and I’ve terminated people before. Frankly, I’ve even said words very close to the words he has used. But something seemed off. So I pulled in the big guns on this and requested some insight from *Radical Candor* author Kim Scott. Here’s what she had to say: \\n  \\n ”*[When I've had to do layoffs I always blame myself--I hired too fast / didn't anticipate changes in the market. I never, ever say I'm laying folks off b/c they did something wrong. To make a layoff about the performance of the people one's firing is not to take accountability.](https://twitter.com/kimballscott/status/1468633990567718913)”*\\n\\nSince the debacle of the firing and the media firestorm that followed, [the CEO has since apologized.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/08/business/better-zoom-layoffs-vishal-garg.html?utm_campaign=Mission%20%26%20Margin%3A%20How%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Soul%20While%20Leading%20with%20Excellence&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)\\n\\n> *The chief executive of the mortgage lender Better.com has apologized for the way he laid off about 900 employees over Zoom last week, saying that he “blundered the execution.”*\\n\\n> *In a letter to employees dated Tuesday, the executive, Vishal Garg, wrote that he failed to show the “appropriate amount of respect and appreciation” for those who were laid off. “In doing so, I embarrassed you,” he wrote in the letter, which was published on [Better.com’s website](https://cdn.brandfolder.io/A8SA0YBW/at/ggkbfpsbjbvc335cprpv33bg/A_Message_From_Our_Founder___CEO.pdf?utm_campaign=Mission%20%26%20Margin%3A%20How%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Soul%20While%20Leading%20with%20Excellence&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter).*\\n\\nIt still appears the CEO is more concerned with the embarrassment he himself received in this situation, rather than following the wisdom of Kim Scott in blaming himself. In fact, he anonymously dug in and continued the blame game according to the New York Times.\\n\\nThe reality, however, was he needed to own the mistakes.\\n\\n*HE* didn’t anticipate changes in the market.\\n\\n*HE* hired people way too quickly.\\n\\nBut we haven’t heard these things happening, often because the ego of the leader gets in the way of just owning their mistake and moving on (which by the way, is a [topic discussed in the 3rd episode of the Mission & Margin Podcast with former Gerber VP Bob Bennet](https://www.missionandmargin.co/episodes/episode-03-bob-bennett?utm_campaign=Mission%20%26%20Margin%3A%20How%20to%20Keep%20Your%20Soul%20While%20Leading%20with%20Excellence&utm_medium=email&utm_source=Revue%20newsletter)).\\n\\nSo when the time comes to fire someone?\\n\\n* Never make the layoff about someone’s performance\\n* Take accountability (hired too fast/didn’t anticipate the market)\\n* Don’t do it on Zoom\\n\\nWhat else do you think can be learned by this situation?
