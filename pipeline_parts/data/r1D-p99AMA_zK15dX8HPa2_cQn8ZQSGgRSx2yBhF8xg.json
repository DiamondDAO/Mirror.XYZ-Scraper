"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There are well-known artists and IPs with their own traffic to participate in the production or launch. The design is exquisite and the concept is rich. The most important thing is: let people be willing to replace this NFT with their own avatar; second, the herd effect driven by celebrities and big coffees is very important. Punk and Ape have a large number of crypto industry big celebrities and celebrities participating, and the avatar is Ads with the highest frequency; third, there is a money-making effect, investors participate in frequent transactions, and there is room for profit from them. Now some NFT investment communities have been formed.\\n\\nRegarding the future of avatar NFTs, it is still too early to talk about the meta universe, and social media is the main battlefield of avatar NFTs. Therefore, the NFT verification function announced by Twitter is very critical:\\n\\n\\\"Twitter Spaces software engineer Mada Aflak publicly showed a quick demo. In the streaming video, users can click on their avatar, select an NFT from their encrypted wallet, and download the NFT from OpenSea (a popular digital collectibles market) , You can put this NFT image into their avatar, and then a \\\"blue mark\\\" will be automatically generated on Twitter's profile to indicate that they are the true owner of this NFT image. \\\"\\n\\nIn the future, if giant social software such as Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Telegram, etc., all add this function, even Chinese social software such as Weibo, WeChat, Dingding, etc. will also add this function (of course, it is more likely to use its own alliance chain instead of the public chain. ), then the avatar-like NFT may usher in a big explosion.\\n\\nOf course, this is just a beautiful vision. The biggest difficulty faced by avatar NFTs is whether it is too limited to a small circle and eventually shrinks slowly.\",\"timestamp\":1634222137,\"title\":\"What kind of NFT is easy to succeed?\"},\"digest\":\"xqxBdjKGXSL-8Y5LTpWqenVzNmcOk1__fa8WMbFMOZE\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xa7A74628446F158CB4Ae4D9e052d351baE487b11\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XFJZnxmJ_N7anBeVdS36m956fvb2whCCtx8JU9TniJ4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"R6QLqcInzarFXeW6AIFda2g8EYLR2FaZyK6GHsrgths\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"4O2XFxRtXlntLJ8ggRQPtfxByeEfIbwnlIzeVdt0FgzDte6GaeT2giXyX4i6EfGSX5W38r7G7AsKnwnnNJGLWg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x8a5174b6cbf8fa1c1ded258a2ac3db558cfc99f7142f9e48816727d9eafcb6554a91d293f15d651a67d82fd553da932561877034fc848c27c1841083def1009d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"XFJZnxmJ_N7anBeVdS36m956fvb2whCCtx8JU9TniJ4\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"R6QLqcInzarFXeW6AIFda2g8EYLR2FaZyK6GHsrgths\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"xqxBdjKGXSL-8Y5LTpWqenVzNmcOk1__fa8WMbFMOZE\"}"
