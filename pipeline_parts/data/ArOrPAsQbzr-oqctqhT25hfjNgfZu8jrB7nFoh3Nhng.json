"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"My morning routine is wake up > make coffee > grab an analog version of the WSJ > read news + drink coffee. It’s simple and starts my day right. I love learning what’s happening in the world, but don’t feel connected unless I’m engaged. \\n\\nIf something peaks my interest, I Google the companies I read about to see how they compare to others, explore their team, review their careers page and sometime invest (if public). All this engagement is passive. I’ve never felt as if I’m a part of these companies. I’m just another customer or shareholder in a private transactional model.\\n\\nExploring DeFi and web3 apps, I don’t feel like I’m just another transaction. I’m on a journey with other early explorers who are on a quest to learn while doing. The paradigm shift from passive to active engagement with companies will be revolutionary. Vive la résistance!\\n\\nYesterday I…\\n\\n* **High Gas? Not on Polygon, OE, Celo**: The inefficiencies of Ethereum become crystal clear after swapping tokens on Layer 2 (Sushiswap, Ubeswap, Quickswap) and bridging them back to the ETH Mainnet. Unlocking this knowledge should save me hundreds in ETH gas. \\n* **Wolf like me**: I aped in and purchased two land deeds for \\\\~$1700 USD. I listed both for 1 ETH on OpenSea (I haven’t sold anything on OpenSea yet). The floor spiked and crashed a few times. This will be a rollercoaster. \\n* **Hopping in the pool**: I added USDT, CUSD & USDC to pools on PoolTogether. Putting my small = better strategy into effect to be part of these pools without much financial impact. \\n* **Liquidity pools = profit?:** $SAND is up 40% in the past 24 hours. The $4k USD I pooled as [SAND / ETH](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool/156944) was is now worth $4800 and has created $140 in fees. I want to do more of these pools on Polygon to avoid gas. \\n* **Hardware in my pocket?**: Do I need a hardware wallet? It seems like the $70 USD spent on a Nano S would be money well spent. I don’t want to get scammed again.\",\"timestamp\":1637674440,\"title\":\"Learning by doing\"},\"digest\":\"1GmGnZx3-XruRHw1fO1rUxcUmRGGx34xFHj0OcNb1cs\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5dC70A9b884f78Ee030a8c6ad3b3b7dc10Bbe7f4\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8bFS5AolGoJl-KAHMW1dyupWTPS1abgyLQmDLtXc1to\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"82_HvAiUqvP21CKtIP5jDpkaptQz3n9FEwPIN_mD7GU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"aiogXs-7JnOaMF2FPPg8AOZPUmek7amy0yGtSj5tb3kWbWOJusLyyLcwG6WuQtmqo3FasAQ5hjBtI8u-Jd7TgA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0xc1c9c717edeb314c42f37743b068aa7c80538baf081d8d17b694f0591c489d3b0782328ca0161265e84e9e0a0cfffb1815286eede79ca5b78bfb3df85b77d4611b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8bFS5AolGoJl-KAHMW1dyupWTPS1abgyLQmDLtXc1to\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"82_HvAiUqvP21CKtIP5jDpkaptQz3n9FEwPIN_mD7GU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"1GmGnZx3-XruRHw1fO1rUxcUmRGGx34xFHj0OcNb1cs\"}"
