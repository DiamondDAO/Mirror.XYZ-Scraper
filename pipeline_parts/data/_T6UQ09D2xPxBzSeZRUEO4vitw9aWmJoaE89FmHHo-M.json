"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Opensea : The largest NFT market place by volume.\\n\\nWe all have learned that web3 is about decentralization and permission less. But still we are at the mercy of NFT platforms.\\n\\nLet’s check out some cases :\\n\\n*   OpenSea has banned the PHAYC and Phunky Ape Yacht Club (or PAYC) collections, both of which are based on the same gimmick: selling NFTs with mirrored but otherwise identical versions of high-priced Bored Ape Yacht Club avatars.\\n*   OpenSea has frozen $2.2 million worth of BAYC NFTs. ( I don’t appreciate stealing activities but we are talking about decentralization )\\n*   [Insider trading](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/sep/16/nft-trader-opensea-bans-insider-trading-after-employee-rakes-in-profit)\\n*   OpenSea delists DAO Turtles project citing financialization concerns\\n*   Political Cartoonist Accuses NFT Platforms Opensea, Rarible of Being 'Tools for Political Censorship'\\n*   “We automatically block addresses on the U.S. sanctions list from buying, selling, or transferring on OpenSea,” a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “Nobody was able to transact with these NFTs once the addresses were added to the sanctions list. As an additional measure, the items and accounts are no longer visible on OpenSea.\\\"\\n\\nThese cases tell us that we need a truly decentralized marketplace. And it seems that many startups are working on it. Future is permission less.\\n\\nThank you for reading.
