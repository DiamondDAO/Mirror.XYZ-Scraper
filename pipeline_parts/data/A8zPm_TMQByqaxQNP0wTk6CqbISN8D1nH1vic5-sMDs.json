"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I came to Chennai from Pondicherry in 1999. One of the things I was excited about\\nwhen I came to the city was the Marina beach. I've heard so much about it and\\nthought I'd get to go there as often as I visited the Rock beach when I was in Pondy.\\nBut, I lost access to the beach after coming to Chennai. To get to the beach we had\\nto take a back-breaking bus ride that lasted two hours in traffic. Until 2015, l\\nwould've visited the beach maybe four times. And, I didn't see the Besant Nagar\\nbeach until 2010. \\n \\nBut, my car changed it all. After getting my car in 2015, I visited the beach almost\\nevery weekend. For a brief period in my life, the only weekend plan I had was to visit\\nthe beach, stop at a restaurant on the way back and have a hot plate of Pongal\\nvada for breakfast, come back home and sleep until I was hungry again. Beach\\nvisits made my weekends more pleasant. \\n \\nWhen I got married, I was drawn towards Rock beach once again as my wife is from\\nPondy. Every time I visit my in-laws, I wake up early in the morning and go sit at\\nRock beach reminiscing my childhood. \\n \\nOne of the things I love about beaches is nobody judges what you do at the beach\\nYou can dig a huge hole in the ground. Build a sandcastle. Chase crabs. Run\\nbackward from the incoming waves. Do sirasasana. Join random strangers and\\nlaugh your lungs out. Or even walk upside-down! \\n \\nBeach lets you be yourself. \\n \\nFor some reason, the society that judges your every move ignores you at the beach.\\nBeach is a judgment-free zone. \\n \\nI once went to a beach party where a fluorescent board at the open bar said \\\"Life is\\na beach\\\". I thought '*Life is like a beach. It is beautiful, calming despite the crashing\\nwaves of constant sorrows and challenges, and you get to be yourself without\\nworrying about what the others are thinking.*' \\n \\nBut are we being ourselves?\",\"timestamp\":1637797666,\"title\":\"#18 Beach Lets You Be Yourself\"},\"digest\":\"tMVFgsnLXOa4gO5lAGQsxix2T1lG-35U11Fyv-O9f8U\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x5F882566e4B071Ec1565Ed633EDBFB5c902dCA74\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8_uGVGdfFjLSJWYd0zMXytofzonHacRrnRv2eKJFt2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ZD7ifRsXTRvXXBU3V2IkPZAMDhECIUxIelNusRyYms\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"hZUligc5qesX3CVC5obPbmWHh1XZaVjhLzylTdr0Tp0PSqhq2ZkaVfUj8TjGWKHVex29gMZo3g6dZlXyBHBBOQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x5dad564490ee162511d60b533a5ad5d7949efface30fb34d4338a146b02755d9025af55c5b65bcd4dbc7213a59304f21b2e17848f3ef96f5b0b359f3399243151c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"8_uGVGdfFjLSJWYd0zMXytofzonHacRrnRv2eKJFt2Y\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"_ZD7ifRsXTRvXXBU3V2IkPZAMDhECIUxIelNusRyYms\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"tMVFgsnLXOa4gO5lAGQsxix2T1lG-35U11Fyv-O9f8U\"}"
