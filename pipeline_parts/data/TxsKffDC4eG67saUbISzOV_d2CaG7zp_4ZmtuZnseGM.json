"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"We're super excited to launch the crowdfund for Impossible Object's first book, *Conversations on AI*.\\n\\n~~If you'd like to back this project, all you need is an Ethereum address and to click on the Crowdfund block below.~~ Detailed instructions about both can be found later in this post.\\n\\n[CROWDFUND BLOCK]\\n\\nImpossible Object books exist at the intersection of crypto and legacy publishing. This means we'll be publishing innovative books the old-fashioned way, as trade paperbacks and eBooks, but we're also attempting something completely new: simultaneously releasing on-chain so that we can use crypto's capacities to help make new kinds of book.\\n\\n*Conversations on AI* will be the first result of this experiment. Crypto has already provided solutions for crowdfunding [fiction](https://emily.mirror.xyz/0AFENlMKv9amUC1OJIZY26udpISw_raXkoEcvelPvzg), [science](https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/41443491289334730858714141368268395642829177615924976808738423867555824271361) and [music](https://songcamp.mirror.xyz/xVIye95frUFrZ4RbfYPFNhfi1emI7kvXCcxJOTbcBlM); now it's philosophy's turn. Backers of $IMPOSSIBLE will see the first ever philosophy book funded by crypto brought into the world.\\n\\n## Who's contributing to the book – and why AI?\\n\\nThe initial impetus for the project was to:\\n\\n- Gather together a group of pioneering thinkers so they could discuss a topic that all of their work has a stake in.\\n\\n- Transcribe, edit and publish their discussions as a public good.\\n\\nThat group ended up comprising Reza Negarestani, Benjamin Bratton, Mat Dryhurst, Holly Herndon, Helen Hester and Nick Srnicek.
