"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"\\\"I arrived this morning. It was hot travelling, and I shared my compartment in the wagon-lit with a German gentleman very far advanced in several unaesthetic ailments. Basta! Thank Heaven for this. Calm and delicious!\\\"\\n\\nHis large, piercing eyes were fixed upon Vere.\\n\\n\\\"And about twelve,\\\" he added, \\\"or twelve-and-a-half.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, you. I am not speaking of myself, though I believe I am calm also.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I am a woman--practically.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Practically?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes; isn't that the word people always put in when they mean 'that's a lie'?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You mean you aren't a woman! This afternoon I must agree with you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's the sea! But just now, when you were coming, I was looking at myself in the glass and saying, 'You're a woman'--solemnly, you know, as if it was a dreadful truth.\\\"\\n\\nArtois had sat down on a sofa. He leaned back now with his hands behind his head. He still looked at Vere, and, as he did so, he heard the faint whisper of the sea.\\n\\n\\\"Child of nature,\\\" he said--\\\"call yourself that. It covers any age, and it's blessedly true.\\\"\\n\\nGiulia came in at this moment with tea. She smiled again broadly on Artois, and received and returned his greeting with the comfortable and unembarrassed friendliness of the Italian race. As she went out she was still smiling.\\n\\n\\\"Addio to the German gentleman with the unaesthetic ailments!\\\" said Artois.\\n\\nAn almost boyish sensation of sheer happiness invaded him. It made him feel splendidly, untalkative. And he felt for a moment, too, as if his intellect lay down to sleep.\\n\\n\\\"Cara Giulia!\\\" he added, after a rapturous silence.\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Carissima Giulia!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, Giulia is--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"They all are, and the island, and the house upon it, and this clear yellow tea, and this brown toast, and this butter from Lombardy. They all are.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I believe you are feeling good all over, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"San Gennaro knows I am.\\\"\\n\\nHe drank some tea, and ate some toast, spreading the butter upon it with voluptuous deliberation.\\n\\n\\\"Then I'm sure he's pleased.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Paris, hateful Paris!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but that's abusive. A person who feels good all over should not say that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You are right, Vere. But when are you not right? You ought always to wear your hair down, mon enfant, and always to have just been bathing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you ought always to have just been travelling.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It is true that a dreadful past can be a blessing as well as a curse. It is profoundly true. Why have I never realized that before?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If I am twelve and a half, I think you are about--about--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"For the love of the sea make it under twenty, Vere.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Nineteen, then.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Were you going to make it under twenty?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I was.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe you. Yes, I do, I do! You are an artist. You realize that truth is a question of feeling, not a question of fact. You penetrate beneath the gray hairs as the prosaic never do. This butter is delicious! And to think that there have been moments when I have feared butter, when I have kept an eye upon a corpulent future. Give me some more, plenty more.\\\"\\n\\nVere stretched out her hand to the tea-table, but it shook. She drew it back, and burst into a peal of laughter.\\n\\n\\\"What are you laughing at?\\\" said Artois, with burlesque majesty.\\n\\n\\\"At you. What's the matter with you, Monsieur Emile? How can you be so foolish?\\\"\\n\\nShe lay back in her chair, with her hair streaming about her, and her thin body quivered, as if the sense of fun within her were striving to break through its prison walls.\\n\\n\\\"This,\\\" said Artois, \\\"this is sheer impertinence. I venture to inquire for butter, and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"To inquire! One, two, three, four--five pats of butter right in front of you! And you inquire--!\\\"\\n\\nArtois suddenly sent out a loud roar to join her childish treble.\\n\\nThe tea had swept away his previous sensation of fatigue, even the happy stolidity that had succeeded it for an instant. He felt full of life and gayety, and a challenging mental activity. A similar challenging activity, he thought, shone in the eyes of the girl opposite to him.\\n\\n\\\"Thank God I can still be foolish!\\\" he exclaimed. \\\"And thank God that there are people in the world devoid of humor. My German friend was without humor. Only that fact enabled me to endure his prodigious collection of ailments. But for the heat I might even have revelled in them. He was asthmatic, without humor; dyspeptic, without humor. He had a bad cold in the head, without humor, and got up into the top berth with two rheumatic legs and a crick in the back, without humor. Had he seen the fun of himself, the fun would have meant much less to me.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You cruel person!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is often cruelty in humor--perhaps not in yours, though, yet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why do you say--yet, like that?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The hair is such a kindly veil that I doubt the existence of cruelty behind it.\\\"\\n\\nHe spoke with a sort of almost tender and paternal gentleness.\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe you could ever be really cruel, Monsieur Emile.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think you are too intelligent.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why should that prevent me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Isn't cruelty stupid, unimaginative?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Often. But it can be brilliant, artful, intellectual, full of imagination. It can be religious. It can be passionate. It can be splendid. It can be almost everything.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Splendid!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Like Napoleon's cruelty to France. But why should I educate you in abominable knowledge?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh,\\\" said the girl, thrusting forward her firm little chin, \\\"I have no faith in mere ignorance.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yet it does a great deal for those who are not ignorant.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It shows them how pretty, how beautiful even, sometimes, was the place from which they started for their journey through the world.\\\"\\n\\nVere was silent for a moment. The sparkle of fun had died out of her eyes, which had become dark with the steadier fires of imagination. The strands of her thick hair, falling down on each side of her oval face, gave to it a whimsically mediaeval look, suggestive of legend. Her long-fingered, delicate, but strong little hands were clasped in her lap, and did not move. It was evident that she was thinking deeply.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I know,\\\" she said, at last. \\\"Yes, that was my thought, or almost.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"When?\\\"\\n\\nShe hesitated, looking at him, not altogether doubtfully, but with a shadow of reserve, which might easily, he fancied, grow deeper, or fade entirely away. He saw the resolve to speak come quietly into her mind.\\n\\n\\\"You know, Monsieur Emile, I love watching the sea,\\\" she said, rather slowly and carefully. \\\"Especially at dawn, and in the evening before it is dark. And it always seems to me as if at dawn it is more heavenly than it is after the day has happened, though it is so very lovely then. And sometimes that has made me feel that our dawn is our most beautiful time--as if we were nearest the truth then. And, of course, that is when we are most ignorant, isn't it? So I suppose I have been thinking a little bit like you. Haven't I?\\\"\\n\\nShe asked it earnestly. Artois had never heard her speak quite like this before, with a curious deliberation that was nevertheless without self-consciousness. Before he could answer she added, abruptly, as if correcting, or even almost condemning herself:\\n\\n\\\"I can put it much better than that. I have.\\\"\\n\\nArtois leaned forward. Something, he did not quite know what, made him feel suddenly a deep interest in what Vere said--a strong curiosity even.\\n\\n\\\"You have put it much better?\\\" he said.\\n\\nVere suddenly looked conscious. A faint wave of red went over her face and down to her small neck. Her hands moved and parted. She seemed half ashamed of something for a minute.\\n\\n\\\"Madre doesn't know,\\\" she murmured, as if she were giving him a reason for something. \\\"It isn't interesting,\\\" she added. \\\"Except, of course, to me.\\\"\\n\\nArtois was watching her.\\n\\n\\\"I think you really want to tell me,\\\" he said now.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes, in a way I do. I have been half wanting to for a long time-- but only half.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And now?\\\"\\n\\nShe looked at him, but almost instantly looked down again, with a sort of shyness he had never seen in her before. And her eyes had been full of a strange and beautiful sensitiveness.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind, Vere,\\\" he said quickly, obedient to those eyes, and responding to their delicate subtlety. \\\"We all have our righteous secrets, and should all respect the righteous secrets of others.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I think we should. And I know you would be the very last, at least Madre and you, to--I think I'm being rather absurd, really.\\\" The last words were said with a sudden change of tone to determination, as if Vere were taking herself to task. \\\"I'm making a lot of almost nothing. You see, if I am a woman, as Gaspare is making out, I'm at any rate a very young one, am I not?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The youngest that exists.\\\"\\n\\nAs he said that Artois thought, \\\"Mon Dieu! If the Marchesino could only see her now!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If humor is cruel, Monsieur Emile,\\\" Vere continued, \\\"you will laugh at me. For I am sure, if I tell you--and I know now I'm going to--you will think this fuss is as ridiculous as the German's cold in the head, and poor legs, and all. I wrote that about the sea.\\\"\\n\\nShe said the last sentence with a sort of childish defiance.\\n\\n\\\"Wait,\\\" said Artois. \\\"Now I begin to understand.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"All those hours spent in your room. Your mother thought you were reading.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No,\\\" she said, still rather defiantly; \\\"I've been writing that, and other things--about the sea.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How? In prose?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. That's the worst of it, I suppose.\\\"\\n\\nAnd again the faint wave of color went over her face to her neck.\\n\\n\\\"Do you really feel so criminal? Then what ought I to feel?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You? Now that is really cruel!\\\" she cried, getting up quickly, almost as if she meant to hurry away.\\n\\nBut she only stood there in front of him, near the window.\\n\\n\\\"Never mind!\\\" she said. \\\"Only you remember that Madre tried. She had never said much about it to me. But now and then from just a word I know that she feels bad, that she wishes very much she could do something. Only the other day she said to me, 'We have the instinct, men the vocabulary.' She was meaning that you had. She even told me to ask you something that I had asked her, and she said, 'I feel all the things that he can explain.' And there was something in her voice that hurt me--for her. And Madre is so clever. Isn't she clever?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And if Madre can't do things, you can imagine that I feel rather absurd now that I'm telling you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, being just as you are, Vere, I can quite imagine that you do. But we can have sweet feelings of absurdity that only arise from something moral within us, a moral delicacy. However, would you like me to look at what you have been writing about the sea?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, if you can do it quite seriously.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could not do it in any other way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Then--thank you.\\\"\\n\\nShe went out of the room, not without a sort of simple dignity that was utterly removed from conceit or pretentiousness.\\n\\nWhat a strange end, this, to their laughter!\\n\\nVere was away several minutes, during which at first Artois sat quite still, leaning back, with his great frame stretched out, and his hands once more behind his head. His intellect was certainly very much awake now, and he was setting a guard upon it, to watch it carefully, lest it should be ruthless, even with Vere. And was he not setting also another guard to watch the softness of his nature, lest it should betray him into foolish kindness?\\n\\nYet, after a minute, he said to himself that he was wasting his time in both these proceedings. For Vere's eyes were surely a touchstone to discover honesty. There is something merciless in the purity of untarnished youth. What can it not divine at moments?\\n\\nArtois poured out another cup of tea and drank it, considering the little funny situation. Vere and he with a secret from Hermione shared between them! Vere submitting verses to his judgment! He remembered Hermione's half-concealed tragedy, which, of course, had been patent to him in its uttermost nakedness. Even Vere had guessed something of it. Do we ever really hide anything from every one? And yet each one breathes mystery too. The assertive man is the last of fools. Of that at least Artois just then felt certain.\\n\\nIf Vere should really have talent! He did not expect it, although he had said that there was intellectual force in the girl. There was intellectual force in Hermione, but she could not create. And Vere! He smiled as he thought of her rush into the room with her hair streaming down, of her shrieks of laughter over his absurdity. But she was full of changes.\\n\\nThe door opened, and Vere came in holding some manuscript in her hand. She had done up her hair while she had been away. When Artois saw that he heaved himself up from the sofa.\\n\\n\\\"I must smoke,\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Oh yes. I'll get the Khali Targas.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No. I must have a pipe. And you prefer that, I know.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Generally, but--you do look dreadfully as if you meant business when you are smoking a pipe.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I do mean business now.\\\"\\n\\nHe took his pipe from his pocket, filled it and lit it.\\n\\n\\\"Now then, Vere!\\\" he said.\\n\\nShe came to sit down on the sofa.\\n\\nHe sat down beside her.\\n\\nCHAPTER XII\\n\\nMore than an hour had passed. To Vere it had seemed like five minutes. Her cheeks were hotly flushed. Her eyes shone. With hands that were slightly trembling she gathered together her manuscripts, and carefully arranged them in a neat packet and put a piece of ribbon round them, tying it in a little bow. Meanwhile Artois, standing up, was knocking the shreds of tobacco out of his pipe against the chimney-piece into his hand. He carried them over to the window, dropped them out, then stood for a minute looking at the sea.\\n\\n\\\"The evening calm is coming, Vere,\\\" he said, \\\"bringing with it the wonder of this world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\nHe heard a soft sigh behind him, and turned round.\\n\\n\\\"Why was that? Has dejection set in, then?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, no.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You know the Latin saying: 'Festina lente'? If you want to understand how slowly you must hasten, look at me.\\\"\\n\\nHe had been going to add, \\\"Look at these gray hairs,\\\" but he did not. Just then he felt suddenly an invincible reluctance to call Vere's attention to the signs of age apparent in him.\\n\\n\\\"I spoke to you about the admirable incentive of ambition,\\\" he continued, after a moment. \\\"But you must understand that I meant the ambition for perfection, not at all the ambition for celebrity. The satisfaction of the former may be a deep and exquisite joy--the partial satisfaction, for I suppose it can never be anything more than that. But the satisfaction of the other will certainly be Dead-sea fruit--fruit of the sea unlike that brought up by Ruffo, without lasting savor, without any real value. One should never live for that.\\\"\\n\\nThe last words he spoke as if to himself, almost like a warning addressed to himself.\\n\\n\\\"I don't believe I ever should,\\\" Vere said quickly. \\\"I never thought of such a thing.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The thought will come, though, inevitably.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"How dreadful it must be to know so much about human nature as you do!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And yet how little I really know!\\\"\\n\\nThere came up a distant cry from the sea. Vere started.\\n\\n\\\"There is Madre! Of course, Monsieur Emile, I don't want--but you understand!\\\"\\n\\nShe hurried out of the room, carrying the packet with her.\\n\\nArtois felt that the girl was strongly excited. She was revealing more of herself to him, this little Vere whom he had known, and not known, ever since she had been a baby. The gradual revelation interested him intensely--so intensely that in him, too, there was excitement now. So many truths go to make up the whole round truth of every human soul. Hermione saw some of these truths of Vere, Gaspare others, perhaps; he again others. And even Ruffo and the Marchesino--he put the Marchesino most definitely last--even they saw still other truths of Vere, he supposed.\\n\\nTo whom did she reveal the most? The mother ought to know most, and during the years of childhood had doubtless known most. But those years were nearly over. Certainly Vere was approaching, or was on, the threshold of the second period of her life.\\n\\nAnd she and he had a secret from Hermione. This secret was a very innocent one. Still, of course, it had the two attributes that belong to every secret: of drawing together those who share it, of setting apart from them those who know it not. And there was another secret, too, connected with it, and known only to Artois: the fact that the child, Vere, possessed the very small but quite definite beginnings, the seed, as it were, of something that had been denied to the mother, Hermione.\\n\\n\\\"Emile, you have come back! I am glad!\\\"\\n\\nHermione came into the room with her eager manner and rather slow gait, holding out both her hands, her hot face and prominent eyes showing forth with ardor the sincerity of her surprise and pleasure.\\n\\n\\\"Gaspare told me. I nearly gave him a hug. You know his sly look when he has something delightful up his sleeve for one! Bless you!\\\"\\n\\nShe shook both his hands.\\n\\n\\\"And I had come back in such bad spirits! But now--\\\"\\n\\nShe took off her hat and put it on a table.\\n\\n\\\"Why were you in bad spirits, my friend?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I had been with Madame Alliani, seeing something of the intense misery and wickedness of Naples. I have seen a girl--such a tragedy! What devils men can be in these Southern places! What hideous things they will do under the pretence of being driven by love! But--no, don't let us spoil your arrival. Where is Vere? I thought she was entertaining you.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We have been having tea together. She has this moment gone out of the room.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh!\\\"\\n\\nShe seemed to expect some further explanation. As he gave none she sat down.\\n\\n\\\"Wasn't she very surprised to see you?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think she was. She had just been bathing, and came running in with her hair all about her, looking like an Undine with a dash of Sicilian blood in her. Here she is!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Are you pleased, Madre? You poor, hot Madre!\\\"\\n\\nVere sat down by her mother and put one arm round her. Subtly she was trying to make up to her mother for the little secret she was keeping from her for a time.\\n\\n\\\"Are you very, very pleased?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes, I think I am.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Think! You mischievous Madre!\\\"\\n\\nHermione laughed.\\n\\n\\\"But I feel almost jealous of you two sitting here in the cool, and having a quiet tea and a lovely talk while-- Never mind. Here is my tea. And there's another thing. Oh, Emile, I do wish I had known you would arrive to-day!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why specially?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I've committed an unusual crime. I've made--actually--an engagement for this evening.\\\"\\n\\nArtois and Vere held up their hands in exaggerated surprise.\\n\\n\\\"Are you mad, my dear Hermione?\\\" asked Artois.\\n\\n\\\"I believe I am. It's dangerous to go to Naples. I met a young man.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The Marchesino!\\\" cried Vere. \\\"The Marchesino! I see him in your eye, Madre.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"C'est cela!\\\" said Artois, \\\"and you mean to say--!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That I accepted an invitation to dine with him to-night, at nine, at the Scoglio di Frisio. There! Why did I? I have no idea. I was hot from a horrible vicolo. He was cool from the sea. What chance had I against him? And then he is through and through Neapolitan, and gives no quarter to a woman, even when she is 'una vecchia.' \\\"\\n\\nAs she finished Hermione broke into a laugh, evidently at some recollection.\\n\\n\\\"Doro made his eyes very round. I can see that,\\\" said Artois.\\n\\n\\\"Like this!\\\" cried Vere.\\n\\nAnd suddenly there appeared in her face a reminiscence of the face of the Marchesino.\\n\\n\\\"Vere, you must not! Some day you will do it by accident when he is here.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Is he coming here?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"In a launch to fetch me--us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Am I invited?\\\" said Vere. \\\"What fun!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I could not get out of it,\\\" Hermione said to Artois. \\\"But now I insist on your staying here till the Marchesino comes. Then he will ask you, and we shall be a quartet.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I will stay,\\\" said Artois, with a sudden return of his authoritative manner.\\n\\n\\\"It seems that I am woefully ignorant of the Bay,\\\" continued Hermione. \\\"I have never dined at Frisio's. Everybody goes there at least once. Everybody has been there. Emperors, kings, queens, writers, singers, politicians, generals--they all eat fish at Frisio's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It's true.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have done it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes. The Padrone is worth knowing. He--but to-night you will know him. Yes, Frisio's is characteristic. Vere will be amused.\\\"\\n\\nWith a light tone he hid a faint chagrin.\\n\\n\\\"What fun!\\\" repeated Vere. \\\"If I had diamonds I should put them on.\\\"\\n\\nShe too was hiding something, one sentiment with another very different. But her youth came to her aid, and very soon the second excitement really took the place of the first, and she was joyously alive to the prospect of a novel gayety.\\n\\n\\\"I must not eat anything more,\\\" said Hermione. \\\"I believe the Marchesino is ordering something marvellous for us, all the treasures of the sea. We must be up to the mark. He really is a good fellow.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Yes,\\\" said Artois. \\\"He is. I have a genuine liking for him.\\\"\\n\\nHe said it with obvious sincerity.\\n\\n\\\"I am going,\\\" said Vere. \\\"I must think about clothes. And I must undo my hair again and get Maria to dry it thoroughly, or I shall look frightening.\\\"\\n\\nShe went out quickly, her eyes sparkling.\\n\\n\\\"Vere is delighted,\\\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\\\"Yes, indeed she is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And you are not. Would you rather avoid the Marchesino to-night, Emile, and not come with us? Perhaps I am selfish. I would so very much rather have you with us.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If Doro asks me I shall certainly come. It's true that I wish you were not engaged to-night--I should have enjoyed a quiet evening here. But we shall have many quiet, happy evenings together this summer, I hope.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I wonder if we shall?\\\" said Hermione, slowly.\\n\\n\\\"You--why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. Oh, I am absurd, probably. One has such strange ideas, houses based on sand, or on air, or perhaps on nothing at all.\\\"\\n\\nShe got up, went to her writing-table, opened a drawer, and took out of it a letter.\\n\\n\\\"Emile,\\\" she said, coming back to him with it in her hand, \\\"would you like to explain this to me?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"The letter I found from you when I came back from Capri.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But does it need explanation?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It seemed to me as if it did. Read it and see.\\\"\\n\\nHe took it from her, opened it and read it.\\n\\n\\\"Well?\\\" he said.\\n\\n\\\"Isn't the real meaning between the lines?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If it is, cannot you decipher it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. I don't think so. Somehow it depressed me. Perhaps it was my mood just then. Was it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps it was merely mine.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But why--'I feel specially this summer I should like to be near you'? What does that mean exactly?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I did feel that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I don't think I can tell you now. I am not sure that I could even have told you at the time I wrote that letter.\\\"\\n\\nShe took it from him and put it away again in the drawer.\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps we shall both know later on,\\\" she said, quietly. \\\"I believe we shall.\\\"\\n\\nHe did not say anything.\\n\\n\\\"I saw that boy, Ruffo, this afternoon,\\\" she said, after a moment of silence.\\n\\n\\\"Did you?\\\" said Artois, with a change of tone, a greater animation. \\\"I forgot to ask Vere about him. I suppose he has been to the island again while I have been away?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Not once. Poor boy, I find he has been ill. He has had fever. He was out to-day for the first time after it. We met him close to Mergellina. He was in a boat, but he looked very thin and pulled down. He seemed so delighted to see me. I was quite touched.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hasn't Vere been wondering very much why he did not come again?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"She has never once mentioned him. Vere is a strange child sometimes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"But you--haven't you spoken of him to her?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"No, I don't think so.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere's silence made you silent?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I suppose so. I must tell her. She likes the boy very much.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it that attracts her to this boy, do you think?\\\"\\n\\nThe question was ordinary enough, but there was a peculiar intonation in Artois' voice as he asked it, an intonation that awakened surprise in Hermione.\\n\\n\\\"I don't know. He is an attractive boy.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You think so too?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Why, yes. What do you mean, Emile?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I was only wondering. The sea breeds a great many boys like Ruffo, you know. But they don't all get Khali Targa cigarettes given to them, for all that.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"That's true. I have never seen Vere pay any particular attention to the fishermen who come to the island. In a way she loves them all because they belong to the sea, she loves them as a décor. But Ruffo is different. I felt it myself.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Did you?\\\"\\n\\nHe looked at her, then looked out of the window and pulled his beard slowly.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. In my case, perhaps, the interest was roused partly by what Vere told me. The boy is a Sicilian, you see, and just Vere's age.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere's interest perhaps comes from the same reason.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Very likely it does.\\\"\\n\\nHermione spoke the last words without conviction. Perhaps they both felt that they were not talking very frankly--were not expressing their thoughts to each other with their accustomed sincerity. At any rate, Artois suddenly introduced another topic of conversation, the reason of his hurried visit to Paris, and for the next hour they discussed literary affairs with a gradually increasing vivacity and open- heartedness. The little difficulty between them--of which both had been sensitive and fully conscious--passed away, and when at length Hermione got up to go to her bedroom and change her dress for the evening, there was no cloud about them.\\n\\nWhen Hermione had gone Artois took up a book, but he sat till the evening was falling and Giulia came smiling to light the lamp, without reading a word of it. Her entry roused him from his reverie, and he took out his watch. It was already past eight. The Marchesino would soon be coming. And then--the dinner at Frisio's!\\n\\nHe got up and moved about the room, picking up a book here and there, glancing at some pages, then putting it down. He felt restless and uneasy.\\n\\n\\\"I am tired from the journey,\\\" he thought. \\\"Or--I wonder what the weather is this evening. The heat seems to have become suffocating since Hermione went away.\\\"\\n\\nHe went to one of the windows and looked out. Twilight was stealing over the sea, which was so calm that it resembled a huge sheet of steel. The sky over the island was clear. He turned and went to the opposite window. Above Ischia there was a great blackness like a pall. He stood looking at it for some minutes. His erring thoughts, which wandered like things fatigued that cannot rest, went to a mountain village in Sicily, through which he had once ridden at night during a terrific thunder-storm. In a sudden, fierce glare of lightning he had seen upon the great door of a gaunt Palazzo, which looked abandoned, a strip of black cloth. Above it were the words, \\\"Lutto in famiglia.\\\"\\n\\nThat was years ago. Yet now he saw again the palace door, the strip of cloth soaked by the pouring rain, the dreary, almost sinister words which he had read by lightning:\\n\\n\\\"Lutto in famiglia.\\\"\\n\\nHe repeated them as he gazed at the blackness above Ischia.\\n\\n\\\"Monsieur Emile!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Vere!\\\"\\n\\nThe girl came towards him, a white contrast to what he had been watching.\\n\\n\\\"I'm all ready. It seems so strange to be going out to a sort of party. I've had such a bother with my hair.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"You have conquered,\\\" he said. \\\"Undine has disappeared.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Come quite close to the lamp.\\\"\\n\\nShe came obediently.\\n\\n\\\"Vere transformed!\\\" he said. \\\"I have seen three Veres to-day already. How many more will greet me to-night?\\\"\\n\\nShe laughed gently, standing quite still. Her dress and her gloves were white, but she had on a small black hat, very French, and at the back of her hair there was a broad black ribbon tied in a big bow. This ribbon marked her exact age clearly, he thought.\\n\\n\\\"This is a new frock, and my very smartest,\\\" she said; \\\"and you dared to abuse Paris!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Being a man. I must retract now. You are right, we cannot do without it. But--have you an umbrella?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"An umbrella?\\\"\\n\\nShe moved and laughed again, much more gayly.\\n\\n\\\"I am serious. Come here and look at Ischia.\\\"\\n\\nShe went with him quickly to the window.\\n\\n\\\"That blackness does look wicked. But it's a long way off.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I think it is coming this way.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Oh, but\\\"--and she went to the opposite window--\\\"the sky is perfectly clear towards Naples. And look how still the sea is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Too still. It is like steel.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Hush! Listen!\\\"\\n\\nShe held up her hand. They both heard a far-off sound of busy panting on the sea.\\n\\n\\\"That must be the launch!\\\" she said.\\n\\nHer eyes were gay and expectant. It was evident that she was in high spirits, that she was looking forward to this unusual gayety.\\n\\n\\\"Yes.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Doesn't it sound in a hurry, as if the Marchesino was terribly afraid of being late?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Get your umbrella, Vere, and a waterproof. You will want them both.\\\"\\n\\nAt that moment Hermione came in.\\n\\n\\\"Madre, the launch is coming in a frightful hurry, and Monsieur Emile says we must take umbrellas.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Surely it isn't going to rain?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There is a thunder-storm coming up from Ischia, I believe,\\\" said Artois.\\n\\n\\\"Then we will take our cloaks in case. It is fearfully hot. I thought so when I was dressing. No doubt the launch will have a cabin.\\\"\\n\\nA siren hooted.\\n\\n\\\"That is the Marchesino saluting us!\\\" cried Vere. \\\"Come along, Madre! Maria! Maria!\\\"\\n\\nShe ran out, calling for the cloaks.\\n\\n\\\"Do you like Vere's frock, Emile?\\\" said Hermione, as they followed.\\n\\n\\\"Yes. She looks delicious--but quite like a little woman of the world.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Ah, you like her best as the Island child. So do I. Oh, Emile!\\\"\\n\\n\\\"What is it?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I can't help it. I hate Vere's growing up.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Few things can remain unchanged for long. This sea will be unrecognizable before we return.\\\"\\n\\nGaspare met them on the landing with solemn eyes.\\n\\n\\\"There is going to be a great storm, Signora,\\\" he said. \\\"It is coming from Ischia.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"So Don Emilio thinks. But we will take wraps, and we are going in a launch. It will be all right, Gaspare.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Shall I come with you, Signora?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Well, Gaspare, you see it is the Marchese's launch--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"If you would like me to come, I will ask the Signore Marchese.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"We'll see how much room there is.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Si, Signora.\\\"\\n\\nHe went down to receive the launch.\\n\\n\\\"Emile,\\\" Hermione said, as he disappeared, \\\"can you understand what a comfort to me Gaspare is? Ah, if people knew how women love those who are ready to protect them! It's quite absurd, but just because Gaspare said that, I'd fifty times rather have him with us than go without him.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"I understand. I love your watch-dog, too.\\\"\\n\\nShe touched his arm.\\n\\n\\\"No one could ever understand the merits of a watch-dog better than you. That's right, Maria; we shall be safer with these.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino stood at the foot of the cliff, bare-headed, to receive them. He was in evening dress, what he called \\\"smoking,\\\" with a flower in his button-hole, and a straw hat, and held a pair of white kid gloves in his hand. He looked in rapturous spirits, but ceremonial. When he caught sight of Artois on the steps behind Hermione and Vere, however, he could not repress an exclamation of \\\"Emilio!\\\"\\n\\nHe took Hermione's and Vere's hands, bowed over them and kissed them. Then he turned to his friend.\\n\\n\\\"Caro Emilio! You are back! You must come with us! You must dine at Frisio's.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"May I?\\\" said Artois.\\n\\n\\\"You must. This is delightful. See, Madame,\\\" he added to Hermione, suddenly breaking into awful French, \\\"we have the English flag! Your Jack! Voila, the great, the only Jack! I salute him! Let me help you!\\\"\\n\\nAs Hermione stepped into the launch she said:\\n\\n\\\"I see there is plenty of room. I wonder if you would mind my taking my servant, Gaspare, to look after the cloaks and umbrellas. It seems absurd, but he says a storm is coming, and--\\\"\\n\\n\\\"A storm!\\\" cried the Marchesino. \\\"Of course your Gaspare must come. Which is he?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"There.\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino spoke to Gaspare in Italian, telling him to join the two sailors in the stern of the launch. A minute afterwards he went to him and gave him some cigarettes. Then he brought from the cabin two bouquets of flowers, and offered them to Hermione and Vere, who, with Artois, were settling themselves in the bows. The siren sounded. They were off, cutting swiftly through the oily sea.\\n\\n\\\"A storm, Signora. Cloaks and umbrellas!\\\" said the Marchesino, shooting a glance of triumph at \\\"Cara Emilio,\\\" whose presence to witness his success completed his enjoyment of it. \\\"But it is a perfect night. Look at the sea. Signorina, let me put the cushion a little higher behind you. It is not right. You are not perfectly comfortable. And everything must be perfect for you to-night--everything.\\\" He arranged the cushion tenderly. \\\"The weather, too! Why, where is the storm?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Over Ischia,\\\" said Artois.\\n\\n\\\"It will stay there. Ischia! It is a volcano. Anything terrible may happen there.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"And Vesuvius?\\\" said Hermione, laughing.\\n\\nThe Marchesino threw up his chin.\\n\\n\\\"We are not going to Vesuvius. I know Naples, Signora, and I promise you fine weather. We shall take our coffee after dinner outside upon the terrace at the one and only Frisio's.\\\"\\n\\nHe chattered on gayly. His eyes were always on Vere, but he talked chiefly to Hermione, with the obvious intention of fascinating the mother in order that she might be favorably disposed towards him, and later on smile indulgently upon his flirtation with the daughter. His proceedings were carried on with a frankness that should have been disarming, and that evidently did disarm Hermione and Vere, who seemed to regard the Marchesino as a very lively boy. But Artois was almost immediately conscious of a secret irritation that threatened to spoil his evening.\\n\\nThe Marchesino was triumphant. Emilio had wished to prevent him from knowing these ladies. Why? Evidently because Emilio considered him dangerous. Now he knew the ladies. He was actually their host. And he meant to prove to Emilio how dangerous he could be. His eyes shot a lively defiance at his friend, then melted as they turned to Hermione, melted still more as they gazed with unwinking sentimentality into the eyes of Vere. He had no inward shyness to contend against, and was perfectly at his ease; and Artois perceived that his gayety and sheer animal spirits were communicating themselves to his companions. Vere said little, but she frequently laughed, and her face lit up with eager animation. And she, too, was quite at her ease. The direct, and desirous, glances of the Marchesino did not upset her innocent self- possession at all, although they began to upset the self-possession of Artois. As he sat, generally in silence, listening to the frivolous and cheerful chatter that never stopped, while the launch cut its way through the solemn, steel-like sea towards the lights of Posilipo. He felt that he was apart because he was clever, as if his cleverness caused loneliness.\\n\\nThey travelled fast. Soon the prow of the launch was directed to a darkness that lay below, and to the right of a line of brilliant lights that shone close to the sea; and a boy dressed in white, holding a swinging lantern, and standing, like a statue, in a small niche of rock almost flush with the water, hailed them, caught the gunwale of the launch with one hand, and brought it close in to the wall that towered above them.\\n\\n\\\"Do we get out here? But where do we go?\\\" said Hermione.\\n\\n\\\"There is a staircase. Let me--\\\"\\n\\nThe Marchesino was out in a moment and helped them all to land. He called to the sailors that he would send down food and wine to them and Gaspare. Then, piloted by the boy with the lantern, they walked up carefully through dark passages and over crumbling stairs, turned to the left, and came out upon a small terrace above the sea and facing the curving lamps of Naples. Just beyond was a long restaurant, lined with great windows on one side and with mirrors on the other, and blazing with light.\\n\\n\\\"Ecco!\\\" cried the Marchesino. \\\"Ecco lo Scoglio di Frisio! And here is the Padrone!\\\" he added, as a small, bright-eyed man, with a military figure and fierce mustaches, came briskly forward to receive them.\\n\\nCHAPTER XIII\\n\\nThe dinner, which was served at a table strewn with red carnations close to an open window, was a gay one, despite Artois. It could hardly have been otherwise with a host so complacent, so attentive, so self-possessed, so hilarious as the Marchesino. And the Padrone of the restaurant warmly seconded the efforts of the giver of the feast. He hovered perpetually, but always discreetly, near, watchfully directing the middle-aged waiters in their duties, smiling to show his teeth, stained with tobacco juice, or drawing delicately close to relate anecdotes connected with the menu.\\n\\nThe soup, a \\\"zuppa di pesce alla marinara\\\" remarkable for its beautiful red color, had been originally invented by the chef of Frisio's for the ex-Queen Natalie of Servia, who had deigned to come, heavily veiled, to lunch at the Scoglio, and had finally thrown off her veil and her incognito, and written her name in the visitors' book for all to see. The Macaroni a l'Imperatrice had been the favorite /plat/ of the dead Empress Elizabeth of Austria, who used to visit Frisio's day after day, and who always demanded two things--an eruption of Vesuvius and \\\"Funiculi, funicula!\\\" William Ewart Gladstone had deigned to praise the \\\"oeufs a la Gladstone,\\\" called henceforth by his name, when he walked over from the Villa Rendel to breakfast; and the delicious punch served before the dolce, and immediately after the \\\"Pollo panato alla Frisio,\\\" had been lauded by the late Czar of all the Russias, who was drinking a glass of it--according to the solemn asseveration of the Padrone--when the telegram announcing the assassination of his father was put into his hand.\",\"timestamp\":1637313757,\"title\":\"\\nHe sat down, rather heavily.\\n\\n\\\"You are tired.
