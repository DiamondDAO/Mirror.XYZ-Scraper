"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"Successful entrepreneurship, earning hundreds of millions, is actually quite simple.\\n\\n```\\nI have been thinking, what should we do first when we come into this world? Obviously observe the world and enjoy the world. Only if you observe the world carefully, you will discover something, and then you have to try to understand the world. Many people can't find the way to make money, they work hard all their lives, and they are still poor, but some people make money easily. It means that the degree of understanding of the world is different, and the angle is different.\\n\\nPeasant workers told their children that learning electric welding, learning excavators, and learning cooks can have a meal. This is how peasant workers understand the world. This kind of understanding is naturally difficult to make money.\\n```\\n\\nMany workers tell their children that they should study hard and take a good university entrance exam, and they can find a good job in the future. This kind of understanding will only become a housing slave-like working class, and it is naturally difficult to make money.\\n\\n```\\nPeople like us neither learn technology nor find a job well. They are focused on starting a business, only to be a business, only to be the boss, and never do other things. This way of understanding the world is better than the previous two. Breeders need to earn more, but it's not strong enough.\\n\\nI also made a few small bucks when I wrote programs, built websites, and started companies. We have an investor who invested hundreds of thousands at the beginning of the year, and made hundreds of thousands at the end of the year. He paid back his capital, and then he continued to receive dividends from the company. This investor does not visit the company all year long, and he has invested in dozens of such small businesses. He earns the most. Why did he make so much? It is because he understands the world differently.\\n\\nOn the road to making money and starting a business! How do you know the way you understand the world is wrong? The answer is very simple. If you have been working for half a year or a year, and you are still poor and haven't made any money, it means that there is a problem with the way you understand the world. You have to quickly learn new ways of understanding the world.\\n\\nThe result is the best tool to test whether your thinking is effective.\\n\\nMy focus now is to understand the world comprehensively, fully and accurately, which can make my decisions more correct.\\n\\nOnly by understanding this world can we change this world and create some products and services that are really needed in the market. Only by understanding this world can we understand what this world needs us to do for him. For example, why did the founder of Kuaimin Taxi make Kuaihai a taxi software? It is because it is inconvenient for him to take a taxi himself. He thinks that if we make a software, we can click on it and call the car over. Wouldn't it be more efficient? So, he made such a software that changed the world, and easily made the enterprise tens of billions.\\n\\nAs long as you understand the world, you will find many opportunities to change the world. For example, traditional industries need to use new technologies to improve their efficiency, and they can all be upgraded with the help of Internet tools. There are many opportunities to change the world. So, I am sure, as long as you choose a field and use some new technologies and new tools to change the world you understand, then it will be easy to make hundreds of millions.\\n```\",\"timestamp\":1634804049,\"title\":\"Observe this world, understand this world, change this world\"},\"digest\":\"p0zHSZG8RFPoi4FQXlI_Jepc09VXkFqvsDnONyX9WAc\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x0B27cE1053585ef548Cd78618Ee0b73D84246712\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"BVH7ghwG8vr2wmIsBben3LsbtC3usKL7YySecS3kpKbBkQzUMBpwc6Ny2uLnyyyR293TRpYpsDyNzipNR9RGRw\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x9d86f85b2660a8cb6873525924f9adb0c5f51dfb6229fed7a757ade2793c2f19347cb8076af39b12116743e30b34d1bacb42c80a0030cd272dd62c1ad0ad21081b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"FWHKuUadZNUD2AcIaH2jGL63PlPKxJxdB2P-UVSGKyo\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"TGI_NAnOwHtvZb-9m7wqNj24YxnrIjurKisiIm7dHV0\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"p0zHSZG8RFPoi4FQXlI_Jepc09VXkFqvsDnONyX9WAc\"}"
