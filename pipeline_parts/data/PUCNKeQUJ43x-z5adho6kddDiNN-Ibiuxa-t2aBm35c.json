"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"On October 8, the crypto venture capital firm Divergence Ventures was accused of improperly gaining profits from the airdrop activities of its DeFi project Ribbon Finance. Researchers of this institution used the loopholes to profit 702 ETH from the airdropped RBN tokens, worth 250. Ten thousand U.S. dollars. Divergence Ventures returned 702 ETH after being \\\"captured\\\".\\n\\nOn October 9th, a DeFi user discovered that another DeFi project, Ampleforth, also had a suspicious \\\"airdrop\\\" wallet. An anonymous address created more than 5,000 before the project announced the airdrop governance token FORTH in April this year. Two interactive addresses, after FORTH entered the secondary market, made a profit of 28 million U.S. dollars. Netizens pointedly pointed out that \\\"there is insider trading.\\\"\\n\\nWhen more and more DeFi projects choose to distribute project tokens by airdrop, users still cannot beat those who know the news in advance, and investors in the secondary market are likely to become receivers. Although DeFi claims to be a \\\"decentralized\\\" on-chain operation method to transform finance, the distribution of tokens has replaced the past layer-by-layer cash-out method of \\\"ICO issuance\\\" with \\\"airdrops to users\\\", but as long as the project has advance financing , It is difficult not to fall into the scandal of insider trading.\",\"timestamp\":1634221868,\"title\":\"Inside the DeFi project airdrop\"},\"digest\":\"rSYFr8Bcf0TujnISnXkb288kzkHiOro26va2sM0AzIA\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0xf4d69bC8197E0A34130015004C3B97A7C3cCbc70\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uQy6K14UD4EIGIurf_KBFo7vCRsM6sc-nPa-pOSVmMs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nCYOLZiRz10wpm2k5Y7T-ScW4XIdrWnK6XTIirPVx0c\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"ar8xAHYngBatMH4ECGzgis1SfvBGcHUPhUqcvdp3CijNO6eX_sZqszqviwlK2Yi3SlcGq6XIPLlc3f9RpiH1DQ\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x49f17c70bd29fea5543ca315d7a066d0cc3bf8e9af87396ba7c039f70578cc6076c9c432a2ba4e2a89a8374ceb7205de9f49b21150019fb5204b83a260b99df91c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"uQy6K14UD4EIGIurf_KBFo7vCRsM6sc-nPa-pOSVmMs\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"nCYOLZiRz10wpm2k5Y7T-ScW4XIdrWnK6XTIirPVx0c\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"rSYFr8Bcf0TujnISnXkb288kzkHiOro26va2sM0AzIA\"}"
