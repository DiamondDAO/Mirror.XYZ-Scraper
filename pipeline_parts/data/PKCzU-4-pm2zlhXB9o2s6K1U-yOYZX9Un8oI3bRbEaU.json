"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"There was a remarkable instance of this kind brought to light in the Mullings vs. Mullings divorce-case, recorded in The Lancet. It appeared that Mrs. Mullings, a few hours after her confinement at Torquay, packed her newly-born infant boy in a portmanteau, and started for London. She had telegraphed Dr. J. S. Tulloch to meet her at Paddington, where he found his patient apparently in good condition, and not weak, as he expected in a woman shortly to be confined. On the way to her apartments, which had been provided by Dr. Tulloch, Mrs. Mullings remarked to the Doctor that she had already borne her child. Dr. Tulloch was greatly surprised, and immediately inquired what she had done with the baby. She replied that it was in a box on top of the cab. When the box was opened the child was found alive. The Lancet comments on the remarkable fact that, shortly after confinement, a woman can travel six or seven hours in a railroad train, and her newly-born babe conveyed the same distance in a portmanteau, without apparent injury, and without attracting attention.\\n\\nBooth reports a remarkable case of vitality of a newly-born child which came under his observation in October, 1894. An illegitimate child, abandoned by its mother, was left at the bottom of a cesspool vault; she claimed that ten hours before Booth's visit it had been accidentally dropped during an attempt to micturate. The infant lived despite the following facts: Its delivery from an ignorant, inexperienced, unattended negress; its cord not tied; its fall of 12 feet down the pit; its ten hours' exposure in the cesspool; its smothering by foul air, also by a heavy covering of rags, paper, and straw; its pounding by three bricks which fell in directly from eight feet above (some loose bricks were accidentally dislodged from the sides of the vault, in the maneuvers to extricate the infant); its lowered temperature previous to the application of hot bottles, blankets, and the administration of cardiac stimulants. Booth adds that the morning after its discovery the child appeared perfectly well, and some two months afterward was brought into court as evidence in the case. A remarkable case of infant vitality is given on page 117.\\n\\nOperations in the Young and Old.--It might be of interest to mention that such a major operation as ovariotomy has been successfully performed in an infant. In a paper on infant ovariotomy d several instances of this nature are mentioned. Roemer successfully performed ovariotomy on a child one year and eight months old; Swartz, on a child of four; Barker, on a child of four; Knowsley Thornton, on a child of seven, and Spencer Wells Cupples, and Chenoweth, on children of eight. Rein performed ovariotomy on a girl of six, suffering from a multilocular cyst of the left ovary. He expresses his belief that childhood and infancy are favorable to laparotomy.\\n\\nKidd removed a dermoid from a child of two years and eleven months; Hooks performed the same operation on a child of thirty months. Chiene extirpated an ovary from a child of three; Neville duplicated this operation in a child one month younger; and Alcock performed ovariotomy on a child of three.\\n\\nSuccessful ovariotomies are infrequent in the extremely aged. Bennett mentions an instance in a woman of seventy-five, and Davies records a similar instance. Borsini and Terrier cite instances of successful ovariotomy in patients of seventy-seven. Carmichael performed the operation at seventy-four. Owens mentions it at eighty; and Homans at eighty-two years and four months. Dewees records a successful case of ovariotomy in a woman over sixty-seven; McNutt reports a successful instance in a patient of sixty-seven years and six months; the tumor weighed 60 pounds, and there were extensive adhesions. Maury removed a monocystic ovarian tumor from a woman of seventy-four, his patient recovering. Pippingskold mentions an ovariotomy at eighty. Terrier describes double ovariotomy for fibromata in a woman of seventy-seven. Aron speaks of an operation for pilous dermoid of the ovary in a woman of seventy-five. Shepherd reports a case of recurrent proliferous cyst in a woman of sixty-three, on whom successful ovariotomy was performed twice within nine months. Wells mentions an ovarian cyst in a woman of sixty-five, from which 72 pints of fluid were removed.\\n\\nHawkins describes the case of a musician, M. Rochard, who at the age of one hundred and seven was successfully operated on for strangulated hernia of upward of thirty hours' duration. The wound healed by first intention, and the man was well in two weeks. Fowler operated successfully for strangulated umbilical hernia on a patient of sixty-eight.\\n\\nRepeated Operations.--Franzolini speaks of a woman of fifty on whom he performed six celiotomies between June, 1879, and April, 1887. The first operation was for fibrocystic disease of the uterus. Since the last operation the woman had had remarkably good health, and there was every indication that well-merited recovery had been effected. The Ephemerides contains an account of a case in which cystotomy was repeated four times, and there is another record of this operation having been done five times on a man. Instances of repeated Cesarean section are mentioned on page 130.\\n\\nBefore leaving this subject, we mention a marvelous operation performed by Billroth on a married woman of twenty-nine, after her sixth pregnancy. This noted operator performed, synchronously, double ovariotomy and resections of portions of the bladder and ileum, for a large medullary carcinomatous growth of the ovary, with surrounding involvement. Menstruation returned three months after the operation, and in fifteen months the patient was in good health in every way, with no apparent danger of recurrence of the disease.\\n\\nSelf-performed Surgical Operations.--There have been instances in which surgeons and even laymen have performed considerable operations upon themselves. On the battlefield men have amputated\\n\\none of their own limbs that had been shattered. In such cases there would be little pain, and premeditation would not be brought into play in the same degree as in the case of M. Clever de Maldigny, a surgeon in the Royal Guards of France, who successfully performed a lithotomy on himself before a mirror. He says that after the operation was completed the urine flowed in abundance; he dressed the wound with lint dipped in an emollient solution, and, being perfectly relieved from pain, fell into a sound sleep. On the following day, M. Maldigny says, he was as tranquil and cheerful as if he had never been a sufferer. A Dutch blacksmith and a German cooper each performed lithotomy on themselves for the intense pain caused by a stone in the bladder. Tulpius, Walther, and the Ephemerides each report an instance of self-performed cystotomy.\\n\\nThe following case is probably the only instance in which the patient, suffering from vesical calculus, tried to crush and break the stone himself. J. B., a retired draper, born in 1828, while a youth of seventeen, sustained a fracture of the leg, rupture of the urethra, and laceration of the perineum, by a fall down a well, landing astride an iron bar. A permanent perineal fistula was established, but the patient was averse to any operative remedial measure. In the year 1852 he became aware of the presence of a calculus, but not until 1872 did he ask for medical assistance. He explained that he had introduced a chisel through his perineal fistula to the stone, and attempted to comminute it himself and thus remove it, and by so doing had removed about an ounce of the calculus. The physician started home for his forceps, but during the interval, while walking about in great pain, the man was relieved by the stone bursting through the perineum, falling to the floor, and breaking in two. Including the ounce already chiselled off, the stone weighed 14 1/2 ounces, and was 10 5/8 inches in its long circumference. B. recovered and lived to December, 1883, still believing that he had another piece of stone in his bladder.\\n\\nIn Holden's \\\"Landmarks\\\" we are told that the operation of dividing the Achilles tendon was first performed by an unfortunate upon himself, by means of a razor. According to Patterson, the late Mr. Symes told of a patient in North Scotland who, for incipient hip-disease, had the cautery applied at the Edinburgh Infirmary with resultant great relief. After returning home to the country he experienced considerable pain, and despite his vigorous efforts he was unable to induce any of the men to use the cautery upon him; they termed it \\\"barbarous treatment.\\\" In desperation and fully believing in the efficacy of this treatment as the best means of permanently alleviating his pain, the crippled Scotchman heated a poker and applied the cautery himself.\\n\\nWe have already mentioned the marvelous instances of Cesarean sections self-performed, and in the literature of obstetric operations many of the minor type have been done by the patient herself. In the foregoing cases it is to be understood that the operations have been performed solely from the inability to secure surgical assistance or from the incapacity to endure the pain any longer. These operations were not the self-mutilations of maniacs, but were performed by rational persons, driven to desperation by pain.\\n\\nPossibly the most remarkable instances of extensive loss of blood, with recoveries, are to be found in the older records of venesection. The chronicles of excessive bleeding in the olden days are well known to everybody. Perhaps no similar practice was so universally indulged in. Both in sickness and in health, depletion was indicated, and it is no exaggeration to say that about the hospital rooms at times the floors were covered with blood. The reckless way in which venesection was resorted to, led to its disuse, until to-day it has so vanished from medical practice that even its benefits are overlooked, and depletion is brought about in some other manner. Turning to the older writers, we find Burton describing a patient from whom he took 122 ounces of blood in four days. Dover speaks of the removal of 111 and 190 ounces; Galen, of six pounds; and Haen, of 114 ounces. Taylor relates the history of a case of asphyxia in which he produced a successful issue by extracting one gallon of blood from his patient during twelve hours. Lucas speaks of 50 venesections being practiced during one pregnancy. Van der Wiel performed venesection 49 times during a single pregnancy. Balmes mentions a case in which 500 venesections were performed in twenty-five years. Laugier mentions 300 venesections in twenty-six months. Osiander speaks of 8000 ounces of blood being taken away in thirty-five years. Pechlin reports 155 venesections in one person in sixteen years, and there is a record of 1020 repeated venesections.\\n\\nThe loss of blood through spontaneous hemorrhage is sometimes remarkable. Fabricius Hildanus reports the loss of 27 pounds of blood in a few days; and there is an older record of 40 pounds being lost in four days. Horstius, Fabricius Hildanus, and Schenck, all record instances of death from hemorrhage of the gums. Tulpius speaks of hemoptysis lasting chronically for thirty years, and there is a similar record of forty years' duration in the Ephemerides. Chapman gives several instances of extreme hemorrhage from epistaxis. He remarks that Bartholinus has recorded the loss of 48 pounds of blood from the nose; and Rhodius, 18 pounds in thirty-six hours. The Ephemerides contains an account of epistaxis without cessation for six weeks. Another writer in an old journal speaks of 75 pounds of blood from epistaxis in ten days. Chapman also mentions a case in which, by intestinal hemorrhage, eight gallons of blood were lost in a fortnight, the patient recovering. In another case a pint of blood was lost daily for fourteen days, with recovery. The loss of eight quarts in three days caused death in another case; and Chapman, again, refers to the loss of three gallons of blood from the bowel in twenty-four hours. In the case of Michelotti, recorded in the Transactions of the Royal Society, a young man suffering from enlargement of the spleen vomited 12 pounds of blood in two hours, and recovered.\\n\\nIn hemorrhoidal hemorrhages, Lieutaud speaks of six quarts being lost in two days; Hoffman, of 20 pounds in less than twenty-four hours, and Panaroli, of the loss of one pint daily for two years.\\n\\nArrow-Wounds.--According to Otis the illustrious Baron Percy was wont to declare that military surgery had its origin in the treatment of wounds inflicted by darts and arrows; he used to quote Book XI of the Iliad in behalf of his belief, and to cite the cases of the patients of Chiron and Machaon, Menelaus and Philoctetes, and Eurypiles, treated by Patroclus; he was even tempted to believe with Sextus that the name iatros, medicus, was derived from ios, which in the older times signified \\\"sagitta,\\\" and that the earliest function of our professional ancestors was the extraction of arrows and darts. An instrument called beluleum was invented during the long Peloponnesian War, over four hundred years before the Christian era. It was a rude extracting-forceps, and was used by Hippocrates in the many campaigns in which he served. His immediate successor, Diocles, invented a complicated instrument for extracting foreign bodies, called graphiscos, which consisted of a canula with hooks. Otis states that it was not until the wars of Augustus that Heras of Cappadocia designed the famous duck-bill forceps which, with every conceivable modification, has continued in use until our time. Celsus instructs that in extracting arrow-heads the entrance-wound should be dilated, the barb of the arrow-head crushed by strong pliers, or protected between the edges of a split reed, and thus withdrawn without laceration of the soft parts. According to the same authority, Paulus Aegineta also treated fully of wounds by arrow-heads, and described a method used in his time to remove firmly-impacted arrows. Albucasius and others of the Arabian school did little or nothing toward aiding our knowledge of the means of extracting foreign bodies. After the fourteenth century the attention of surgeons was directed to wounds from projectiles impelled by gunpowder. In the sixteenth century arrows were still considerably used in warfare, and we find Pare a delineating the treatment of this class of injuries with the sovereign good sense that characterized his writings. As the use of firearms became prevalent the literature of wounds from arrows became meager, and the report of an instance in the present day is very rare.\\n\\nBill has collected statistics and thoroughly discussed this subject, remarking upon the rapidity with which American Indians discharge their arrows, and states that it is exceptional to meet with only a single wound. It is commonly believed that the Indian tribes make use of poisoned arrows, but from the reports of Bill and others, this must be a very rare custom. Ashhurst states that he was informed by Dr. Schell, who was stationed for some time at Fort Laramie, that it is the universal custom to dip the arrows in blood, which is allowed to dry on them; it is not, therefore, improbable that septic material may thus be inoculated through a wound.\\n\\nMany savage tribes still make use of the poisonous arrow. The Dyak uses a sumpitan, or blow-tube, which is about seven feet long, and having a bore of about half an inch. Through this he blows his long, thin dart, anointed on the head with some vegetable poison. Braidwood speaks of the physiologic action of Dajaksch, an arrow-poison used in Borneo. Arnott has made observations relative to a substance produced near Aden, which is said to be used by the Somalies to poison their arrows. Messer of the British Navy has made inquiries into the reputed poisonous nature of the arrows of the South Sea Islanders.\\n\\nOtis has collected reports of arrow-wounds from surgical cases occurring in the U. S. Army. Of the multiple arrow-wounds, six out of the seven cases were fatal. In five in which the cranial cavity was wounded, four patients perished. There were two remarkable instances of recovery after penetration of the pleural cavity by arrows. The great fatality of arrow-wounds of the abdomen is well known, and, according to Bill, the Indians always aim at the umbilicus; when fighting Indians, the Mexicans are accustomed to envelop the abdomen, as the most vulnerable part, in many folds of a blanket.\\n\\nOf the arrow-wounds reported, nine were fatal, with one exception, in which the lesion implicated the soft parts only. The regions injured were the scalp, face, and neck, in three instances; the parietes of the chest in six; the long muscles of the back in two; the abdominal muscles in two; the hip or buttocks in three; the testis in one; the shoulder or arm in 13; forearm or hand in six; the thigh or leg in seven.\\n\\nThe force with which arrows are projected by Indians is so great that it has been estimated that the initial velocity nearly equals that of a musket-ball. At a short distance an arrow will perforate the larger bones without comminuting them, causing a slight fissure only, and resembling the effect of a pistol-ball fired through a window-glass a few yards off.\\n\\nAmong extraordinary cases of recovery from arrow-wounds, several of the most striking will be recorded. Tremaine mentions a sergeant of thirty-four who, in a fray with some hostile Indians, received seven arrow-wounds: two on the anterior surface of the right arm; one in the right axilla; one on the right side of the chest near the axillary border; two on the posterior surface of the left arm near the elbow-joint, and one on the left temple. On June 1st he was admitted to the Post Hospital at Fort Dodge, Kan. The wound on the right arm near the deltoid discharged, and there was slight exfoliation of the humerus. The patient was treated with simple dressings, and was returned to duty in July, 1870.\\n\\nGoddard mentions an arrow-wound by which the body was transfixed. The patient was a cutler's helper at Fort Rice, Dakota Territory. He was accidentally wounded in February, 1868, by an arrow which entered the back three inches to the right of the 5th lumbar vertebra, and emerged about two inches to the right of the ensiform cartilage. During the following evening the patient lost about eight ounces of blood externally, with a small amount internally. He was confined to his bed some two weeks, suffering from circumscribed peritonitis with irritative fever. In four weeks he was walking about, and by July 1st was actively employed. The arrow was deposited in the Army Medical Museum.\\n\\nMuller gives a report of an arrow-wound of the lung which was productive of pleurisy but which was followed by recovery. Kugler recites the description of the case of an arrow-wound of the thorax, complicated by frightful dyspnea and blood in the pleural cavity and in the bronchi, with recovery.\\n\\nSmart extracted a hoop-iron arrow-head, 1 3/4 inches long and 1/2 inch in breadth, from the brain of a private, about a month after its entrance. About a dram of pus followed the exit of the arrow-head. After the operation the right side was observed to be paralyzed, and the man could not remember his name. He continued in a varying condition for a month, but died on May 13, 1866, fifty-two days after the injury. At the postmortem it was found that the brain-tissue, to the extent of 3/4 inch around the track of the arrow as a center, was softened and disorganized. The track itself was filled with thick pus which extended into the ventricles.\\n\\nPeabody reports a most remarkable case of recovery from multiple arrow-wounds. In a skirmish with some Indians on June 3, 1863, the patient had been wounded by eight distinct arrows which entered different parts of the body. They were all extracted with the exception of one, which had entered at the outer and lower margin of the right scapula, and had passed inward and upward through the upper lobe of the right lung or trachea. The hemorrhage at this time was so great that all hope was abandoned. The patient, however, rallied, but continued to experience great pain on swallowing, and occasionally spat blood. In July, 1866, more than three years after the injury, he called on Dr. Peabody to undergo an examination with a view of applying for a pension, stating that his health was affected from the presence of an arrow-head. He was much emaciated, and expressed himself as tired of life. Upon probing through a small fistulous opening just above the superior end of the sternum, the point of the arrow was found resting against the bone, about 1 1/2 inches below, the head lying against the trachea and esophagus, with the carotid artery, jugular vein, and nerves overlying. After some little difficulty the point of the arrow was raised above the sternum, and it was extracted without the loss of an ounce of blood. The edge grazed against the sheath of the innominate artery during the operation. The missile measured an inch at the base, and was four inches long. The health of the patient underwent remarkable improvement immediately after the operation.\\n\\nSerious Insect-stings.--Although in this country the stings of insects are seldom productive of serious consequences, in the tropic climates death not unfrequently results from them. Wounds inflicted by large spiders, centipedes, tarantulae, and scorpions have proved fatal. Even in our country deaths, preceded by gangrene, have sometimes followed the bite of a mosquito or a bee, the location of the bite and the idiosyncrasy of the individual probably influencing the fatal issue. In some cases, possibly, some vegetable poison is introduced with the sting. Hulse, U.S.N., reports the case of a man who was bitten on the penis by a spider, and who subsequently exhibited violent symptoms simulating spinal meningitis, but ultimately recovered. Kunst mentions a man of thirty-six who received several bee-stings while taking some honey from a tree, fell from the tree unconscious, and for some time afterward exhibited signs of cerebral congestion. Chaumeton mentions a young man who did not perceive a wasp in a glass of sweet wine, and swallowed the insect. He was stung in the throat, followed by such intense inflammation that the man died asphyxiated in the presence of his friends, who could do nothing to relieve him. In connection with this case there is mentioned an English agriculturist who saved the life of one of his friends who had inadvertently swallowed a wasp with a glass of beer. Alarming symptoms manifested themselves at the moment of the sting. The farmer made a kind of paste from a solution of common salt in as little water as possible, which he gave to the young man, and, after several swallows of the potion, the symptoms disappeared as if by enchantment. There is a recent account from Bridgeport, Conn., of a woman who, while eating a pear, swallowed a hornet that had alighted on the fruit. In going down the throat the insect stung her on the tonsil. Great pain and inflammation followed, and in a short time there was complete deprivation of the power of speech.\\n\\nMease relates the case of a corpulent farmer who, in July, 1835, was stung upon the temple by a common bee. He walked to a fence a short distance away, thence to his house, 20 yards distant, lay down, and expired in ten minutes. A second case, which occurred in June, 1811, is also mentioned by Mease. A vigorous man was stung in the septum of the nose by a bee. Supported by a friend he walked to his house, a few steps distant, and lay down. He rose immediately to go to the well, stepped a few paces, fell, and expired. It was thirty minutes from the time of the accident to the man's death. A third case is reported by the same author from Kentucky. A man of thirty-five was stung on the right superior palpebrum, and died in twenty minutes. Mease reports a fourth ease from Connecticut, in which a man of twenty-six was stung by a bee on the tip of the nose. He recovered after treatment with ten-grain doses of Dover's Powder, and persistent application of plantain leaves. A fifth case was that of a farmer in Pennsylvania who was stung in the left side of the throat by a wasp which he had swallowed in drinking cider. Notwithstanding medical treatment, death ensued twenty-seven hours afterward. A sixth case, which occurred in October, 1834, is given by the same author. A middle-aged man was stung by a yellow wasp on the middle finger of the right hand, and died in less than twenty minutes after having received his wound. A seventh case was that of a New York farmer who, while hoeing, was bitten on the foot by a spider. Notwithstanding medical treatment, principally bleeding, the man soon expired.\\n\\nDesbrest mentions the sting of a bee above the eyebrow followed by death. Zacutus saw a bee-sting which was followed by gangrene. Delaistre mentions death from a hornet-sting in the palate. Nivison relates the case of a farmer of fifty who was stung in the neck by a bee. The usual swelling and discoloration did not follow, but notwithstanding vigorous medical treatment the man died in six days. Thompson relates three cases of bee-sting, in all of which death supervened within fifteen minutes,--one in a farmer of fifty-eight who was stung in the neck below the right ear; a second in an inn-keeper of fifty who was stung in the neck, and a third of a woman of sixty-four who was stung on the left brow. \\\"Chirurgus\\\" recalls the details of a case of a wasp-sting in the middle finger of the right hand of a man of forty, depriving him of all sense and of muscular power. Ten minutes after receiving it he was unconscious, his heart-beats were feeble, and his pulse only perceptible.\\n\\nSyphilis from a Flea-bite.--Jonathan Hutchinson, in the October, 1895, number of his unique and valuable Archives of Surgery, reports a primary lesion of most unusual origin. An elderly member of the profession presented himself entirely covered with an evident syphilitic eruption, which rapidly disappeared under the use of mercury. The only interest about the case was the question as to how the disease had been acquired. The doctor was evidently anxious to give all the information in his power, but was positive that he had never been exposed to any sexual risk, and as he had retired from practice, no possibility of infection in that manner existed. He willingly stripped, and a careful examination of his entire body surface revealed no trace of lesion whatever on the genitals, or at any point, except a dusky spot on one leg, which looked like the remains of a boil. This, the doctor stated, had been due to a small sore, the dates of the appearance and duration of which were found to fit exactly with those of a primary lesion. There had also been some enlargement of the femoral glands. He had never thought of the sore in this connection, but remembered most distinctly that it followed a flea-bite in an omnibus, and had been caused, as he supposed, by his scratching the place, though he could not understand why it lasted so long. Mr. Hutchinson concludes that all the evidence tends to show that the disease had probably been communicated from the blood of an infected person through the bite of the insect. It thus appears that even the proverbially trivial fleabite may at times prove a serious injury.\\n\\nSnake-bites.--A writer in an Indian paper asserts that the traditional immunity of Indian snake-charmers is due to the fact that having been accidentally bitten by poisonous serpents or insects more than once, and having survived the first attack, they are subsequently immune. His assertion is based on personal acquaintance with Madari Yogis and Fakirs, and an actual experiment made with a Mohammedan Fakir who was immune to the bites of scorpions provided by the writer. The animals were from five to seven inches long and had lobster-like claws. Each bite drew blood, but the Fakir was none the worse.\",\"timestamp\":1639719128,\"title\":\"\\nInfant-vitality is sometimes quite remarkable, a newly-born child sometimes surviving extreme exposure and major injuries. \"},\"digest\":\"NF_RBf51d2lN1vCY4iR6mdjVBGsCErw02XLCgyoNcas\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x1928Fa8c1480697A043aA639A3c2C52BE5B7890a\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"q-OJmM7QAMit8z3uF2efuVIhnK2c7Hp8Ofz8vg2EYic\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e5jp8N7nJqLGQSNQcWfdbB8BhaObLV7x73i-GM2Tg9Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"02W2ikC2VoAEp4943QILQ5nmR3jZfDeZVkxWHFRdCfX457_HaCJABOkRiBsTLGqSYbMLRYJhyAJHU56usljHAg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x2bd26c3b669074dd03b7386848c6d575f2905a4d132015a7894c8a58aba1136229831661e3fa18dac23dc57d2d74ea8dc35569e9aa9ae6ad5dc15fbbd7570c631c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"q-OJmM7QAMit8z3uF2efuVIhnK2c7Hp8Ofz8vg2EYic\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"e5jp8N7nJqLGQSNQcWfdbB8BhaObLV7x73i-GM2Tg9Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"NF_RBf51d2lN1vCY4iR6mdjVBGsCErw02XLCgyoNcas\"}"
