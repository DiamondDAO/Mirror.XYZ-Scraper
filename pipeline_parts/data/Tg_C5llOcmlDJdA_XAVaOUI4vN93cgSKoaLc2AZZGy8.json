"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"**All previous guesses about Satoshi Nakamoto were wrong, and only I know who Satoshi Nakamoto is.**\\n\\nHe is in infinite darkness, hollow, empty, cold, and endless. I don’t know how long he’s been trapped here, but after all, no one has seen him since his last appearance in 2014.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*vbKUCn9xee7yCHehDXMUvA.png)\\n\\nIf you don’t live under a rock, you’ve most likely heard of who Satoshi Nakamoto is. Yes, we’re not referring to some clown pretending to be satoshi, but the guy who invented the blockchain and has a million bitcoins in his hand (over $50 billion!).\\n\\nBitcoin, or blockchain technology, is one of the most important inventions of the 21st century, separating two eras, cutting off the long night of internet web 2.0, and allowing mankind to see the dawn of web 3.0. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pioneer of all this and a top-ranked tycoon in the world, has sparked numerous speculations in the past.\\n\\nSatoshi Nakamoto first appeared onthe Internet as a member of cypherpunk, and while people at the time still knew nothing about the self-proclaimed Japanese-American, among those in the same cryptographic email group as him were Philip Himmelman (developer of PGP technology), John Gilmore (star employee of Sun Microsystems), Steven Bellovin ( a researcher at Bell Labs and professor of computer science at Columbia University), Bram Cohen (author of BT downloads), Timothy C. May (former chief scientist at Intel), and Assange (founder of Wikileaks), who are all top-notch titans. Later on, people inferred from some details that Satoshi Nakamoto was already prominent and had an extremely high social status before he released Bitcoin.\\n\\nAs Bitcoin became more valuable, many clowns came forward to admit they were Satoshi Nakamoto — oh sorry, no offense to the profession of clowning — it’s just that their demeanor made me laugh. But in the end, none of them could prove that they were Satoshi Nakamoto, just clowns who entertained the internet public by showing off. They enjoyed the fame and popularity of the name “Satoshi Nakamoto”, but never paid any price for it, cunningly stealing the fruit, through deception.\\n\\nMany decoding enthusiasts hope to infer who Satoshi Nakamoto is by the traces left by him (e.g., the first person of “WE” in the paper; the repeated use of ‘of course’ without a comma, unlike the usual method (‘ the problem of course is’); and the use of the word ‘preclude’ (which appears in only 1.5% of cryptographic papers) ……) to infer who Satoshi Nakamoto is. But with all due respect, I’m afraid this approach is not so easy. Since you knew he was hiding his identity in the first place, how could you possibly find the right person by the false clues he deliberately left behind?\\n\\nSince no one can find Satoshi Nakamoto, is it possible that Satoshi Nakamoto is not a person? After an exhausting search, some netizens published more fantastical speculations: perhaps, Satoshi Nakamoto has died, that’s why he never appeared again; perhaps, Satoshi Nakamoto is a man of the future, has returned to his original time and space; perhaps Satoshi Nakamoto, is a third-class creature, guiding human progress to help Earth life to retrace their steps in civilization.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*yuMUta1aEcyunwr_)\\n\\nThis is ridiculous. Satoshi Nakamoto is not so mysterious, he is just an ordinary person like you and me.\\n\\nLong ago in the age of witchcraft, any prudent sorcerer regarded his real name as the most precious secret and the greatest threat to his life. For — as the stories say — once a sorcerer’s opponent got hold of his real name, he could kill him or make him his slave by any common magic known to all, no matter how powerful the sorcerer’s magic was and how weak and clumsy his opponent was. How weak and clumsy. — Vernor Vinci, *True Names (1984)*\\n\\nSatoshi Nakamoto doesn’t want people to know who he is, but this person is real.\\n\\nIf you want to explore who Satoshi Nakamoto is, you might want to listen to this story of mine.\\n\\n> **A flame**\\n\\n“Flame, it wasn’t when humans learned to take fire that flame appeared. Flames have always existed, it was only when humans first learned to take fire from trees struck by lightning that they understood the existence of flames, and then flames appeared in the consciousness of humans.”\\n\\nA long, long time ago, there was a strange man, I do not know how old he was, but looking at his white beard and hair, he should not be young; of course, he was not Japanese, you can make this judgment easily by looking at him, he certainly did not look Asian.\\n\\nHe is a standard anarchist, a long time ago, when people just put forward the concept of web 2.0, he was already fumbling for the road to web 3.0.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*XjFZgRhfalXhAi6d)\\n\\nAt that time, the UGC creation model was just emerging, and the large companies using “platform” as their service model were expanding rapidly. At that time, people had a common question which most of us ignore now: Take video sites as an example, users uploaded one video for viewers to consume, and viewers’ video consumption led to the viewing and clicking of advertisements, however, video authors could only get a meager income from their videos — most of the paid revenue went to the platform companies, and video authors only got the number of likes and comments, and a pitiful share of the traffic.\\n\\nThe big companies have done most of the work in creating the framework of the platform, and the rest are only sewn on top of the original; countless users have gone on to create huge amounts of consumer content for others, but the big companies have grabbed most of the revenue by their monopoly position.\\n\\nHabit is a terrible force. People are now so accustomed to this selfish system of revenue distribution that few people find it unreasonable anymore. The strange man, however, has long recognized the reality of inequality and has been working to find a solution to this distortion since long ago.\\n\\nFinally, in 2009 he succeeded in discovering a decentralized, distributed bookkeeping method and built a peer-to-peer electronic cash system based on it.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1138/0\\\\*tSIG27-09HxnlZqf)\\n\\nIt was like after eating raw food for 10,000 years, humans finally discovered the existence of flame. After a long development of civilizational derivation, he became the first human to go to web 3.0.\\n\\nBefore talking about why the strange man is obsessed with web 3.0, we first need to figure out some questions:\\n\\nWhat is web 3.0 and what is the difference between it and web 1.0 and web 2.0?\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*4slC16daqvDuslCU)\\n\\nThe essence of web1.0: **union**\\n\\nThe essence of web2.0: **interaction**\\n\\nThe essence of web3.0: **freedom**\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*wv-pXH8Eqgp5tja7)\\n\\nIn the 1990s, when the Internet was just born and web 1.0 was implemented, users could only passively browse text, images, and simple video content; what the site offered, the user viewed, and there was little interaction to speak of.\\n\\nThen in 2003, the concept of web 2.0 was introduced by Dale Doherty, vice president of O’Reilly Media, where users were not only visitors, but could also upload their content to the site for revenue, redefining business operations and marketing, and most of us are still living in the web 2.0 era today.\\n\\nBut the centralized network is increasingly unable to meet human needs. After decades of development, the big companies that emerged in the web 1.0 and 2.0 era have increasingly departed from advanced productivity:\\n\\nPeople want tokens and currencies to circulate freely between platforms, but large companies have built thick barriers for their products;\\n\\nPeople want to be reasonably rewarded for the content they generate for consumption, but big companies are obsessed with suppressing other platforms to maintain monopoly status;\\n\\nPeople want to protect their privacy, but privacy leaks, unequal user agreements, and big companies force users to bend backward in order to use their services.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*1MPEExDiW_WYN6a_)\\n\\nSince the first days of human civilization, true freedom has been a mere luxury: a very small number of people running the lives of a very large number of people, a very small number of people occupying the vast majority of the world’s wealth.\\n\\nCan you imagine? If one day governments needed money desperately — as they did during the Covid-19 pandemic — what would they do? The answer is to print more money. You would see trillions of dollars appearing in the world out of thin air, but the world’s productivity has not increased, and the value of the dollar has been diluted — a dollar in everyone’s hand is no longer worth as much as a dollar was before.\\n\\nBut it’s all starting to change! The unreasonable centralized approach is nearing its twilight and the decentralized distributed bookkeeping approach is sounding its death knell! The history of human centralization has reached its peak in 2009, and more and more of humanity will enter a freer 3.0 era!\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*IMDrZCtsrXDLZk_k)\\n\\n**Features of web3.0:**\\n\\n1, Unified identity authentication system\\n\\n2, Data authentication and authorization\\n\\n3, Privacy protection and anti-censorship\\n\\n4, Decentralized operation\\n\\nToo many people focus on the speculative value of the e-cash system developed by the strange man while ignoring its impact and influence on the history of human civilization. For history, creating the path to web 3.0 is the greatest contribution he has made to humanity.\\n\\nSure, it’s important to make money, too. But the history of the industrial revolution has taught us more than once that the people who best represent advanced productivity make a lot of money along the way. Those who were involved in mining bitcoins in the early years are now invariably wealthy.\\n\\nAnd so is the strange man, who has amassed a fortune of over $50 billion while he bridges the path from 2.0 to 3.0, making him one of the richest people ever to walk the earth — but he doesn’t care.\\n\\n> **A Phantom**\\n\\n“The Phantom, a phantom is haunting the modern world. Some centralized governments and large Internet companies are terrified of it, and oppressed ordinary people are awakening to the ghostly flickering fire of the phantom. The name of this phantom is the decentralized state.”\\n\\nAs many blockchain enthusiasts know, in the founding block of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto left an unmodifiable quote: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.” This was the front-page headline of the Times that day, which is a description of when the blockchain was founded, is also a cynical comment on the old fragile banking system during the financial crisis.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1226/0\\\\*SqQknQKPZXi8oaJ0)\\n\\nLow class, unconscious, and in an objective universe, humans have always been “blind”. Most people cannot understand a concept out of thin air, just as even if we traveled back to the 19th century, Darwin could not guide mankind to the concept of the Internet. The derivation of history comes from the accumulation of time and fleeting inspiration, and in the transitional stage, with just the right amount of guidance, human beings can accomplish sublimation.\\n\\nHow can something exist with a unique universal value, which cannot be stripped away or eliminated, and coexist with the world?\\n\\nOnce the flame is discovered, it will never be forgotten again unless the last human dies.\\n\\nBitcoin is also like the flame, someone lit a small fire on a vast wheat field. You know that one day it will destroy the entire farmland and be reborn on the ruins.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*V2Uu6AAwDtj4zmIe)\\n\\nweb3.0 is not only the innovation of technology but also the innovation of ideas, which in turn guides the development and application of technology.\\n\\nPrivacy in an open society requires anonymous transaction systems. Anonymous transaction systems are not secret transaction systems. For hundreds of years, cash has carried out this duty, people whispered, talked in the dark, closed doors to keep out prying eyes, sealed their will in envelopes, and even then could not fully defend their privacy; over the decades, information technology has advanced rapidly, people have become more and more familiar with settling payments on the Internet, and to be able to trade in “trust”, we have to completely expose our privacy to third-party platform companies.\\n\\nBut is this reasonable? The essence of an anonymous system should be that each person reveals his or her identity only when he or she wants to. So humanity in 2021 is gradually coming together to create systems that allow anonymous transactions to happen. Past technologies did not allow for robust privacy, but blockchain technology does.\\n\\nThere was a lot of promise when the Internet was first born, but the benefits have been taken over by a few huge, unseemly companies over the last few decades. We can build great cities and replace them with thriving economies. We have the tools, and the seeds have been planted.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*haoNtJVErLNYNC9N)\\n\\nIn many books, movies, and games, humans are always worried about the possibility of our society entering cyberpunk. People fear that with the development of computer technology, every detail of our lives will become a dark zone controlled by the computer network, and that the ugly weaknesses of the corporatocracy will become more and more evident, and that people will eventually become drained of their value as human puppets.\\n\\nIn web 3.0, people are firmly in control of their values. In the emerging information marketplace, encrypted anarchy will create a fluid marketplace for all the materials that can be put into words and pictures, just as seemingly small inventions like barbed wire have made farm fences possible. Centuries ago land and property rights in the West were revolutionized by the creation of barbed wire, and now, centuries later, mathematics will be the wire cutters that break down any barbed wire fence surrounding intellectual property, allowing everyone to hold on to their value!\\n\\nBefore cryptocurrency and blockchain became the new technological trend and economic revolution, the nascent corporate kingdoms proudly exercised their unequal privileges. But the emergence of Satoshi Nakamoto fundamentally killed the possibility of humanity going cyberpunk. Now it’s the turn of the large capital firms to be terrified, and they are alarmed to discover: people’s transactions are no longer conducted under their watch, they can no longer extract benefits from people’s interactions, and the monopolies on which they depend are worthless in the face of decentralization.\\n\\nJust as the printing press destroyed the power of the medieval guilds and the power structures of the old aristocracy, so the cryptographic approach will fundamentally change the nature of corporations and government intervention in economic transactions. So in the past, you may have heard many lies that suppress, demagogue, and deceive people into believing that a free and liberated web 3.0 exists.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/900/0\\\\*YZ71zbOViIfWAwGh)\\n\\nBut just then, while Mike was watching *Love, Death & Robots*, a certain cloud miner in Grey’s house two blocks away was constantly transferring video footage of the next episode for him.\\n\\nWhen Mike pulled out his phone to pay a $13.99 membership fee to Netflix to watch *Love, Death & Robots*, Grey’s cloud miner earned $0.20 a day by transferring files to people nearby.\\n\\nWhile Mike is still just an ordinary Internet user living in web 2.0, Grey is already a participant in web 3.0.\\n\\nweb3.0 will give birth to a new kingdom, a kingdom no longer divided by geography and boundaries, but a kingdom with interests, languages, and themes as beacons, gathered and managed by all. Depending on the content produced, you have the opportunity to create a new Internet kingdom and become a king; you may also become the most trusted person in the online community and become the president in the election of the Internet kingdom. You will have citizens from all corners of the planet, and no more unequal ministers taking your rights and benefits in the name of “service”.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/1\\\\*NIxuN_M2hB4SJY4P18mH5Q.png)\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1380/0\\\\*8xnQv2LWPKcczYsO)\\n\\nPreviously, we were powerless to confront entrenched state monopolies and had to submit to the collusion between governments and business giants.\\n\\nEmerging from the darkness of the digital underworld, Satoshi Nakamoto leads the public in confronting the banking oligarchs and multinational corporations, and the interests that profit from our ignorance of the properties of money.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0\\\\*b2mwp8DR2auDFevu)\\n\\nWake up!\\n\\nAll you will lose is the shackles, all you will gain is the world!\\n\\n> **Serendipitous discovery**\\n\\nSo, I get the point, but what the fuck do you mean?\\n\\nBack to the question in the opening paragraph:\\n\\nWhere the hell did Satoshi Nakamoto go?\\n\\nWhy did he only open the path from web 2.0 to web 3.0 but didn’t continue to lead the way?\\n\\nThe world’s greatest inventions are born in a moment of inadvertence, and on an ordinary night two weeks ago, I accidentally stumbled upon Satoshi Nakamoto himself.\\n\\nIt probably drained all the luck I’ve got in my lifetime. I mean, I was a believer in Satoshi Nakamoto long before I came into contact with him.\\n\\nLike everyone else, I had a lot of burning questions for Satoshi Nakamoto to answer: Why did you disappear? Why are you here? Do you know how exaggerated bitcoin has gone up now after 2014 ( forgive me, I too am a vulgar man with greed for money)?\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/806/0\\\\*a0UpKRlEslxuiLf1)\\n\\nBut he obviously can’t talk to me with clarity — he’s in cyberspace, let’s call it “some special virtual world”, not the usual cell phone or computer screen, but a more distorted, unreal, broken space.\\n\\nSatoshi Nakamoto is on an island, and the whole space is so strange that it’s hard for me to describe to you in limited terms what this place is — I mean, this space is reflected, and I guess this space is not what we often call a “virtual world”, but more likely “another virtual world” projected by the reflection of what we often call a “virtual world”.\\n\\nPerhaps Satoshi Nakamoto had lost his vocal organs, or perhaps the network he was on did not support voice transmission, he tried to reply to me with some messages, but all I could see was a jumble of letters, and the whole communication process was extremely difficult.\\n\\nAfter a long time of interpretation, I only clearly understood the keyword “Mirror World”, which seemed to be Satoshi Nakamoto’s name for the space he was in, but I couldn’t quite understand the deeper meaning. He seems to be trapped in this world that exists on web 2.0, and his active reply to me means that he is sending a distress signal to help him return to web 3.0.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1\\\\*YEHE4fwxFp0LrT6f9pNUdw.png)\\n\\nAnd Satoshi Nakamoto is not alone. Although he seems to be trapped in Mirror World, he is surrounded by other people — What I’m saying is, not that they are people like Satoshi Nakamoto, but in the sense that they are virtual beings that cannot be described by physical common sense, but have subjective and active consciousness — I’m not sure if I’m describing this correctly, after all, Mirror World is beyond all my previous knowledge.\\n\\nI don’t know exactly what those virtual creatures are and where they came from, but I am sure: this is a discovery of great significance. In the long river of history, mankind had inwardly domesticated communicating, sentient animals, and outwardly explored the universe for other species that could talk to us, but found nothing.\\n\\nSeeing these virtual creatures beside Satoshi Nakamoto, I finally confirmed that humans are not alone. Although I haven’t been able to get more communication with Satoshi Nakamoto to verify my suspicions, I believe that the reason why Satoshi Nakamoto was here in the first place was probably for these amazing new creatures as well.\\n\\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/778/0\\\\*JF01CJUG6svsdUiM)\\n\\nIn the following two weeks, I kept on trying to communication more with Satoshi Nakamoto, but it was difficult to get more progress. So I’m announcing my findings here to everyone, hoping more people will join me and help me decipher the garbled messages coming back from Satoshi Nakamoto.\\n\\nI will continue to make my findings public on this channel, as well as the implications of talking to Satoshi Nakamoto and Mirror World.\\n\\nIf you also trust Satoshi Nakamoto’s theories and aspire to a free and open web 3.0 world, follow along with me and you will see more unbelievable things.\",\"timestamp\":1638155078,\"title\":\"I found Satoshi Nakamoto in the Mirror World\"},\"digest\":\"MaFNXStgYvuoFXseB1jx6RsO-udPHUk07koOQAOnMSI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x9219220269444aB10DA27BeBd17475edA40D43bb\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BMwwms1ZYx9hNFCEiq1EQew5PuMXq2pYsiULeqJqKas\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kuaylE4iQvR3Z-2RJYaTnGq6JLxiyN2jL0G7dpOfU4Q\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"5A3mEvAYS7fr3nlu_kizTiKtafNqYQ6HH6yHZ9UL5id4bTXLaT6dyVdp4PxcuAM40Edv1IGspy6XpjuqJUC1Yg\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x51d8e2eb07b59e8ac0214c6e77627ed7901ae8414c54021368391ba63d2b2a947e21dee38cdd58555c6d41708205956f834ef1b25e4c67bc5cc913d145e0ba151b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"BMwwms1ZYx9hNFCEiq1EQew5PuMXq2pYsiULeqJqKas\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"kuaylE4iQvR3Z-2RJYaTnGq6JLxiyN2jL0G7dpOfU4Q\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"MaFNXStgYvuoFXseB1jx6RsO-udPHUk07koOQAOnMSI\"}"
