"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"well, then, all the more, as they grew up, you should have taken occasion to talk to them about yourself.  Did your little boy never petition you for a story about yourself; and as he grew up did you never confide to him what you have never confided to his mother?  Something, as I was saying, that made you sad when you were a boy and a rising man, with a sadness your son can still see in you as you talk to him. In conversations like that a boy finds out what a friend he has in his father, and his father from that day has his best friend in his son.  And then as Matthew grew up and began to out-grow his brothers and to form friendships out of doors, did you study to talk at the proper time to him, and on subjects on which you never venture to talk about to any other boy or man?  You men, Charity went on to say, live in a world of your own, and though we women are well out of it, yet we cannot be wholly ignorant that it is there.  And, we may well be wrong, but we cannot but think that fathers, if not mothers, might safely tell their men-children at least more than they do tell them of the sure dangers that lie straight in their way, of the sorrow that men and women bring on one another, and of what is the destruction of so many cities.  We may well be wrong, for we are only women, but I have told you what we all think who keep this house and hear the reports and repentances of pilgrims, both Piety and Prudence and I myself.  And I, for one, largely agree with the three women.  It is easier said than done.  But the simple saying of it may perhaps lead some fathers and mothers to think about it, and to ask whether or no it is desirable and advisable to do it, which of them is to attempt it, on what occasion, and to what extent.  Christian by this time had the Slough of Despond with all its history and all that it contained to tell his eldest son about; he had the wicket gate also just above the slough, the hill Difficulty, the Interpreter's House, the place somewhat ascending with a cross standing upon it, and a little below, in the bottom, a sepulchre, not to speak of her who assaulted Faithful, whose name was Wanton, and who at one time was like to have done even that trusty pilgrim a life-long mischief.  Christian rather boasted to Charity of his wariness, especially in the matter of his children's amusements, but Charity seemed to think that he had carried his wariness into other matters besides amusements, without the best possible results there either. I have sometimes thought with her that among our multitude of congresses and conferences of all kinds of people and upon all manner of subjects, room and membership might have been found for a conference of fathers and mothers.  Fathers to give and take counsel about how to talk to their sons, and mothers to their daughters.  I am much of Charity's mind, that, if more were done at home, and done with some frankness, for our sons and daughters, there would be fewer fathers and mothers found sitting at the Lord's table alone.  'You should have talked to them,' said Charity, with some severity in her tones, 'and, especially, you should have told them of your own sorrow.'\\n\\nAnd then, coming still closer up to Christian, Charity asked him whether he prayed, both before and after he so spoke to his children, that God would bless what he said to them.  Charity believeth all things, hopeth all things, but when she saw this man about to sit down all alone at the supper table, it took Charity all her might to believe that he had both spoken to his children and at the same time prayed to God for them as he ought to have done.  Our old ministers used to lay this vow on all fathers and mothers at the time of baptism, that they were to pray both with and for their children.  Now, that is a fine formula; it is a most comprehensive, and, indeed, exhaustive formula.  Both with and for. And especially with.  With, at such and such times, on such and such occasions, and in such and such places.  At those times, say, when your boy has told a lie, or struck his little brother, or stolen something, or destroyed something.  To pray with him at such times, and to pray with him properly, and, if you feel able to do it, and are led to do it, to tell him something after the prayer about yourself, and your own not-yet-forgotten boyhood, and your father; it makes a fine time to mix talk and prayer together in that way.  Charity is not easily provoked, but the longer she lives and keeps the table in the House Beautiful the more she is provoked to think that there is far too little prayer among pilgrims; far too little of all kinds of prayer, but especially prayer with and for their children.  But hard as it was to tell all the truth at that moment about Christian's past walk in his house at home, yet he was able with the simple truth to say that he had indeed prayed both with and for his children, and that, as they knew and could not but remember, not seldom.  Yes, he said, I did sometimes so pray with my boys, and that too, as you may believe, with much affection, for you must think that my four boys were all very dear to me.  And it is my firm belief that all that good man's boys will come right yet:  Matthew and Joseph and James and Samuel and all. 'With much affection.'  I like that.  I have unbounded faith in those prayers, both for and with, in which there is much affection. It is want of affection, and want of imagination, that shipwrecks so many of our prayers.  But this man's prayers had both these elements of sure success in them, and they must come at last to harbour.  At that one word 'with much affection,' this man's closet door flies open and I see the old pilgrim first alone, and then with his arms round his eldest son's neck, and both father and son weeping together till they are ashamed to appear at supper till they have washed their faces and got their most smiling and everyday looks put on again.  You just wait and see if Matthew and all the four boys down to the last do not escape into the Celestial City before the gate is shut.  And when it is asked, Who are these and whence came they? listen to their song and you will hear those four happy children saying that their father, when they were yet boys, both talked with them and prayed for and with them with so much affection that therefore they are before the throne.\\n\\nWhy, then, with such a father and with such makable boys, why was this household brought so near everlasting shipwreck?  It was the mother that did it.  In one word, it was the wife and the mother that did it.  It was the mistress of the house who wrought the mischief here.  She was a poor woman, she was a poor man's wife, and one would have thought that she had little enough temptation to harm upon this present world.  But there it was, she did hang upon it as much as if she had been the mother of the finest daughters and the most promising boys in all the town.  Things like this were from time to time reported to her by her neighbours.  One fine lady had been heard to say that she would never have for her tradesman any man who frequented conventicles, who was not content with the religion of his betters, and who must needs scorn the parish church and do despite to the saints' days.  Another gossip asked her what she expected to make of her great family of boys when it was well known that all the gentry in the neighbourhood but two or three had sworn that they would never have a hulking Puritan to brush their boots or run their errands.  And it almost made her husband burn his book and swear that he would never be seen at another prayer- meeting when his wife so often said to him that he should never have had children, that he should never have made her his wife, and that he was not like this when they were first man and wife.  And in her bitterness she would name this wife or that maid, and would say, You should have married her.  She would have gone to the meeting-house with you as often as you wished.  Her sons are far enough from good service to please you.  'My wife,' he softly said, 'was afraid of losing the world.  And then, after that, my growing sons were soon given over, all I could do, to the foolish delights of youth, so that, what by one thing and what by another, they left me to wander in this manner alone.'  And I suppose there is scarcely a household among ourselves where there have not been serious and damaging misunderstandings between old-fashioned fathers and their young people about what the old people called the 'foolish delights' of their sons and daughters.  And in thinking this matter over, I have often been struck with how Job did when his sons and his daughters were bent upon feasting and dancing in their eldest brother's house.  The old man did not lay an interdict upon the entertainment.  He did not take part in it, but neither did he absolutely forbid it.  If it must be it must be, said the wise patriarch.  And since I do not know whom they may meet there, or what they may be tempted to do, I will sanctify them all.  I will not go up into my bed till I have prayed for all my seven sons and three daughters, each one of them by their names; and till they come home safely I will rise every morning and offer burnt- offerings according to the number of them all.  And do you think that those burnt-offerings and accompanying intercessions would go for nothing when the great wind came from the wilderness and smote the four corners of the banqueting-house?  If you cannot banish the love of foolish delights out the hearts of your sons and daughters, then do not quarrel with them over such things; a family quarrel in a Christian man's house is surely far worse than a feast or a dance.  Only, if they must feast and dance and such like, be you all the more diligent in your exercises at home on their behalf till they are back again, where, after all, they like best to be, in their good, kind, liberal, and loving father's house.\\n\\nHave you a family?  Are you a married man?  Or, if not, do you hope one day to be?  Then attend betimes to what Charity says to Christian in the House Beautiful, and not less to what he says back again to her.\\n\\nSHAME\\n\\n'Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me, and of My words, of him shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when He shall come in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.'--Our Lord.\\n\\nShame has not got the attention that it deserves either from our moral philosophers or from our practical and experimental divines. And yet it would well repay both classes of students to attend far more to shame.  For, what really is shame?  Shame is an original instinct planted in our souls by our Maker, and intended by Him to act as a powerful and pungent check to our doing of any act that is mean or dishonourable in the eyes of our fellow-men.  Shame is a kind of social conscience.  Shame is a secondary sense of sin.  In shame, our imagination becomes a kind of moral sense.  Shame sets up in our bosom a not undivine tribunal, which judges us and sentences us in the absence or the silence of nobler and more awful sanctions and sentences.  But then, as things now are with us, like all the rest of the machinery of the soul, shame has gone sadly astray both in its objects and in its operations, till it demands a long, a severe, and a very noble discipline over himself before any man can keep shame in its proper place and directed in upon its proper objects.  In the present disorder of our souls, we are all acutely ashamed of many things that are not the proper objects of shame at all; while, on the other hand, we feel no shame at all at multitudes of things that are really most blameworthy, dishonourable, and contemptible.  We are ashamed of things in our lot and in our circumstances that, if we only knew it, are our opportunity and our honour; we are ashamed of things that are the clear will and the immediate dispensation of Almighty God.  And, then, we feel no shame at all at the most dishonourable things, and that simply because the men around us are too coarse in their morals and too dull in their sensibilities to see any shame in such things.  And thus it comes about that, in the very best of men, their still perverted sense of shame remains in them a constant snare and a source of temptation.  A man of a fine nature feels keenly the temptation to shrink from those paths of truth and duty that expose him to the cruel judgments and the coarse and scandalising attacks of public and private enemies.  It was in the Valley of Humiliation that Shame set upon Faithful, and it is a real humiliation to any man of anything of this pilgrim's fine character and feeling to be attacked, scoffed at, and held up to blame and opprobrium.  And the finer and the more affectionate any man's heart and character are, the more he feels and shrinks from the coarse treatment this world gives to those whom it has its own reasons to hate and assail.  They had the stocks and the pillory and the shears in Bunyan's rude and uncivilised day, by means of which many of the best men of that day were exposed to the insults and brutalities of the mob.  The newspapers would be the pillory of our day, were it not that, on the whole, the newspaper press is conducted with such scrupulous fairness and with a love of truth and justice such that no man need shrink from the path of duty through fear of insult and injury.\\n\\nBut it is time to come to the encounter between Shame and Faithful in the Valley of Humiliation.  Shame, properly speaking, is not one of our Bunyan gallery of portraits at all.  Shame, at best, is but a kind of secondary character in this dramatic book.  We do not meet with Shame directly; we only hear about him through the report of Faithful.  That first-class pilgrim was almost overcome of Shame, so hot was their encounter; and it is the extraordinarily feeling, graphic, and realistic account of their encounter that Faithful gives us that has led me to take up Shame for our reproof and correction to-night.\\n\\nReligion altogether, but especially all personal religion, said Shame to Faithful, is an unmanly business.  There is a certain touch of smallness and pitifulness, he said, in all religion, but especially in experimental religion.  It brings a man into junctures and into companionships, and it puts offices and endurances upon one such as try a man if he has any greatness of spirit about him at all.  This life on which you are entering, said Shame, will cost you many a blush before you are done with it.  You will lay yourself open to many a scoff.  The Puritan religion, and all the ways of that religious fraternity, are peculiarly open to the shafts of ridicule.  Now, all that was quite true.  There was no denying the truth of what Shame said.  And Faithful felt the truth of it all, and felt it most keenly, as he confessed to Christian.  The blood came into my face as the fellow spake, and what he said for a time almost beat me out of the upward way altogether.  But in this dilemma also all true Christians can fall back, as Faithful fell back, upon the example of their Master.  In this as in every other experience of temptation and endurance, our Lord is the forerunner and the example of His people.  Our Lord was in all points tempted like as we are, and among all His other temptations He was tempted to be ashamed of His work on earth and of the life and the death His work led Him into.  He must have often felt ashamed at the treatment He received during His life of humiliation, as it is well called; and He must often have felt ashamed of His disciples:  but all that is blotted out by the crowning shame of the cross.  We hang our worst criminals rather than behead or shoot them, in order to heap up the utmost possible shame and disgrace upon them, as well as to execute justice upon them.  And what the hangman's rope is in our day, all that the cross was in our Lord's day.  And, then, as if the cross itself was not shame enough, all the circumstances connected with His cross were planned and carried out so as to heap the utmost possible shame and humiliation upon His head.  Our prison warders have to watch the murderers in their cells night and day, lest they should take their own life in order to escape the hangman's rope; but our Lord, keenly as He felt His coming shame, said to His horrified disciples, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, when the Son of Man shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on; and they shall scourge Him and put Him to death.  Do you ever think of your Lord in His shame?  How they made a fool of Him, as we say.  How they took off His own clothes and put on Him now a red cloak and now a white; how they put a sword of lath in His hand, and a crown of thorns on His head; how they bowed the knee before Him, and asked royal favours from Him; and then how they spat in His face, and struck Him on the cheek, while the whole house rang with shouts of laughter.  And, then, the last indignity of man, how they stripped Him naked and lashed His naked and bleeding body to a whipping- post.  And how they wagged their heads and put out their tongues at Him when He was on the tree, and invited Him to come down and preach to them now, and they would all become His disciples.  Did not Shame say the simple truth when he warned Faithful that religion had always and from the beginning made its followers the ridicule of their times?\\n\\nIf you are really going to be a religious man, Shame went on, you will have to carry about with you a very tender conscience, and a more unmanly and miserable thing than a tender conscience I cannot conceive.  A tender conscience will cost you something, let me tell you, to keep it.  If nothing else, a tender conscience will all your life long expose you to the mockery and the contempt of all the brave spirits of the time.  That also is true.  At any rate, a tender conscience will undoubtedly compel its possessor to face the brave spirits of the time.  There is a good story told to this present point about Sir Robert Peel, a Prime Minister of our Queen. When a young man, Peel was one of the guests at a select dinner- party in the West-end of London.  And after the ladies had left the table the conversation of the gentlemen took a turn such that it could not have taken as long as the ladies were present.  Peel took no share in the stories or the merriment that went on, and, at last, he rose up and ordered his carriage, and, with a burning face, left the room.  When he was challenged as to why he had broken up the pleasant party so soon, he could only reply that his conscience would not let him stay any longer.  No doubt Peel felt the mocking laughter that he left behind him, but, as Shame said to Faithful, the tenderness of the young statesman's conscience compelled him to do as he did.  But we are not all Peels.  And there are plenty of workshops and offices and dinner-tables in our own city, where young men who would walk up to the cannon's mouth without flinching have not had Peel's courage to protest against indecency or to confess that they belonged to an evangelical church.  If a church is only sufficiently unevangelical there is no trial of conscience or of courage in confessing that you belong to it.  But as Shame so ably and honestly said, that type of religion that creates a tender conscience in its followers, and sets them to watch their words and their ways, and makes them tie themselves up from all hectoring liberty--to choose that religion, and to cleave to it to the end, will make a young man the ridicule still of all the brave spirits round about him.  Ambitious young men get promotion and reward every day among us for desertions and apostasies in religion, for which, if they had been guilty of the like in war, they would have been shot.  'And so you are a Free Churchman, I am told.'  That was all that was said.  But the sharp youth understood without any more words, and he made his choice accordingly; till it is becoming a positive surprise to find the rising members of certain professions in certain churches.  The Quakers have a proverb in England that a family carriage never drives for two generations past the parish church door.  Of which state of matters Shame showed himself a shrewd prophet two hundred years ago when he said that but few of the rich and the mighty and the wise remained long of Faithful's Puritan opinion unless they were first persuaded to be fools, and to be of a voluntary fondness to venture the loss of all.\\n\\nAnd I will tell you two other things, said sharp-sighted and plain- spoken Shame, that your present religion will compel you to do if you adhere to it.  It will compel you from time to time to ask your neighbour's forgiveness even for petty faults, and it will insist with you that you make restitution when you have done the weak and the friendless any hurt or any wrong.  And every manly mind will tell you that life is not worth having on such humbling terms as those are.  Whatever may be thought about Shame in other respects, it cannot be denied that he had a sharp eye for the facts of life, and a shrewd tongue in setting those facts forth.  He has hit the blot exactly in the matter of our first duty to our neighbour; he has put his finger on one of the matters where so many of us, through a false shame, come short.  It costs us a tremendous struggle with our pride to go to our neighbour and to ask his forgiveness for a fault, petty fault or other.  Did you ever do it? When did you do it last, to whom, and for what?  One Sabbath morning, now many years ago, I had occasion to urge this elementary evangelical duty on my people here, and I did it as plainly as I could.  Next day one of my young men, who is now a devoted and honoured elder, came to me and told me that he had done that morning what his conscience yesterday told him in the church to do. He had gone to a neighbour's place of business, had asked for an interview, and had begged his neighbour's pardon.  I am sure neither of those two men have forgotten that moment, and the thought of it has often since nerved me to speak plainly about some of their most unwelcome duties to my people.  Shame, no doubt, pulled back my noble friend's hand when it was on the office bell, but, like Faithful in the text, he shook him out of his company and went in.  I spoke of the remarkable justice of the newspaper press in the opening of these remarks.  And it so happens that, as I lay down my pen to rest my hand after writing this sentence and lift a London evening paper, I read this editorial note, set within the well-known brackets at the end of an indignant and expostulatory letter:  \\\\['Our correspondent's complaint is just.  The paragraph imputing bad motives should not have been admitted.'\\\\]  I have no doubt that editor felt some shame as he handed that apologetic note to the printer.  But not to speak of any other recognition and recompense, he has the recompense of the recognition of all honourable-minded men who have read that honourable admission and apology.\\n\\nShame was quite right in his scoff about restitution also.  For restitution rings like a trumpet tone through the whole of the law of Moses, and then the New Testament republishes that law if only in the exquisite story of Zaccheus.  And, indeed, take it altogether, I do not know where to find in the same space a finer vindication of Puritan pulpit ethics than just in this taunting and terrifying attack on Faithful.  There is no better test of true religion both as it is preached and practised than just to ask for and to grant forgiveness, and to offer and accept restitution. Now, does your public and private life defend and adorn your minister's pulpit in these two so practical matters?  Could your minister point to you as a proof of the ethics of evangelical teaching?  Can any one in this city speak up in defence of your church and thus protest:  'Say what you like about that church and its ministers, all I can say is, that its members know how to make an apology; as, also, how to pay back with interest what they at one time damaged or defrauded'?  Can any old creditor's widow or orphan stand up for our doctrine and defend our discipline pointing to you?  If you go on to be a Puritan, said Shame to Faithful, you will have to ask your neighbour's forgiveness even for petty faults, and you will have to make restitution with usury where you have taken anything from any one, and how will you like that?\\n\\nAnd what did you say to all this, my brother?  Say?  I could not tell what to say at the first.  I felt my blood coming up into my face at some of the things that Shame said and threatened.  But, at last, I began to consider that that which is highly esteemed among men is often had in abomination with God.  And I said to myself again, Shame tells me what men do and what men think, but he has told me nothing about what He thinks with Whom I shall soon have alone to do.  Therefore, thought I, what God thinks and says is wisest and best, let all the men of the world say what they will. Let all false shame, then, depart from my heart, for how else shall I look upon my Lord, and how shall He look upon me at His coming?\\n\\nTALKATIVE\\n\\n'A man full of talk.'--Zophar. 'Let thy words be few.'--The Preacher. 'The soul of religion is the practick part.'--Christian.\\n\\nSince we all have a tongue, and since so much of our time is taken up with talk, a simple catalogue of the sins of the tongue is enough to terrify us.  The sins of the tongue take up a much larger space in the Bible than we would believe till we have begun to suffer from other men's tongues and especially from our own.  The Bible speaks a great deal more and a great deal plainer about the sins of the tongue than any of our pulpits dare to do.  In the Psalms alone you would think that the psalmists scarcely suffer from anything else worth speaking about but the evil tongues of their friends and of their enemies.  The Book of Proverbs also is full of the same lashing scourge.  And James the Just, in a passage of terrible truth and power, tells us that we are already as good as perfect men if we can bridle our tongue; and that, on the other hand, if we do not bridle our tongue, all our seeming to be religious is a sham and a self-deception,--that man's religion is vain.\\n\\nWith many men and many women great talkativeness is a matter of simple temperament and mental constitution.  And a talkative habit would be a childlike and an innocent habit if the heart of talker and the hearts of those to whom he talks so much were only full of truth and love.  But our hearts and our neighbours' hearts being what they are, in the multitude of words there wanteth not sin.  So much of our talk is about our absent neighbours, and there are so many misunderstandings, prejudices, ambitions, competitions, oppositions, and all kinds of cross-interests between us and our absent neighbours, that we cannot long talk about them till our hearts have run our tongues into all manner of trespass.  Bishop Butler discourses on the great dangers that beset a talkative temperament with almost more than all his usual sagacity, seriousness, and depth.  And those who care to see how the greatest of our modern moralists deals with their besetting sin should lose no time in possessing and mastering Butler's great discourse.  It is a truly golden discourse, and it ought to be read at least once a month by all the men and all the women who have tongues in their heads.  Bishop Butler points out to his offending readers, in a way they can never forget, the certain mischief they do to themselves and to other people just by talking too much.  But there are far worse sins that our tongues fall into than the bad enough sins that spring out of impertinent and unrestrained loquacity.  There are many times when our talk, long or short, is already simple and downright evil.  It is ten to one, it is a hundred to one, that you do not know and would not believe how much you fall every day and in every conversation into one or other of the sins of the tongue. If you would only begin to see and accept this, that every time you speak or hear about your absent neighbour what you would not like him to speak or hear about you, you are in that a talebearer, a slanderer, a backbiter, or a liar,--when you begin to see and admit that about yourself, you will not wonder at what the Bible says with such bitter indignation about the diabolical sins of the tongue.  If you would just begin to-night to watch yourselves--on the way home from church, at home after the day is over, to-morrow morning when the letters and the papers are opened, and so on,--how instinctively, incessantly, irrepressibly you speak about the absent in a way you would be astounded and horrified to be told they were at that moment speaking about you, then you would soon be wiser than all your teachers in the sins and in the government of the tongue.  And you would seven times every day pluck out your tongue before God till He gives it back to you clean and kind in that land where all men shall love their neighbours, present and absent, as themselves.\\n\\nTake detraction for an example, one of the commonest, and, surely, one of the most detestable of the sins of the tongue.  And the etymology here, as in this whole region, is most instructive and most impressive.  In detraction you DRAW AWAY something from your neighbour that is most precious and most dear to him.  In detraction you are a thief, and a thief of the falsest and wickedest kind.  For your neighbour's purse is trash, while his good name is far more precious to him than all his gold.  Some one praises your neighbour in your hearing, his talents, his performances, his character, his motives, or something else that belongs to your neighbour.  Some one does that in your hearing who either does not know you, or who wishes to torture and expose you, and you fall straight into the snare thus set for you, and begin at once to belittle, depreciate, detract from, and run down your neighbour, who has been too much praised for your peace of mind and your self-control.  You insinuate something to his disadvantage and dishonour.  You quote some authority you have heard to his hurt. And so on past all our power to picture you.  For detraction has a thousand devices taught to it by the master of all such devices, wherewith to drag down and defile the great and the good.  But with all you can say or do, you cannot for many days get out of your mind the heart-poisoning praise you heard spoken of your envied neighbour.  Never praise any potter's pots in the hearing of another potter, said the author of the Nicomachean Ethics. Aristotle said potter's pots, but he really all the time was thinking of a philosopher's books; only he said potter's pots to draw off his readers' attention from himself.  Now, always remember that ancient and wise advice.  Take care how you praise a potter's pots, a philosopher's books, a woman's beauty, a speaker's speech, a preacher's sermon to another potter, philosopher, woman, speaker, or preacher; unless, indeed, you maliciously wish secretly to torture them, or publicly to expose them, or, if their sanctification is begun, to sanctify them to their most inward and spiritual sanctification.\\n\\nBackbiting, again, would seem at first sight to be a sin of the teeth rather than of the tongue, only, no sharpest tooth can tear you when your back is turned like your neighbour's evil tongue. Pascal has many dreadful things about the corruption and misery of man, but he has nothing that strikes its terrible barb deeper into all our consciences than this, that if all our friends only knew what we have said about them behind their back, we would not have four friends in all the world.  Neither we would.  I know I would not have one.  How many would you have?  And who would they be? You cannot name them.  I defy you to name them.  They do not exist. The tongue can no man tame.\\n\\n'Giving of characters' also takes up a large part of our everyday conversation.  We cannot well help characterising, describing, and estimating one another.  But, as far as possible, when we see the conversation again approaching that dangerous subject, we should call to mind our past remorse; we should suppose our absent neighbour present; we should imagine him in our place and ourselves in his place, and so turn the rising talk into another channel. For, the truth is, few of us are able to do justice to our neighbour when we begin to discuss and describe him.  Generosity in our talk is far easier for us than justice.  It was this incessant giving of characters that our Lord had in His eye when He said in His Sermon on the Mount, Judge not.  But our Lord might as well never have uttered that warning word for all the attention we give it.  For we go on judging one another and sentencing one another as if we were entirely and in all things blameless ourselves, and as if God had set us up in our blamelessness in His seat of judgment over all our fellows.  How seldom do we hear any one say in a public debate or in a private conversation, I don't know; or, It is no matter of mine; or, I feel that I am not in possession of all the facts; or, It may be so, but I must not judge.  We never hear such things as these said.  No one pays the least attention to the Preacher on the Mount.  And if any one says to us, I must not judge, we never forgive him, because his humility and his obedience so condemn all our ill-formed, prejudiced, rash, and ill-natured judgments of our neighbour.  Since, therefore, so Butler sums up, it is so hard for us to enter on our neighbour's character without offending the law of Christ, we should learn to decline that kind of conversation altogether, and determine to get over that strong inclination most of us have, to be continually talking about the concerns, the behaviour, and the deserts of our neighbours.\\n\\nNow, it was all those vices of the tongue in full outbreak in the day of James the Just that made that apostle, half in sorrow, half in anger, demand of all his readers that they should henceforth begin to bridle their tongues.  And, like all that most practical apostle's counsels, that is a most impressive and memorable commandment.  For, it is well known that all sane men who either ride on or drive unruly horses, take good care to bridle their horses well before they bring them out of their stable door.  And then they keep their bridle-hand firm closed on the bridle-rein till their horses are back in the stable again.  Especially and particularly they keep a close eye and a firm hand on their horse's bridle on all steep inclines and at all sharp angles and sudden turns in the road; when sudden trains are passing and when stray dogs are barking.  If the rider or the driver of a horse did not look at nothing else but the bridle of his horse, both he and his horse under him would soon be in the ditch,--as so many of us are at the present moment because we have an untamed tongue in our mouth on which we have not yet begun to put the bridle of truth and justice and brotherly love.  Indeed, such woe and misery has an untamed tongue wrought in other churches and in other and more serious ages than ours, that special religious brotherhoods have been banded together just on the special and strict engagement that they would above all things put a bridle on their tongues.  'What are the chief cares of a young convert?' asked such a convert at an aged Carthusian.  'I said I will take heed to my ways that I trespass not with my tongue,' replied the saintly father.  'Say no more for the present,' interrupted the youthful beginner; 'I will go home and practise that, and will come again when I have performed it.'\\n\\nNow, whatever faults that tall man had who took up so much of Faithful's time and attention, he was a saint compared with the men and the women who have just passed before us.  Talkative, as John Bunyan so scornfully names that tall man, though he undoubtedly takes up too much time and too much space in Bunyan's book, was not a busybody in other men's matters at any rate.  Nobody could call him a detractor or a backbiter or a talebearer or a liar. Christian knew him well, and had known him long, but Christian was not afraid to leave him alone with Faithful.  We all know men we feel it unsafe to leave long alone with our friends.  We feel sure that they will be talking about us, and that to our hurt, as soon as our backs are about.  But to give that tall man his due, he was not given with all his talk to tale-bearing or scandal or detraction.  Had he been guilty of any of these things, Faithful would soon have found him out, and would have left him to go to the Celestial City by himself.  But, after talking for half a day with Talkative, instead of finding out anything wrong in the tall man's talk, Faithful was so taken and so struck with it, that he stepped across to Christian and said, 'What a brave companion we have got! Surely this man will make a most excellent pilgrim!'  'So I once thought too,' said Christian, 'till I went to live beside him, and have to do with him in the business of daily life.'  Yes, it is near neighbourhood and the business of everyday life that try a talking man.  If you go to a meeting for prayer, and hear some men praying and speaking on religious subjects, you would say to yourself, What a good man that is, and how happy must his wife and children and servants and neighbours be with such an example always before them, and with such an intercessor for them always with God! But if you were to go home with that so devotional man, and try to do business with him, and were compelled to cross him and go against him, you would find out why Christian smiled so when Faithful was so full of Talkative's praises.\\n\\nBut of all the religiously-loquacious men of our day, your ministers are the chief.  For your ministers must talk in public, and that often and at great length, whether they are truly religious men at home or no.  It is their calling to talk to you unceasingly about religious matters.  You chose them to be your ministers because they could talk well.  You would not put up with a minister who could not talk well on religious things.  You estimate them by their talk.  You praise and pay them by their talk.  And if they are to live, talk incessantly to you about religion they must, and they do.  If any other man among us is not a religious man, well, then, he can at least hold his tongue. There is no necessity laid on him to speak in public about things that he does not practise at home.  But we hard-bested ministers must go on speaking continually about the most solemn things.  And if we are not extraordinarily watchful over ourselves, and extraordinarily and increasingly conscientious, if we are not steadily growing in inwardness and insight and depth and real spirituality of mind and life ourselves, we cannot escape,--our calling in life will not let us escape,--becoming as sounding brass.  There is an awful sentence in Butler that should be written in letters of fire in every minister's conscience, to the effect that continually going over religion in talk and making fine pictures of it in the pulpit, creates a professional insensibility to personal religion that is the everlasting ruin of multitudes of eloquent ministers.  That is true.  We ministers all feel that to be true.  Our miserable experience tells us that is only too true of ourselves.  What a flood of demoralising talk has been poured out from the pulpits of this one city to-day!--demoralising to preachers and to hearers both, because not intended to be put in practice.  How few of those who have talked and heard talk all this day about divine truth and human duty, have made the least beginning or the least resolve to live as they have spoken and heard!  And, yet, all will in words again admit that the soul of religion is the practick part, and that the tongue without the heart and the life is but death and corruption.\\n\\nLet us, then, this very night begin to do something practical after all this talk about talk.  And let us all begin to do something in the direct line of our present talk.  What a noble congregation of evangelical Carthusians that would make us if we all put a bridle on our tongue to-night before we left this house.  For we all have neighbours, friends, enemies, against whom we every day sin with our unbridled tongue.  We all have acquaintances we are ashamed to meet, we have been so unkind and so unjust to them with our tongue. We hang down our head when they shake our hand.  Yes, we know the men quite well of whom Pascal speaks.  We know many men who would never speak to us again if they only knew how, and how often, we have spoken about them behind their back.  Well, let us sin against them, and against ourselves, and against our Master's command and example no more.  Let this night and this lecture on Talkative and his kindred see the last of our sin against our ill-used neighbour. Let us promise God and our own consciences to-night, that we shall all this week put on a bridle about that man, and about that subject, and in that place, and in that company.  Let us say, God helping me, I shall for all this week not speak about that man at all, anything either good or bad, nor on that subject, nor will I let the conversation turn into that channel at all if I can help it.  And God will surely help us, till, after weeks and years of such prayer and such practice, we shall by slow degrees, and after many defeats, be able to say with the Psalmist, 'I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue.  I will keep my mouth with a bridle.  I will be dumb with silence.  I will hold my peace even from good.'\\n\\nJUDGE HATE-GOOD\\n\\n'Hear, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel . . . who hate the good and love the evil.'--Micah.\\n\\nThe portrait of Judge Hate-good in The Pilgrim's Progress is but a poor replica, as our artists say, of the portrait of Judge Jeffreys in our English history books.  I am sure you have often read, with astonishment at Bunyan's literary power, his wonderful account of the trial of Faithful, when, as Bunyan says, he was brought forth to his trial in order to his condemnation.  We have the whole ecclesiastical jurisprudence of Charles and James Stuart put before us in that single satirical sentence.  But, powerful as Bunyan's whole picture of Judge Hate-good's court is, it is a tame and a poor picture compared with what all the historians tell us of the injustice and cruelty of the court of Judge Jeffreys.  Macaulay's portrait of the Lord Chief Justice of England for ferocity and fiendishness beats out of sight Bunyan's picture of that judge who keeps Satan's own seal in Bunyan's Book.  Jeffreys was bred for his future work at the bar of the Old Bailey, a bar already proverbial for the licence of its tongue and for the coarseness of its cases. Jeffreys served his apprenticeship for the service that our two last Stuarts had in reserve for him so well, that he soon became, so his beggared biographer describes him, the most consummate bully that ever disgraced an English bench.  The boldest impudence when he was a young advocate, and the most brutal ferocity when he was an old judge, sat equally secure on the brazen forehead of George Jeffreys.  The real and undoubted ability and scholarship of Jeffreys only made his wickedness the more awful, and his whole career the greater curse both to those whose tool he was, and to those whose blood he drank daily.  Jeffreys drank brandy and sang lewd songs all night, and he drank blood and cursed and swore on the bench all day.  Just imagine the state of our English courts when a judge could thus assail a poor wretch of a woman after passing a cruel sentence upon her.  'Hangman,' shouted the ermined brute, 'Hangman, pay particular attention to this lady.  Scourge her soundly, man.  Scourge her till the blood runs.  It is the Christmas season; a cold season for madam to strip in.  See, therefore, man, that you warm her shoulders thoroughly.'  And you all know who Richard Baxter was.  You have all read his seraphic book, The Saints' Rest.  Well, besides being the Richard Baxter so well known to our saintly fathers and mothers, he was also, and he was emphatically, the peace-maker of the Puritan party.  Baxter's political principles were of the most temperate and conciliatory, and indeed, almost royalist kind.  He was a man of strong passions, indeed, but all the strength and heat of his passions ran out into his hatred of sin and his love of holiness, and an unsparing and consuming care for the souls of his people.  Very Faithful himself stood before the bar of Judge Jeffreys in the person of Richard Baxter.  It took all the barefaced falsehood and scandalous injustice of the crown prosecutors to draw out the sham indictment that was read out in court against inoffensive Richard Baxter.  But what was lacking in the charge of the crown was soon made up by the abominable scurrility of the judge.  'You are a schismatical knave,' roared out Jeffreys, as soon as Baxter was brought into court.  'You are an old hypocritical villain.'  And then, clasping his hands and turning up his eyes, he sang through his nose:  'O Lord, we are Thy peculiar people:  we are Thy dear and only people.'  'You old blockhead,' he again roared out, 'I will have you whipped through the city at the tail of the cart.  By the grace of God I will look after you, Richard.'  And the tiger would have been as good as his word had not an overpowering sense of shame compelled the other judges to protest and get Baxter's inhuman sentence commuted to fine and imprisonment.  And so on, and so on. But it was Jeffreys' 'Western Circuit,' as it was called, that filled up the cup of his infamy--an infamy, say the historians, that will last as long as the language and the history of England last.  The only parallel to it is the infamy of a royal house and a royal court that could welcome home and promote to honour such a detestable miscreant as Jeffreys was.  But the slaughter in Somerset was only over in order that a similar slaughter in London might begin.  Let those who have a stomach for more blood and tears follow out the hell upon earth that James Stuart and George Jeffreys together let loose on the best life of England in their now fast-shortening day.  Was Judge Jeffreys, some of you will ask me, born and bred in hell?  Was the devil his father, and original sin his mother?  Or, was he not the very devil himself come to earth for a season in English flesh?  No, my brethren, not so. Judge Jeffreys was one of ourselves.  Little George Jeffreys was born and brought up in a happy English home.  He was baptised and confirmed in an English church.  He took honours in an English university.  He ate dinners, was called to the bar, conducted cases, and took silk in an English court of justice.  And in the ripeness of his years and of his services, he wore the honourable ermine and sat upon the envied wool-sack of an English sovereign. It would have been far less awful and far less alarming to think of, had Judge Jeffreys been, as you supposed, a pure devil let loose on the Church of Christ and the awakening liberty of England. But some innocent soul will ask me next whether there has ever been any other monster on the face of the earth like Judge Jeffreys; and whether by any possibility there are any such monsters anywhere in our own day.  Yes, truth compels me to reply.  Yes, there are, plenty, too many.  Only their environment, nowadays, as our naturalists say, does not permit them to grow to such strength and dimensions as those of James Stuart, and George Jeffreys, his favourite judge.  At the same time, be not deceived by your own deceitful heart, nor by any other deceiver's smooth speeches. Judge Jeffreys is in yourself, only circumstances have not yet let him fully show himself in you.  Still, if you look close enough and deep enough into your own hearts, you will see the same wicked light glancing sometimes there that used so to terrify Judge Jeffreys' prisoners when they saw it in his wicked eyes.  If you lay your ear close enough to your own heart, you will sometimes hear something of that same hiss with which that human serpent sentenced to torture and to death the men and the women who would not submit to his command.  The same savage laughter also will sometimes all but escape your lips as you think of how your enemy has been made to suffer in body and in estate.  O yes, the very same hell-broth that ran for blood in Judge Jeffreys' heart is in all our hearts also; and those who have the least of its poison left in their hearts will be the foremost to confess its presence, and to hate and condemn and bewail themselves on account of its terrible dregs.\\n\\nHATE-GOOD is an awful enough name for any human being to bear. Those who really know what goodness is, and then, what hatred is,-- they will feel how awful a thing it is for any man to hate goodness.  But there is something among us sinful men far more awful than even that, and that is to hate God.  The carnal mind, writes the apostle Paul to the Romans--and it is surely the most terrible sentence that often terrible enough apostle ever wrote-- the carnal mind is enmity against God.  And Dr. John Owen annotating on that sentence is equally terrible.  The carnal mind, he says, has 'chosen a great enemy indeed.'  And having mentioned John Owen, will you let me once more beseech all students of divinity, that is, all students, amongst other things, of the desperate depravity of the human heart, to read John Owen's sixth volume till they have it by heart,--by a broken, believing heart. Owen On Indwelling Sin is one of the greatest works of the great Puritan period.  It is a really great, and as we nowadays say, a truly scientific work to the bargain.  But all that by the way. Yes, this carnal heart that is still left in every one of us has chosen a great enemy, and it would need both strong and faithful allies in order to fight him.  The hatred that His Son also met with when He was in this world is one of the most hateful pages of this hateful world's hateful history.  He knew His own heart towards His enemies, and thus He was able to say to the Searcher of Hearts with His dying breath, They hated Me without a cause.  Truly our hatred is hottest when it is most unjust.\\n\\n'Look to yourselves,' wrote the apostle John to the elect lady and her children.  Yes; let us all look sharply and suspiciously to ourselves in this matter now in hand, and we shall not need John Owen nor anybody else to discover to us the hatred and the hatefulness of our own hearts.  Look to yourselves, and the work of the law will soon be fulfilled in you.  Homo homini lupus, taught an old philosopher who had studied moral philosophy not in books so much as in his own heart.  'Is no man naturally good?' asked innocent Lady Macleod of Dunvegan Castle at her guest, Dr. Samuel Johnson.  'No, madam, no more than a wolf.'  That is quite past all question with all those who either in natural morals or in revealed religion look to and know and characterise themselves.  We have all an inborn propensity to dislike one another, and a very small provocation will suddenly blow that banked-up furnace into a flame. It is ever present with me, says self-examining Paul, and hence its so sudden and so destructive outbreaks.  So the written or the printed name of our enemy, his image in our mind, his passing step, his figure out of the window; his wife, his child, his carriage, his cart in the street, anything, everything will stir up our heart at the man we do not like.  And the whole of our so honest Bible, our present text, and the illustrations of our text in Judge Jeffreys' and Judge Hate-good's courts, all go to show that the better a man is the more sometimes will we hate him.  Good men, better men than we are, men who in public life and in private life pursue great and good ends, of necessity cross and go counter to us in our pursuit of small, selfish, evil ends, and of necessity we hate them.  For, cross a selfish sinner sufficiently and you have a very devil--as many good men, if they knew it, have in us.  Again, good men who come into contact with us cannot help seeing our bad lives, our tempers, our selfishness, our public and private vices; and we see that they see us, and we cannot love those whose averted eye so goes to our conscience.  And not only in the hatred of good men, but if you know of God how to watch yourselves, you will find yourselves out every day also in the hatred of good movements, good causes, good institutions, and good works.  There are doctors who would far rather hear of their rival's patient expiring in his hands than hear their rival's success trumpeted through all the town.  There are ministers, also, who would rather that the masses of the city and the country sank yet deeper into improvidence and drink and neglect of ordinances than that they were rescued by any other church than their own.  They hate to hear of the successes of another church.  There are party politicians who would rather that the ship of the state ran on the rocks both in her home and her foreign policy than that the opposite party should steer her amid a nation's cheers into harbour.  And so of good news.  I will stake the divine truth of this evening's Scriptures, and of their historical and imaginative illustrations, on the feelings, if you know how to observe, detect, characterise, and confess them,--the feelings, I say, that will rise in your heart to-morrow morning when you read what is good news to other men, even to good men, and to the families and family interests of good men.  It does not matter one atom into what profession, office, occupation, interest you track the corrupt heart of man, as sure as a substance casts a shadow, so sure will you find your own selfish heart hating goodness when the goodness does not serve or flatter you.\\n\\nNow, though they will never be many, yet there must be some men among us, one here and another there, who have so looked at and found out themselves.  I can well believe that some men here came up to this house to-night trembling in their heart all the way. They felt the very advertisement go through them like a knife: they felt that they were summoned up hither almost by name as to judgment.  For they feel every day, though they have never told their feelings to any, that they have this horrible heart deep- seated within them to love evil and to hate good.  They gnash their teeth at themselves as they catch themselves rejoicing in iniquity. They feel their hearts expanding, and they know that their faces shine, when you tell them evil tidings.  They sicken and lose heart and sit solitary when you carry to them a good report.  They feel as John Bunyan felt, that no one but the devil can equal them in pollution of heart.  And their wonder sometimes is that the Searcher of Hearts does not drive them down where devils dwell and hate God and man and one another.  They look around them when the penitential psalm is being sung, and they smile bitterly to themselves.  O people of God, they say, you do not know what you are saying.  Leave that psalm to me.  I can sing it.  I can tell to God what He knows about sin, and about sin in the heart.  Stand away back from me, that man says, for I am a leper.  The chief of sinners is beside you.  A whited sepulchre stands open beside you.- -Stop now, O hating and hateful man, and let me speak for a single moment before we separate.  Before you say any more about yourself, and before you leave the house of God, lift up your broken heart and with all your might bless God that He has opened your eyes and taught you how to look at yourself and how to hate yourself.  There are hundreds of honest Christian men and women in this house at this moment to whom God has not done as, in His free grace, He has done to you.  For He has not only begun a good work in you, but He has begun that special and peculiar work which, when it goes on to perfection, makes a great and an eminent saint of God.  To know your own heart as you evidently know it, and to hate it as you say you hate it, and to hunger after a clean heart as, with every breath, you hunger,--all that, if you would only believe it, sets you, or will yet set you, high up among the people of God.  Be comforted; it is your bounden duty to be comforted.  God deserves it at your hands that you be more than comforted amid such unmistakable signs of His eminent grace to you.  And be patient under your exceptional sanctification.  Rome was not built in a day.  You cannot reverse the awful law of your sanctification.  You cannot be saved by Jesus Christ and His Holy Spirit without seeing yourself, and you cannot see yourself without hating yourself, and you cannot begin to hate yourself without all your hatred henceforth turning against yourself.  You are deep in the red-hot bosom of the refiner's fire.  And when you are once sufficiently tried by the Divine Refiner of Souls, He will in His own good time and way bring you out as gold.  Be patient, therefore, till the coming of the Lord.  And say continually amid all your increasing knowledge of yourself, and amid all your increasing hatred of yourself, 'As for me, I will behold Thy face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when I awake with Thy likeness.'\\n\\nFAITHFUL IN VANITY FAIR {2}\\n\\n'Be thou faithful.'--Rev. 2. 10.\\n\\nThe breadth of John Bunyan's mind, the largeness of his heart, and the tolerance of his temper all come excellently out in his fine portrait of Faithful.  New beginners in personal religion, when they first take up The Pilgrim's Progress in earnest, always try to find out something in themselves that shall somewhat correspond to the recorded experience of Christian, the chief pilgrim.  And they are afraid that all is not right with them unless they, like him, have had, to begin with, a heavy burden on their back.  They look for something in their religious life that shall answer to the Slough of Despond also, to the Hill Difficulty, to the House Beautiful, and, especially and indispensably, to the place somewhat ascending with a cross upon it and an open sepulchre beneath it. And because they cannot always find all these things in themselves in the exact order and in the full power in which they are told of Christian in Bunyan's book, they begin to have doubts about themselves as to whether they are true pilgrims at all.  But here is Faithful, with whom Christian held such sweet and confidential discourse, and yet he had come through not a single one of all these things.  The two pilgrims had come from the same City of Destruction indeed, and they had met at the gate of Vanity and passed through Vanity Fair together, but, till they embraced one another again in the Celestial City, that was absolutely all the experience they had in common.  Faithful had never had any such burden on his back as that was which had for so long crushed Christian to the earth.  And the all but complete absence of such a burden may have helped to let Faithful get over the Slough of Despond dry shod.  He had the good lot to escape Sinai also and the Hill Difficulty, and his passing by the House Beautiful and not making the acquaintance of Discretion and Prudence and Charity may have had something to do with the fact that one named Wanton had like to have done him such a mischief.  His remarkable experiences, however, with Adam the First, with Moses, and then with the Man with holes in His hands, all that makes up a page in Faithful's autobiography we could ill have spared.  His encounter with Shame also, and soon afterwards with Talkative, are classical passages in his so individual history.  Altogether, it would be almost impossible for us to imagine two pilgrims talking so heartily together, and yet so completely unlike one another.  A very important lesson surely as to how we should abstain from measuring other men by ourselves, as well as ourselves by other men; an excellent lesson also as to how we should learn to allow for all possible varieties among good men, both in their opinions, their experiences, and their attainments.  True Puritan as the author of The Pilgrim's Progress is, he is no Procrustes.  He does not cut down all his pilgrims to one size, nor does he clip them all into one pattern.  They are all thinking men, but they are not all men of one way of thinking.  John Bunyan is as fresh as Nature herself, and as free and full as Holy Scripture herself in the variety, in the individuality, and even in the idiosyncrasy of his spiritual portrait gallery.\",\"timestamp\":1641289277,\"title\":\"\\nBut, especially, said Charity, as your boys grew up--I think you said that you had four boys and no girls?\"},\"digest\":\"_pBmEd0cEGt6BWF77-EDcSA83TEYbwaAUCQoztxP-Bk\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6b55Ba15E3e103d91f6dec37dd48B84ddF5B245C\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_rRtvHlo680Wm9hT1cO_1NcXEOCunlPABVTDtsy8o8Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"myWdhVYmyrxH7ZRqFT__Xnw20NsnQIregbdX1Z9D1os\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"g2HiuVEuHNiA4AqM9K-p30ewSlbKvB4pTRd5Vyu2KBqaoO3fl1hD9Su3Jd-mccsSKYFWqRXgAEF7da7OCPJz2A\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x3703b460fa70b0997084914d4f8abcf2d1dbc64f0d64c6cf3739a1b21897d1c35f96c7a9e934da0a802bc258abc11a5bdf9c8865f507dc9d69dfe089f2cf0b6d1c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"_rRtvHlo680Wm9hT1cO_1NcXEOCunlPABVTDtsy8o8Q\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"myWdhVYmyrxH7ZRqFT__Xnw20NsnQIregbdX1Z9D1os\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"_pBmEd0cEGt6BWF77-EDcSA83TEYbwaAUCQoztxP-Bk\"}"
