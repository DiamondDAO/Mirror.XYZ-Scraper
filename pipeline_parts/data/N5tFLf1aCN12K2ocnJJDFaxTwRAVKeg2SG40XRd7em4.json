"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I had a brief exchange with @leifengcrypto today as I saw he recently dumped all his holdings at the floor price: <https://opensea.io/leifeng?tab=activity>\\nWhen I mentioned the reason, his original comment was: rubbish Meka, no integrity.\\n\\nLater communicated with other BIG holders (one of them holds 46, several others each holding more than ten, and all at 4-6eth average price). The problems they responded to were\\n\\n1. certainly understand that the NFT market is now in a short bear market ,but Meka's team has no background in community operations and in the face of such tremendous heat is just watching it drain away every day. When faced with all the initial questions, the team did not react in any timely manner (this reaction should have been immediate and quick, with a clarifying announcement within hours, otherwise everyone would have defaulted to the fact that it was all true), and it was only days later that the official team reposted a behind-the-scenes story from one of the partner teams.(Not many people would take the initiative to click on an article.) But still, there was no sign of PR, nothing changed for all the KOLs and the impression continued to be fed to everyone that the Meka draw was not fair. This is a major PR failure. That's when people start to stop to trust you. And along with the bear market, the price kept collapsing. To this day, the team still shows no signs of PR.\\n2. You guys came up with the name Mekaverse and chased the Metaverse craze, but didn't do anything related to it. Instead, you focus on physical 3D printing. This makes them feel duped.\\n3. No experience in running a community. The team didn't seem to care as the community's buzz continued to wane. Rather, they remained focused on starting a company and making 3D models (this was the impression the team gave them, and as to why it brought this impression, it was also a failure in messaging)\\n\\nFinally, they suggest that\\n\\n1. build the PR and marketing team as soon as possible.\\n2. Listen more carefully to the ideas of the holders, especially the big holders, they are the ones with money and resources and blockchain background, they are the ones who introduce and refer the VC or PR resources, they really want to help Meka grow.\\n3. update the roadmap as soon as possible ditching the physical and focusing on the online art. Regarding the 3D model, the team can make a very nice model, or a very big one, as a marketing tool, but never try to tie it to NFT. Because NFT is a digital asset, its value and his meaning are recursive: its meaning comes from its high price, and its high price is related to its meaning. Once it is given an entity, then its value immediately loses this recursion and becomes tied to the physical price. And the act of giving away 3D models goes far against the spirit of the blockchain: anonymity and decentralisation. 3D models should be used as a marketing tool or a personal hobby of the creator, not as a core pursuit of the project. It should be even less of a major object for the team at the moment.\\n4. Regarding airdrops, learn more from the practices of other projects and link them to raising the floor price, boosting community activity, and raising everyone's holdings from time to time: for example, randomly dropping rare airdrops, this bot can be combined with the original NFT to bring a huge increase in value to the original NFT (similar to BYAC's mutation potion).\\n5. The remaining 300 could be gifted to some Twitter celebrities, and sports personalities, etc., but this should be part of the PR, and would require a lot of article placement first to address the impression of Meka as a previous fraud. Secondly work with celebrities to bring in new exposure. Regarding the raffle, don't give it away pointlessly to strangers who resell it, or there will be a bunch of bots flooding the discord. it can be given to those who contribute the most to the community;boost community activity; give it to celebrities; or give it away in a raffle within people who have been delist for more than XX days,the more delist the more chance you will have. All airdrops and raffles must be designed to: increase community activity, expand reach, delist, increase potential revenue for holders, and promote buy-in; anything else that simply re-posts the raffle is a pointless waste of time.\\n\\nThey would like to send one or two representatives to have a short video exchange (5-10 minutes) with the founding team to ask some questions about the development of the team and to offer some possible collaboration plans. They have French translator, so the whole communication is in French.\\n\\nIf you have any feedback on what they think, please let me know and I will pass it on, or try to arrange direct communication.\",\"timestamp\":1635637434,\"title\":\"Summary of comments from Chinese holders\"},\"digest\":\"FEeQ0mjtDnnZZHDzT2QcGiSNT4qhChriAFavlfByUUU\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x339568150A9ecC29dFf2C781f3ECb5e21d7b70FF\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fmvjWptJZ4KlBeX4SaMlV1Mm_vijh079CjenL3yTz0c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P92Kqra-3nOAKHZrbhp7LCreGsspCyERLUBjaxKUPzc\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"eEx3lmDbANGxytxtR4WNBjwGq3p1DlV9nRwDZoL8uBsz9Ace6cJ8gEoTz5Q0Bemkk_wMEq-Y-X3mBzrNSR-pKA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x23ffd7dcb034bb26ad7b6f668552cbd421cd1a255972ad97a1c4fc8ddc1ce7085b6d04a7c1b337ceee4839b525112717bce140167bbe0490dedc96298db259e11c\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"fmvjWptJZ4KlBeX4SaMlV1Mm_vijh079CjenL3yTz0c\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"P92Kqra-3nOAKHZrbhp7LCreGsspCyERLUBjaxKUPzc\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"nWMuLbrj_xQo-V3rCrAip07v6B2p-igqrsm4S2zhtqo\"}"
