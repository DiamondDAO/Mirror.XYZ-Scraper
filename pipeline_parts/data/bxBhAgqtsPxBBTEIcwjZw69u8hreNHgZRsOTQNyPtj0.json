Captained by an ambitious and all round nice guy OneTrueKirk it has certainly captured the imagination of the Ohmies and was the very first protocol to join Olympus Incubator. Don’t be surprised to see PCV protocols inhale VOLT starting with Olympus, but likely Frax and Fei too.\\n\\nWith some of the biggest DAOs at its back and a long list of the top angels in the space - don’t be surprised if this protocol launches with a FDV in the hundreds of millions.\\n\\nOlympus managed to snag a 6% share of the VCON governance token as a part of the Incubator deal.\\n\\n[https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/420-volt-protocol-joins-olympus-incubator-program](https://forum.olympusdao.finance/d/420-volt-protocol-joins-olympus-incubator-program)\\n\\n## Redacted\\n\\n* Olympus x Redacted double fly wheel - Olympus is generating a stream of productive assets from Redacted and Redacted is consuming a large amount of OHM. Olympus:\\n  * Owns 20% of pBTRFLY and earns 5% of distributed BTRFLY\\n  * Receives 20% of bribe revenue\\n  * Receives 5% of paid out BTRFLY when users bond:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/l0UNa4VSyTHcOXdG7v-xX.png?height=50&width=669)\\n\\n* Receives 5% of bonded assets currently CRV, CVX, OHM-BTRFLY:\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/jCGwsVtua1fy3hNH7XWPy.png?height=47&width=657)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/JSBU2vjoTSs2vqzG4kNjG.png?height=49&width=658)\\n\\n![](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/KjYaaQQcLotFHntJldgM5.png?height=49&width=679)\\n\\n* The above is just from this last 2 weeks - imagine what it will be in a few months.\\n* Soon this will probably include DPX, FXS, FXS-cvxFXS, SPELL and others.\\n* Redacted generates massive value for Olympus and since Redacted will own a huge amount of OHM - it turns a double flywheel for both Olympus and Redacted.\\n* A large amount of the treasury assets can be viewed in this wallet bundle\\n\\n  <https://zapper.fi/bundle/0x9a315bdf513367c0377fb36545857d12e85813ef,0x31f8cc382c9898b273eff4e0b7626a6987c846e8,0x408a9a09d97103022f53300a3a14ca6c3ff867e8,0x10b569271912cd3342d183c0f2dc4b5d5880b741,0x0e1177e47151be72e5992e0975000e73ab5fd9d4,0x0316508a1b5abf1cae42912dc2c8b9774b682ffc,0xe06efa3d9ee6923240ee1195a16ddd96b5cce8f7,0x2bc001ffeb862d843e0a02a7163c7d4828e5fb10,0xdfc95aaf0a107daae2b350458ded4b7906e7f728?label=&id=>\\n\\n## Concave\\n\\nLittle is known of the Concave Co-op, except their objective is to create a spoon (as opposed to a fork) and spoon back value to Olympus from all the forks far and wide. We expect to see the Olympus treasury to start filling up with tributes, perhaps even becoming a whale in some of these forks in time… now that would be poetic. Expect more details and a launch in early January.

Olympus receives a smaller 1.1% fee on all bonds to Lobis and - as they are just gearing up - this has amounted to just 196 LOBI at a current market price of $76K:\\n\\n![https://debank.com/profile/0x245cc372c84b3645bf0ffe6538620b04a217988b ](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/5YAGcW3f_uloJ-vw3Uwjn.png?height=42&width=935)\\n\\n* Olympus also holds about $6 million OHM-LOBI liquidity given to Olympus at launch - this will soon be bonded back at a handsome discount for even more LOBI token.\\n\\n![https://debank.com/profile/0x245cc372c84b3645bf0ffe6538620b04a217988b](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/ciHIxLEKBKpxNazK2HbIs.png?height=52&width=925)\\n\\n![https://forum.olympusdao.finance/u/LobisFinance](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/AbtEDnGJNyFBYhv7z_0B7.png?height=419&width=1021)\\n\\n* Assuming Olympus would receive a 10% discount on bonding the liquidity - it would then own 35.4% of all LOBI in circulation.\\n* Lobis treasury currently holds $1.891 million in TOKE, $5.6 million in CRV and $9.7 million in FXS - Olympus would by proxy control $6 million of the underlying assets - and that same portion of any FPI airdrop to come.\\n\\n## Phantom DAO\\n\\nCasper and Nearlyheadlessnick are two Ohmies and operators who saw a niche and grabbed it - throw in the backing of the Bong Bear community - and you get a powerhouse Olympus DAO outpost on the up and coming Fantom blockchain.\\n\\nLaunching with a Fantom focused accelerator, a reimplementation of the Olympus code and going DAO first from day one - the founders passed the muster at their Olympus AMA and sailed through a governance vote to become an endorsed fork on Fantom.

Targeting an underserved market in the space, it seems like the moment for founders William X and Kiba to build out their ambitious vision. Sharing Olympus’ values and wanting them embedded within the Debt DAO community, Kiba and William impressed at an Olympus AMA - leading to a formal partnership with the decentralized reserve bank.\\n\\n[https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1238991857](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1238991857)\\n\\nWith Olympus brimming with capital ready to put to work and holding a 3.3% stake in Debt DAO - the upcoming launch and LBP promises to big.

What you might not know is that a number of grants have already been approved and teams are building out new products, services and integrations across web3 - some of them will drive demand for OHM and some of them will be a healthy source of revenue.\\n\\nOlympus Give and the underlying Tyche technology to redirect rebases - is going see an explosion of use cases for OHM into 2022:\\n\\n![OlympusDAO](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/9SIg862r0fGTScLd_8MU9.png?height=503&width=844)\\n\\nThere are already a number of teams building on-top of the new DeFi primitive which is yield redirection - some of them are gonna change the game…\\n\\n## Incubator\\n\\nKeep your eyes peeled for the next Incubator partner with a similar ambition and allocation as Volt - scheduled for announcement in early Jan:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Olympusincubate/status/1476431416250433540](https://twitter.com/Olympusincubate/status/1476431416250433540)\\n\\n## Odyssey - NFT's & the OhmieSea\\n\\nThe Olympus Odyssey subDAO is incubating and partnering to launch and support a number of number of NFT projects, games and protocols with sustainable service fees:\\n\\n[https://twitter.com/Memetics33/status/1477349632372092928](https://twitter.com/Memetics33/status/1477349632372092928)\\n\\nYou’ve surely heard of OwenSea - but have you heard of OhmieSea - this has been in development since April 2021 and will launch in March 2022.\\n\\nWatch this space.\\n\\n## OHM in Treasuries\\n\\nSmart protocols like Fiat DAO, TreasureDAO and Growth DeFi are already stacking gOHM in their treasuries - because they can see the coming OHM wars.
