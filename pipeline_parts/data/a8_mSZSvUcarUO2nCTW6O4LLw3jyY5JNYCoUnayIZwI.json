"{\"content\":{\"body\":\"I have rested for a week. I began to feel bored. So I went out with my friends. They are my best friends in the middle school. We didn't go to someplace special. We just saw the other. We had lunch together. While we were having lunch, we were still talking about the new school and new friends. Yes! A year later, we have grown riper. And we learned much more things and got new life. We haven't enough time to play, to waste and to lose the way. We only have two years. Two years to go, we will get the real life which belongs to us.\",\"timestamp\":1639103610,\"title\":\"My friends and I\"},\"digest\":\"8cAOj-ZtciyJLomeNkU5VaKeO6uTh6g4KVXp7g9v_NI\",\"authorship\":{\"contributor\":\"0x6E158aaCaA912b6f02Aad6F98031D7c3e067a4c9\",\"signingKey\":\"{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b-M2Ra6m1xT3LFZclHi_T2J5_YebRjSaXY3yvuS2new\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MgsgYcRRdKxNgKlj8FuFvePgprngMNwQgSzHREJKIuU\\\"}\",\"signature\":\"EF67704mdySDabXhp8rDa_HDiV99sKFnBbeMjrVFFTZukd4V17JqJCV61v8cUIQASiVcMdcj1sAxN_cyZqfJNA\",\"signingKeySignature\":\"0x4a68a10f6a9773f0b2a7c07a28cd350e10849757303d30db2c40951e7640476e2eecdc865aa08852481805ea0a5b9816c4b15eb9ae3cea2265757b4045706be61b\",\"signingKeyMessage\":\"I authorize publishing on mirror.xyz from this device using:\\n{\\\"crv\\\":\\\"P-256\\\",\\\"ext\\\":true,\\\"key_ops\\\":[\\\"verify\\\"],\\\"kty\\\":\\\"EC\\\",\\\"x\\\":\\\"b-M2Ra6m1xT3LFZclHi_T2J5_YebRjSaXY3yvuS2new\\\",\\\"y\\\":\\\"MgsgYcRRdKxNgKlj8FuFvePgprngMNwQgSzHREJKIuU\\\"}\",\"algorithm\":{\"name\":\"ECDSA\",\"hash\":\"SHA-256\"}},\"nft\":{},\"version\":\"12-21-2020\",\"originalDigest\":\"8cAOj-ZtciyJLomeNkU5VaKeO6uTh6g4KVXp7g9v_NI\"}"
